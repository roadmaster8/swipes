Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are exploring our world (trying to figure out the nature of reality and truth, and possibly doing some kung-fu). A model of our world needs to live on our server, but also on each of their client devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Neo’s device, for example, needs to have a complete and consistent model of our world at all times to accurately render what’s happening and predict what will happen next. If his model diverges from the server model, or from the models seen by Trinity and Morpheus, he’ll experience a glitch in the Matrix, and reality itself may start to unravel!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What we need to provide each client is a consistent, ordered sequence of events that communicate everything that happens in the world. As long as all clients see this same ordered sequence of events (and assuming we didn’t write bugs or non-determinism), each client should be able to produce an identical model. If any events are missing or arrive out of order, bad things might happen. We’d also like updates to arrive as quickly as humanly (machinely?) possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Open sourcing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/go/tree/master/eventstream&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;EventStream&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we’ve needed to solve problems like this several times, and we’re happy to share our core abstraction: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/go/tree/master/eventstream&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;EventStream&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. An EventStream is an ordered sequence of events connecting a single publisher to multiple subscribers. In a traditional Go channel, multiple readers compete to pull events from the channel, but in EventStream every subscriber sees the entire sequence of events. It’s like an immutable, append-only log with one writer and multiple readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why EventStream?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’ll talk about more interesting, real-world use cases below, but for now consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://bwamp.me/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;BWAMP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (If you’re not already a &lt;b&gt;BWAMP&lt;/b&gt; user, you can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fun-virtual-team-meeting/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) Under the hood, &lt;b&gt;BWAMP&lt;/b&gt; works like a simple online chat room with no history. Clients need to be told two kinds of things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chat: person X sent &lt;b&gt;BWAMP&lt;/b&gt; Y&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Membership: persons X, Y, and Z are currently in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Chat events take advantage of EventStream’s fast, consistent updates, instantly pushing updates to all connected clients. We can be sure that everyone in the room is seeing the exact same series of &lt;b&gt;BWAMP&lt;/b&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Membership events communicate when someone joins or leaves the room, so that all clients can maintain an accurate and up-to-date membership list. When a client first connects to a room, the server sends the complete list of all the current members, which clients store locally. Whenever someone joins or leaves, the server publishes an appropriate join or leave event. Connected clients apply these mutations to their user list, and everyone now has the same updated user list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ll talk more about this later in the section on &lt;a href=&quot;#log-replicated-model&quot;&gt;Log-replicated Model&lt;/a&gt;, but first let’s talk about how EventStream is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How EventStream works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Under the hood, EventStream is a linked list connecting a single publisher to multiple subscribers. The publisher keeps a reference to the &lt;i&gt;tail&lt;/i&gt; of the list, so that it can publish new events by appending new nodes to the list. The tail node is “unready”.  Every prior node in the list is “ready”.  Publishing a new event marks the current tail node ready and appends a new unready node to be the new tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each subscriber keeps its own reference to the first node it has not yet consumed. Subscribers iterate towards the tail of the list as they consume events. In the steady state, all subscribers will have iterated to the tail of the list, waiting for the next event to be published. Old nodes become unreachable (in the GC sense) once all subscribers have consumed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;An EventStream is a linked list.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the diagram above, Neo has consumed all ready nodes. He is waiting for the publisher to provide the next value and mark the tail node as ready. Trinity and Morpheus lag behind, having more nodes to consume. All older nodes (not pictured) are unreachable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The internal structure of a node looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The tail of the list is the only node in an “unready” state. Its &lt;code&gt;ready&lt;/code&gt; channel is not yet closed, and its value and next pointer are both &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;. To publish a new event we must:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assign the new event value into &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a new &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; to become the new tail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Link the old tail to the new tail by assigning old tail’s &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt; to be the new tail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the &lt;code&gt;ready&lt;/code&gt; channel on the old tail, signaling subscribers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Closing the &lt;code&gt;ready&lt;/code&gt; channel signals that a new event has been published, and serves as a data synchronization barrier in the Go memory model. Because all subscribers receive a copy of each value sent through the stream, all event values need to be effectively immutable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;EventStream subscribers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A typical subscriber is an HTTP or gRPC stream handler whose inner loop looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As soon as the &lt;code&gt;ready&lt;/code&gt; channel closes, all subscribers (parked on the &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; statement) unpark and process the new event. (Aside: if you’re curious about the Go &lt;code&gt;select &lt;/code&gt;statement and why I’m using one here, see the section on &lt;b&gt;Using select&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/why-errgroup-withcontext-in-golang-server-handlers/#using-select&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;this prior blog post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For the simple case where you only need to select over the EventStream plus the context, we provide an &lt;code&gt;Iterator&lt;/code&gt; decorator that yields a terser formulation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Log-replicated Model&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So now we know what EventStream is and how it works, but how can we take advantage of it in the real world? The real power lies in the design patterns we build around EventStream. The primary design pattern we use is something I’ll call the “Log-replicated Model”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To ensure that distributed clients reach the same, eventually consistent server state:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We define a model that we share between a server and all of its clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server owns the original source-of-truth model, controls any changes to it, and publishes mutation events to an EventStream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each client gets an initial snapshot of the model plus a subscription to the EventStream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Log-replicated Model is much simpler than a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) or Operational Transformation (OT) model. In those more sophisticated models, distributed actors can apply concurrent mutations that must be merged together, potentially in different orders, to produce a consistent result. A Log-replicated Model has a single source of truth and a single ordered sequence of mutations. It’s much easier to implement correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’ll unpack this below, but first, I should offer a couple of real world examples of how we’ve put this into practice (beyond just &lt;b&gt;BWAMP&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Real-world example #1: Solr monitor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we run hundreds of &lt;a href=&quot;https://solr.apache.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Apache Solr&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instances, containing tens of thousands of collections and hundreds of thousands of individual shard replicas. Solr keeps all of its configuration in &lt;a href=&quot;https://zookeeper.apache.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zookeeper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so if we need to know the IP address of a Solr instance, or better yet, which Solr node a specific collection and shard lives on, we have to ask Zookeeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But asking Zookeeper for routing information in the critical path of serving user queries added too much latency, and querying Zookeeper each time we needed to &lt;i&gt;index&lt;/i&gt; a document would have made Zookeeper explode. We needed an up-to-date model of Solr’s routing information in each Solr client, so we wrote a sophisticated library using Zookeeper “watches” – which allow a client to read a piece of data, and then be notified the next time that piece of data changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This solution worked well at the time, and we even open-sourced it as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/gosolr/tree/master/solrmonitor&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;solrmonitor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But we knew from the outset that this design would burden Zookeeper with &lt;code&gt;O(N*M)&lt;/code&gt; load as FullStory grew: (number of collections) * (number of Solr client instances). Zookeeper’s load began to rise sharply as our indexing service scaled up each day.  As each new client came online, it needed to fetch a copy of the cluster state from Zookeeper and set watches). The number of watches registered with Zookeeper grew into the millions. We needed a better design!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reworking &lt;code&gt;solrmonitor&lt;/code&gt; into a service provided that better design. We took the existing &lt;code&gt;solrmonitor&lt;/code&gt; library and embedded it into a new gRPC streaming service backed by EventStream. Then we replaced the embedded, ZK based library in every other service with a gRPC client connected to &lt;code&gt;solrmonitor&lt;/code&gt; service. A small number of &lt;code&gt;solrmonitor&lt;/code&gt; servers talking directly to Zookeeper act as a massive force multiplier, publishing a Log-replicated Model far more efficiently than Zookeeper could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you tell when we started and finished rolling out to all clients?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Zookeeper watch counts dropped to acceptable levels, the induced-load spikes completely vanished, and the &lt;code&gt;solrmonitor&lt;/code&gt; service itself needed fewer resources than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Real-world example #2: Webhook configuration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045134554-Webhooks&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Webhooks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; allow FullStory customers to provide other applications with real-time information, delivering data to other applications as it happens. For example, customers may want to be notified via HTTP whenever a certain &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623274-FS-event-API-Sending-custom-event-data-into-FullStory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Custom Event&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our indexing pipeline processes custom events, but it doesn’t know anything about webhooks. Instead, our pipeline notifies a dedicated microservice, &lt;code&gt;capnhook&lt;/code&gt;, which is responsible for delivering webhooks. &lt;code&gt;capnhook&lt;/code&gt; also owns and manages the customer configuration of webhooks– which events should trigger notifications for each customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, this design exemplified a common microservice problem: clean separation of concerns can lead to gross systemic inefficiencies. While FullStory processes millions of custom events per hour, only a tiny fraction trigger webhook notifications. Since our indexing pipeline could not tell the difference, it simply sent &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; custom event to &lt;code&gt;capnhook&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;capnhook&lt;/code&gt; would then throw most of them away, but the sheer number of gRPC requests made &lt;code&gt;capnhook&lt;/code&gt; an order of magnitude more expensive than it needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It dawned on us that the total size of our entire webhook configuration (across all customers) is actually pretty small. Small enough to easily fit into memory. Small enough to apply the Log-replicated Model approach, wire up an EventStream over gRPC, and simply publish the entire model to every instance in our indexing pipeline. Now that the indexing pipeline has an accurate local model, it can cheaply filter events and only call &lt;code&gt;capnhook&lt;/code&gt; for events that actually trigger webhooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The most expensive no-ops you’ve ever seen.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our indexing pipeline got more efficient, and the results for &lt;code&gt;capnhook&lt;/code&gt; were huge: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;gRPC requests dropped by 90%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPU usage and resource requirements dropped by 90%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logging size dropped by 95%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to write a Log-replicated Model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The following idealized Go struct demonstrates the server side of a Log-replicated Model:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; abstractly represents some real, useful data model. We often design the model to be immutable and use copy-on-write to apply mutations. But sometimes it’s easier to make the model mutable and use copy-on-read instead. The important point is that once &lt;code&gt;ReadAndSubscribe&lt;/code&gt; returns the &lt;code&gt;Model&lt;/code&gt; back to the caller, it must be effectively immutable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Mutation&lt;/code&gt; events must also be effectively immutable. As noted above, all stream values must be immutable to be safely shared among subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The read/write mutex (guarding both the snapshot and the EventStream) ensures that all clients observe a consistent association between the model and the stream. The snapshot is bound to a specific point in the stream: all previous mutations have been applied, and all subsequent mutations have not been applied. As long as mutations are applied deterministically, all subscribers will maintain identical models over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;EventStream and gRPC streams&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve talked about the underlying mechanics of EventStream and the Log-replicated Model, but how do we actually wire up clients and servers? At FullStory, we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://grpc.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gRPC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for all our service-to-service communication, and gRPC server streams are an excellent fit for EventStream. gRPC streams backed by EventStream power all of the use cases I’ve talked about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Smart clients utilizing gRPC streams are typically provided by the service owners, because getting the nuances exactly right can be tricky. We put together a sample application to demonstrate how to write both server and client implementations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Chatterbox sample&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/go/tree/master/examples/chatterbox&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;chatterbox&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sample is a gRPC streaming application that implements a simple command line chat service. It illustrates all of the pieces we’ve talked about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;EventStream&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Log-replicated Model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutation events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;gRPC streams (both server streams and bi-di)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart gRPC stream clients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can peruse the code at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/go/tree/master/examples/chatterbox&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;github.com/fullstorydev/go/examples/chatterbox&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I recommend trying it out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I don’t have space here to thoroughly describe everything in the sample, but I’ll try to hit some of the key points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monitoring client synchronously fetches a complete model from the server before returning control to the caller, and errors if it cannot. We write clients this way because we find it more robust to have microservices fail-fast on startup if they encounter problems. We don’t want a service instance to get into the “ready” state if it isn’t fully prepared to operate on a complete model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After startup, the monitoring client runs an infinite loop, creating new gRPC streams whenever the old one is lost. New streams create a new model from scratch to replace the model from the previous stream (we may not be reconnecting to the same server instance, or even the same server version).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Client and Monitor intentionally duplicate a lot of code so that each example is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two different Model implementations illustrate copy-on-read vs. copy-on-write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I hope you&amp;#x27;ve found this article both interesting and useful.

Their team has released an integration with FullStory to help developers tap into the power of user sessions recording on bugs reported by end-users and clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I love FullStory!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;As a matter of fact, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marker.io&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Marker.io&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; has been a paid customer of FullStory for over 4 years. Here is proof of my very first invoice!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For us, the thing that makes FullStory infinitely valuable is how easy it is to understand and reproduce user bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, when a user reports a bug, we can look for that user&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in FullStory and understand the exact steps that led to a bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unlike other tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/DXI-fullstory-google-analytics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where you don’t know exactly what your user saw or experienced, FullStory gives you that power out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finding the correct session recording&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marker.io/fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Marker.io integration with FullStory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, helping your dev team find the exact FullStory session to look at has never been easier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When someone reports a bug through the Marker.io web widget, it will connect with FullStory and record the &lt;b&gt;exact&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;moment&lt;/b&gt; on the FullStory timeline at which a user experiences a bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Let users report bugs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The marker.io website widget allows users and internal team members to report visual bugs without leaving your web app or website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You embed a snippet of code in your website, and people will be able to report bugs with visual annotations and a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, imagine a user tries to purchase a plan for your SaaS app, but they get an error. With the marker.io widget installed, this is how easy it is for them to report that bug to you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Receive the issue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you install the Marker.io website widget, you will be able to receive that issue into your favorite Jira project, GitHub repository, Trello board, or any of the&lt;a href=&quot;https://marker.io/integrations&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;other integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Marker.io supports natively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That’s where the magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623514-How-do-I-get-FullStory-up-and-running-on-my-site-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory script&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; installed on the same website as the Marker.io snippet code, we will automatically grab the FullStory user session and attach it as a quick link inside your issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here is an example of that issue created by Marker.io inside Jira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Marker.io will not only capture the correct FullStory user session, it will also send you to the exact moment the person reported the issue in the FullStory session timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This way, when your developer clicks this link, they will instantly navigate to the precise timestamp on the FullStory timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From here, your development team can tap into the full power of FullStory and look at&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828533-How-do-I-use-the-FullStory-Console-&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;console logs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, networks, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Closing the issue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, when your developers have resolved the issue, they can close it inside their favorite project management tool. (In this example, that’s Jira.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By doing so, Marker.io will automatically notify the reporter that the bug has been resolved. What a way to offer excellent customer support!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thanks to this new integration, you can review user sessions to understand the steps that led to bugs, right from inside your favorite issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And for your users and teammates, feedback reporting could not be more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAYFZPmIaGw&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here is a short 3-minute demo that shows exactly how the integration works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why you should be using errgroup.WithContext() in your Golang server handlers]]></title><description><![CDATA[How using errgroup.WithContext() can shave a few more milliseconds off of your end user latencies. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/why-errgroup-withcontext-in-golang-server-handlers</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/why-errgroup-withcontext-in-golang-server-handlers</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Blum]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2020 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The full story on conversion funnel analysis]]></title><description><![CDATA[A funnel tool for web analytics able to generate path analysis on the fly based on events and user attributes in any linear or non-linear order.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-fullstory-on-funnels</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-fullstory-on-funnels</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2018 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Updated March 24th, 2021&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article summary:&lt;/b&gt; Out of the box, FullStory offers funnel analysis capabilities that are flexible, powerful, and instrumentation-free. Here we explore how FullStory funnels solve three common problems with conversion funnels and help you optimize your key workflows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Funnels: Your users’ stories of success (or failure) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With roots that trace back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_funnel&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;1898&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the “purchase funnel” has traditionally been used to understand the steps along the path to conversion: Awareness, Interest, Desire, and Action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fast forward to today and the original purchase funnel has inspired sales funnels, marketing funnels, customer success funnels, conversion funnels, and many more. In the digital world, funnels help us measure if customers successfully move through multi-step workflows. And while that measurement is valuable, it’s no longer enough to simply know &lt;i&gt;how many&lt;/i&gt; customers complete a funnel. The real value lies in seeing and understanding &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; users behave the way they do &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/funnel-analysis-for-digital-experience/&quot;&gt;inside that funnel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Right out of the box, FullStory has a powerful conversion tool–one that allows you to create precise funnels based on user segments, events, and nuanced attributes that you choose. This lets you actually see why customers aren’t making it through a workflow as intended, so you can adjust accordingly to improve conversion rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And this is all possible without any advanced configuration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why traditional funnel tools fall short &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Funnel analyses are essential to conversion optimization, and they’ve become a standard part of web analytics reporting. But are they actually beneficial in this capacity? In many cases, funnel on the web have shortcomings that can diminish the value of their insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider these three common problems with traditional funnel analyses: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inability to analyze linear and nonlinear user flows:&lt;/b&gt; Historically, funnels occur in a particular, linear order (for example, Step 1, then 2, then 3). When user actions are sequential, it’s important to understand if they  follow the expected path. However, online user behavior is often not linear at all. They might hop around your navigation or jump into and out of search. They might engage with your site, leave, and come back later. The point is, there are many different paths users can take to conversion. This nonlinearity doesn’t make funnels irrelevant, though–it means that your funnel analysis must be flexible enough to capture complex paths and run numbers in myriad ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Implementation is complicated and time consuming: &lt;/b&gt;With traditional instrumentation methods, funnels can require lots of time to set up, which limits how much information you can capture and analyze. So, when you’re forced to enter the precise funnel path you want to monitor, you have to proactively define that path and then wait to get data. And if you set up the funnel incorrectly? That’s a whole other story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking limitations: &lt;/b&gt;Many web funnel tools will only let you enter funnel steps as URLs or pages visited. This means you have no way to investigate micro-steps like clicks, scrolling, and any number of other things that can happen once a user lands on a page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Any of the above problems can severely limit or skew the data you get from your funnel analyses. And, unfortunately, many web analytics tools &lt;a href=&quot;fullstory.com/blog/funnel-analysis-for-digital-experience&quot;&gt;don’t have the necessary user interaction data&lt;/a&gt; to create meaningful insights or the flexibility to effectively serve that data in funnel format. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Funnels n FullStory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Visited URLs, clicked CSS selectors, and any user interactions you want to analyze with FullStory Funnels &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory captures everything about your users’ online experiences to provide you qu&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;alitative insights&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But FullStory is far more than just a session replay tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unlike many analytics tools, FullStory indexes all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;captured data&lt;/a&gt; so that you can search through it and segment your sessions in nearly infinite ways. And FullStory requires no manual tagging–giving you the freedom to decide on-the-fly what you’d like to search and analyze. No matter how you slice and dice your data, FullStory will surface all of the sessions that match your search. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, FullStory allows you to aggregate data into Dashboards, for at-a-glance monitoring of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fullstory.com/quantitative-data&quot;&gt;quantitative insights&lt;/a&gt; like: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trends over time for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/graph-monthly-weekly-and-daily-active-user-trends-by-behavior-user-attribute/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;daily, weekly, and monthly active users&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/replay-your-most-frustrated-user-sessions-in-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;most frustrated sessions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within a user segment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/learn-from-power-users-and-improve-your-product/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;top users&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/list-your-top-rage-clicks-and-dead-clicks/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;most “Rage Clicked” items&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, top referrers, browsers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/heatmap/&quot;&gt;heatmaps&lt;/a&gt;, and more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;quantitative and qualitative one-two punch&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; means your high-level web analytics are always tied to real user experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This knockout combination is part of what makes FullStory Funnels so powerful. FullStory users can search for any event, refine the search results by applying a segment or specific user attributes to the search (like location, session length, browser), and FullStory will find those sessions &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;generate funnel analytics automatically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Stringing together whatever events you want to analyze is as easy as typing them into Omnisearch. Plus, the ability to specify whether you want to see events “in this order” or “in any order” solves one of the major problems of traditional funnel analytics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With FullStory Funnels, you can quite literally build a funnel for any user flow you can think of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Funnel examples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Funnels are made up of two or more events. In FullStory, the number of bars you add will correspond to the number of steps in your desired funnel. If no user sessions match the funnel you’ve created, FullStory will let you know so you can refine your search as needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Maybe the funnel you want to analyze is as simple as: users who, in this order, visited your website → interacted with a specific modal or overlay → clicked your call-to-action button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pretty straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The great part about the FullStory Funnels tool is that you can also create and analyze funnels that are far more complex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, Maybe you want to investigate the paid traffic to your top landing page → that sent users to your pricing page → where they interacted with your pricing configuration tool → then read a case study → left your site → but came back through a retargeting effort → and then converted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Again, simply search in FullStory for these events, and then add order, user, and session filters to refine your analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diagnose and optimize your conversion funnels using Session Replay &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you’ve identified the biggest leaks in any given funnel (and there may be more than one), it’s time to move from initial analysis to diagnosing the issues with session replay. Playing back user sessions allows you to see the on-page experience through your users’ eyes to get to the root cause of funnel drop out. Watching sessions can help you generate hypotheses to test, ideate experiments to run, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To make the most of your replay analysis, follow these steps: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save your funnel as a Segment to easily use it for future analysis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify which steps in your funnel you want to troubleshoot, and exclude the event filter at the point of failure. (Do this by dragging the event you want to troubleshoot to the “Exclude” section at the bottom of Event Filters. The session list in this revised query will only include sessions containing all the steps in your funnel &lt;i&gt;up until the drop out point. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch these sessions and take notes on any behavioral trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you replay sessions in your funnels, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/debugging-with-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;look for bugs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/7-causes-of-bad-user-experiences/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;misbehaving UX design&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as these could be the culprits of funnel drop-off. Once you’ve gotten a good sense of what’s going wrong in your funnel, it’s time to hypothesize, test, and experiment to optimize your funnel flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you’ve adjusted how users move through your funnel accordingly, let some user data accumulate and then run your funnel analysis again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To read more about using session replay for conversion rate optimization, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/how-to-use-session-replay-for-conversion-rate-optimization/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;check out these tips&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from our partners at UserConversion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get actionable insights with FullStory Funnels &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory Funnels are designed to be both powerful and highly user-friendly.

The principles were: single responsibility, composition, and testability. Using these three principles we then looked at an example of a React component called &lt;code&gt;StarWarsCharacters&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jcarroll2007/1cb61a6d9742533a3781369a067a43f4&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) that did not adhere to these principles, and I made a promise to you that we could make it better!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this part of the series, we’re going to talk about an implementation of the three principles from Part 1 as three distinct React component categories and then return to our &lt;code&gt;StarWarsCharacters&lt;/code&gt; example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Containers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Presentational Components&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before we dive into how we categorize components at FullStory, I want to quickly mention two component categories that you might have heard of before: &amp;quot;containers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;presentational components.&amp;quot; Containers are primarily concerned with how things work, and presentational components are concerned with how things look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dan Abramov (one of the core contributors to React) wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on these two types of components back in 2015. So, these concepts aren’t new, but you might have noticed that there was an update to that article in 2019 where Dan mentions that he has changed his view on these two categories. Since the introduction of React &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html&quot;&gt;hooks&lt;/a&gt;, he states that he no longer structures his applications this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, that begs the question, how should we structure our React apps? At FullStory we believe that we should not completely do away with these distinctions, but build upon them. Let me show you how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3 Categories of React Components&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we have 3 categories of React components. We call them &amp;quot;views&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;containers,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;components&amp;quot;. We will define these categories and show how they &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;adhere to the principles of single responsibility, composition, and testability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Views&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first category of components we will discuss are &amp;quot;view&amp;quot; components. At FullStory we define a &amp;quot;view&amp;quot; as a React component that has the single responsibility of defining the structure or section of a page. We define the structure of a page (or section of a page) as the routing and layout of other components that compose the page (or section).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The green and orange borders in the images above represent the boundaries of a couple of different views. The orange border view renders a header and the green border view. If the URL changes then the green bordered view will render different grey boxes. At this point the grey boxes aren’t particularly meaningful, but this purposefully represents the extent of the responsibilities of a view. Reminder: a &amp;quot;view&amp;quot; handles defining the layout of a page or section of a page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Traits of a View&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We define the different traits and rules of a view as the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A view should define routing (usually through tools provided by routing libraries like &lt;code&gt;react-router&lt;/code&gt;) and layout of its children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A view can be composed of other views, containers, and components&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A view should not have any custom CSS styles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A view should have integration tests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Containers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The second category of components we have at FullStory are &amp;quot;container&amp;quot; components. We define a &amp;quot;container&amp;quot; as a React component that has the single responsibility of passing data or state (generally fetched asynchronously) to its children. This generally includes things like code splitting, data fetching, or accessing shared UI states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The containers in this image can be represented by the data inside of the grey boxes. The views determined the layout of the grey boxes and now the containers handle retrieval of the data in order to pass it down to its children. No UI is rendered yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Traits of a Container&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We define the traits and rules of a container as the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A container should handle asynchronous actions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A container should handle accessing data and application level UI state or context&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A container can be composed of views, other containers, and components&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A container should not have any custom CSS styles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A container should have integration tests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Components&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The third category of components we have at FullStory are &amp;quot;component&amp;quot;... components. We define a &amp;quot;component&amp;quot; as a React component that has the single responsibility of rendering UI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: “&amp;#x27;component&amp;#x27;... components” Ok, I know that sounds kind of funny. We could call them “PresentationalComponents” or “UIComponents” but we chose to just call them “components” for the sake of brevity.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our components now add another layer to our example image. The views laid out the page and sections of the page, the containers fetched the data or accessed the UI state, and now the components have received that state and rendered the UI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Traits of a Component&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We define the different traits and rules of a component as the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A component should define and render UI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A component should ideally have Storybook* stories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A component can have custom CSS styles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A component should have unit tests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A component should not import and use containers or views (but can render them as children)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: At FullStory, we love using &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://storybook.js.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Storybook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. In the last year we’ve added around 700 new stories as we’ve migrated to React. We have found that when we keep our components singularly purposed, we can take advantage of the power of Storybook by effortlessly rendering our UI components in isolation.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Returning to a Galaxy Far, Far Away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s return the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jcarroll2007/1cb61a6d9742533a3781369a067a43f4#file-starwarscharacters-multipleresponsibilities-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;StarWarsCharacters&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; component example from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bionic.fullstory.com/how-to-create-scalable-testable-and-readable-react-components-part-1/&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;. We previously stated that this component does not have a single responsibility, hardly uses composition, and is not very testable. We will now use our component categories and give three examples of how we can make the &lt;code&gt;StarWarsCharacters&lt;/code&gt; component more scalable, testable, and readable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This screenshot and the following code snippets are from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcarroll2007/react-architecture-example&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Routing for the “create a character” modal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;CharactersView&lt;/code&gt;  defined below uses composition of other views, containers, and components to create the layout of the page. It passes off responsibilities to the other components that compose the page which results in a very small, singularly purposed view component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fetching data and rendering UI based on state&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;CharacterListContainer&lt;/code&gt; defined below fetches the character list data and renders different UI based on the state of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rendering the UI for the list of characters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;CharacterList&lt;/code&gt; component defined below renders other UI components defined in the &lt;code&gt;./styles&lt;/code&gt; file (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://styled-components.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;styled-components&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that define the styles for the list of characters that our users will see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;... and so on.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To see the full breakdown of components check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcarroll2007/react-architecture-example&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By breaking apart the &lt;code&gt;StarWarsCharacters&lt;/code&gt; component into views, containers, and components our code has become much more readable, scalable, and testable. We will elaborate on this in Part 3 of this series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Until next time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve now seen how we can implement components that adhere to the principles of architecture using these three React component categories. In the final part of this series, we will discuss how these component categories positively impact the scalability, testability, and readability of our React code.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[7 guideposts for ecommerce brands in retail’s new normal]]></title><description><![CDATA[Experts share 7 key trends among retailers who have successfully navigated the pandemic’s challenges. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/online-retail-new-normal</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/online-retail-new-normal</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pandemic has dramatically altered how the retail industry operates. For example, McKinsey reported that deliveries increased as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/retail/our%20insights/how%20covid%2019%20is%20changing%20consumer%20behavior%20now%20and%20forever/how-covid-19-is-changing-consumer-behaviornow-and-forever.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;much in two months&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as they had in the previous 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For retailers, that means adapting to new tactics, such as contactless pickup and adjusted in-store experiences, in a matter of weeks, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Essentially, retailers have been forced to throw away the map and navigate by compass to meet customers’ changing needs. Now, nearly two years after the initial onset of the pandemic, the new landscape of retail is beginning to reveal itself. (Spoiler alert: its topography is pretty different.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a recent panel with &lt;a href=&quot;https://partners.fullstory.com/directory/partner/627876/optimizely&quot;&gt;Optimizely&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rightpoint.com/&quot;&gt;Rightpoint&lt;/a&gt;, we asked experts to share key trends and pivots among retailers who have successfully navigated these challenging times. The panelists were: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Myers, Head of Product Marketing at FullStory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lea Howland, Product Evangelist at Optimizely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Bannos, VP, Global Head of CX Strategic Solutions at Rightpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s a summary of the seven guideposts they’ve offered for retail pros in the new normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Acquisition and retention beat win-back strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rightpoint.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rightpoint&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a digital agency, Stephanie Bannos’ team encourages clients to think about re-engaging customers &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; they’re lost—rather than winning them back. The payoff is far lower for win-back strategies than it is for acquisition and retention strategies, she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s the best way to do this? By establishing a culture of experimentation and creating an efficient cycle of turning insights into actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Stephanie also suggests that if you’re having trouble seeing results from your site experiments, you might have an audience/strategy mismatch, and can try switching up how you define customer segments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall, the panel’s recommendation is to &lt;b&gt;work toward an experimentation cycle that’s an always-on part of your digital experience strategy&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Every customer touchpoint should be conversion-ready&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s a well-documented idiom—dating back before social media—that a prospective customer needs an average of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.krusecontrolinc.com/rule-of-7-how-social-media-crushes-old-school-marketing-2021/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;seven encounters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with your brand before they’ll make a purchase. It’s still true, but today, each encounter must also offer the opportunity to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The increase in online shopping—and specifically mobile shopping, which now accounts for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2021/08/27/how-shoppers-are-using-social-media/?sh=34f2f672ebe0&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;73% of online purchases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—has caused many ecommerce pros to focus on each customer touchpoint. Where social media ads were once viewed as brief stops along the omnichannel purchase journey, they’re now a key driver of online sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For ecommerce brands, this means that &lt;b&gt;every&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;point in the omnichannel experience should be conversion-ready&lt;/b&gt;—whether it’s a product page on your website or the link in your Instagram bio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Customer feedback loops should be holistic and instantaneous &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your customers’ shopping needs move quickly. While gathering customer feedback through interviews and surveys is still an important piece of understanding a digital journey, you need a faster, hands-free way to collect customer data as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is where a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool revolutionizes your customer feedback process. The best way to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/feedback-loop-optimization-strategies/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer feedback cycle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s both speedy and holistic is by gathering quantitative experience metrics alongside powerful, qualitative contextual detail. This creates a continuous feedback loop for improving the digital experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;For more about what shoppers are looking for, download our &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-state-of-digital-shopping-2021&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;State of Digital Shopping report&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Balance DX basics with more sophisticated elements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; digital ecommerce experience is user-friendly, free of bugs, and allows your customer to view products and make purchases seamlessly. Those are the basics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;great&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; digital experience has mastered each of the basic elements and incorporates additional, more sophisticated digital experience elements.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, a retailer might have a functional, easy-to-use site experience, with no bells and whistles. Another very similar retailer might have all of those basic elements, with the addition of a chatbot that provides customer experience instantaneously. According to the presenters, if presented with these two options, a shopper is likely to choose the retailer that offers the chat option because they know that will be a better experience if they need support for their order. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Your competitors aren’t your only competition &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your customers are becoming more and more digitally savvy—and more and more able to quickly recognize a subpar online experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Accordingly, &lt;b&gt;in your customers’ eyes, your brand’s digital experience is actually competing with the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;last&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;great&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; digital experience they had&lt;/b&gt;, whether that’s a bank, coffee shop, or clothing store. When it comes to digital experiences, comparing apples and oranges actually works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If a shopper has an excellent experience with a specialty online shoe retailer, and then a dreadful experience with a specialty online sunglasses retailer, the shopper can and will compare the two. As digital experiences progress, customers are becoming more adept at recognizing—and seeking out—excellent ones in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-state-of-digital-shopping-2021/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;online shopping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. The in-store experience has some catching up to do &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pandemic has had major ramifications for online &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; in-store shopping experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Specifically, in-store customers expect retail associates to be able to do anything that the customer can do on the website—from viewing past orders to seeing customer support communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Where a POS system was once all a retail associate needed, they now need an interface that surfaces a customers’ entire interaction history to best serve them in-store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;7. Customers are the real winners &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite the chaos, there’s a happy ending. Ultimately, the changes in the retail industry are benefiting customers in productive ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Offering an excellent digital customer experience has been a best practice for as long as ecommerce has existed, and now it’s becoming a competitive requirement. Retailers are striving to become more customer-centric, to be more thoughtful about the ideal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-to-create-a-customer-journey-map/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer journey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and to encourage customer empathy among their teams—ultimately making customers’ lives easier and creating more delightful online shopping experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Black Friday recap: 3 ecommerce trends we noticed]]></title><description><![CDATA[How did retailers’ Digital Experience Intelligence fare during Black Friday 2021?

The major difference, however, is the slice of that pie that online and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/28/22806233/black-friday-online-spending-decreased-first-time&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;mobile shopping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has claimed since Elmo. In 1996, just 20 million American adults had access to the internet. Today, it’s closer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/topics/2237/internet-usage-in-the-united-states/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;320 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As FullStory helps brands of all sizes understand their users’ digital experiences to optimize what’s successful and eliminate friction, we can track high-level trends from the noise of  global shopper behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Based on hundreds of thousands of site visits, our team noticed three trends—plus some tips you can put into practice today to help your business succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s more ecommerce traffic than ever&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/scott-galloways-four-stats-on-the-future-of-e-commerce/43808&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Scott Galloway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, professor of marketing at NYU, described in a recent webinar how the pandemic overhauled the world of commerce:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Since 2009, the percentage of retail done on digital channels has gone up one percent each year. And as of 2020 it was at 18%, and then in eight weeks it went to 28%. We had a decade in eight weeks.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/05/business/economy/supply-chain.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a stumbling supply chain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and record demand for products delivered prominently through an ecommerce platform, it’s no surprise that there is more online ecommerce traffic than ever– and this year’s Black Friday is a clear example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In plain English, there are more people shopping online than ever before, and they’re visiting more pages in the process. &lt;b&gt;Across all companies who use FullStory’s Digital Experience Intelligence platform, we saw an increase in logged session volume.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This steadily increased in the weeks preceding Black Friday and Cyber Monday and reached a peak the weekend following Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What that means for you: &lt;/b&gt;More people visiting your site means higher stakes for user experience. The greater scrutiny you place on your website or mobile app’s UX—and the more qualitative and quantitative data you can gather from your site’s visitors—the stronger your ecommerce engine will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Shoppers spent more time on retail sites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not only did more people visit websites, but the length of time they stayed on those websites increased on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is in line with FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-state-of-digital-shopping-2021/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent survey of 1,600+ online shoppers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where 90% of consumers noted plans to shop online the same or more compared to last year’s holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why the jump in session length? There’s a high likelihood that it’s related to proven tactics like flash deals, clearance sales, and other methods of enticing shoppers. When businesses use these offers, shoppers tend to stick around websites for longer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;56% of &lt;a href=&quot;http://socialmarketingfella.com/daily-deals-flash-sales-stats-need-know/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;businesses have higher click-to-open rates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from flash sale emails compared to their yearly rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flash sales &lt;a href=&quot;http://socialmarketingfella.com/daily-deals-flash-sales-stats-need-know/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;generate an average 35% lift &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in transaction rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2012, when J.C. Penney &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.priceintelligently.com/blog/bid/152018/lessons-from-the-failure-of-j-c-penney-s-new-pricing-strategy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;stopped promoting sales and coupons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, their profits &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/27/business/jcpenney-history/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;sunk 25%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What that means for you: &lt;/b&gt;Traffic influxes are an incredible opportunity for experimentation. When more people visit your site in a small window of time, create A/B tests or conduct conversion experiments—you’ll reach statistical significance for tests faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;More traffic doesn’t have to mean more annoyances&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Issues like Dead Clicks and Error Clicks increased as the number of sessions increased–but not at the exact same rate.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When session volume increased, these important &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/finding-dxi-signals-through-the-noise/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory signals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; signals rose, but at a lower rate—a 150% to 200% increase in Dead Clicks and Error Clicks, compared to a 200% to 300% increase in sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Connecting some dots, this indicates that FullStory’s DXI solution is helping shoppers from having frustrated sessions, even as they do more shopping—and online retailers see billions in sales in just a few hours.

By marrying Digital Experience Intelligence with Google Optimize, you can keep a close eye on the digital customer experience and create an ongoing improvement process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’re going to take a deeper look into these tools, how they work together, and how you can use them to improve your website’s results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is Google Optimize?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://optimize.google.com/optimize/home/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Optimize&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/DXI-fullstory-google-analytics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suite, and is a solution for running experiments on websites and customizing content for different audiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The goal of Google Optimize is to enhance the user experience by testing different variables on a website to identify which drive the best results. Google Analytics is able to supply some, but not all, of the test result data—which is why Google Optimize is necessary for filling in the gaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/ab-testing-digital-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get five quick tips for A/B testing to improve the digital experience in this blog.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google Optimize features include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrations with &lt;a href=&quot;https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tagmanager.google.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Tag Manager&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ability to build new variables with Google Optimize’s on-page visual editor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improvement-tracking metrics, along with built-in probability and confidence calculations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ability to conduct a single A/B test or multivariate test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What you can accomplish with Google Optimize&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With Google Optimize, you can manipulate and rearrange images, text, and content, as well as substitute different calls-to-action (CTAs) and layouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are some examples of elements you can alter and test with Google Optimize:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personalized CTAs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logo size and position&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page colors and backgrounds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Element descriptions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For instance, you might create several versions of a page with different element variations, and designate which version should be shown to different types of users. Each user’s interactions with their prescribed site version will be logged, allowing you to evaluate which version elicits the most conversions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A simpler test might be to conduct an &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;A/B test&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where one group of visitors sees the A version of your site and the second group sees the B version. Then, based on which version converts at the highest rate, you can narrow your experiment and test the elements within that version. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your goal is to use these changes to evaluate their effects on your site’s user engagement, eventually improving your user experience with permanent changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Though a powerful tool, Google Optimize isn’t able to reveal the actual experience visitors are having while navigating your website—which is why it’s best when combined with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-intelligence/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What you can accomplish with Digital Experience Intelligence &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google Optimize can tell you a lot about which elements on your site influence conversions, but it can’t give you complete digital experience data and the ability to see recreations of users navigating your site. However, when you integrate Google Optimize with a DXI solution, you can see which tests are successful&lt;i&gt; and why.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dxi-session-replay/&quot;&gt;Session replay&lt;/a&gt;—a key feature of DXI—elevates traditional web analytics and testing tools by showing a complete picture of the user on a website or app. Replays provide all the individual data points you get with a typical analytics tool, and insights to how those data points combine to create an experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In other words, session replay helps you see your site through your customers’ eyes to understand where they’re encountering friction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How the two work together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s a scenario that illustrates how these tools can work together to achieve powerful results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A designer at a SaaS company wants to enhance an existing website design, but is struggling to predict which changes will improve conversion rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The designer hypothesizes that rearranging the page’s layout would increase engagement and, in turn, convert more sales for the business. This hypothesis seemed simple, but one thing was holding her back—data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, she enlisted Google Optimize and FullStory’s best-in-class Digital Experience Intelligence solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The designer used Google Optimize to divide her visitors between two versions of the page. And while Google Optimize allowed her to easily split the audience, the insights and data it provided on the design weren’t as robust as she wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To fill in the gaps, she used FullStory’s DXI solution to create event funnels and record user sessions on both versions of the page. The designer could then segment the visitors on each version and create funnels to reveal how many people clicked through and ultimately converted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The designer was able to replay the sessions of any user to discover why they were or were not advancing in the funnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By using both Google Optimize and DXI, the designer was able to achieve clear results. The new version of the page received significantly higher engagement and conversion, which informed the designer of which permanent changes to make to the site. Without both tools, uncovering these optimizations would have been much more difficult and time consuming for the designer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to create a customer journey map]]></title><description><![CDATA[Map out how your customers navigate your website or app—and determine where you need to improve. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-to-create-a-customer-journey-map</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-to-create-a-customer-journey-map</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Education Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer journey mapping is a powerful way to understand your customers—what their needs are, their motivations, and their frustrations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In fact, one of the best storytelling tools is the customer journey map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://fullstory.com/customer-journey-maps/&quot;&gt;customer journey map&lt;/a&gt; (CJM) uses storytelling to illustrate the relationship a customer has with a product or service over time.

Your customer journey maps out the areas you can improve, retain and scale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When should you create a customer journey map?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Timing is important when it comes to customer journey mapping. Journey maps are typically generated early on in the research phase and should be created to support a known business goal. Maps that align with particular goals usually result in applicable insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Examples of potential goals to apply journey maps to: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting a business perspective from inside-out to outside-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assigning ownership of key touchpoints in the customer experience to specific departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning about a specific customer persona&amp;#x27;s purchasing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding user trends of group personas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to create a customer journey map&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you set out to create your own journey map, try drawing everything out on a whiteboard or digitizing it on a spreadsheet to get the big picture. The goal is to find and resolve any customer pain points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are eight steps to creating your own customer journey map. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 1: Set your objectives for the map&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before the whiteboard comes out, it’s important to set up clear objectives for the map. How do you do this? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Collect customer feedback from all company stakeholders, your team, and your customers. You can do this by forms, surveys, interviews, spotlights, or good old-fashioned conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ask questions like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you feel about this feature? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How easy was it to find us? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were there any points of frustration during your interaction with us? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Set goals within the customer journey map like seeing your product through your customer’s eyes, ways to improve your product or service, and how it all impacts your future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 2. Define your customer persona&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your customer is the core of your journey map, so the first step is defining your target customer persona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A customer or &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;buyer persona&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an in-depth understanding of who your customer really is, what they are trying to solve, and how they interact with your business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first thing you need to decide is which type of journey you’re going to map:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Persona&lt;/b&gt;—a profile of a specific customer type &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Target&lt;/b&gt;—a profile of a potential customer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Market&lt;/b&gt;—a segment of customers &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re creating your first map, it&amp;#x27;s best to pick your most common customer persona and consider the route they would typically take when engaging with your business for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From the point of interest to the product lifeline, track each step along the way to get a true sense of your target persona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you&amp;#x27;ve created distinct personas, you can use them to dictate customer journey maps that describe each persona&amp;#x27;s experience at various points during their lifecycle with your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 3: Highlight your target customer personas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Take your journey map persona list and pinpoint your target customer. To do this, dig deep and understand what each customer wants to achieve as they go through the customer journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A great way to go about doing this is to first identify the paths that your customer may take on your site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For instance, if your customer is a member, the first thing that they might do is to log in. These instances will help you determine engagement for each customer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are some different ways to obtain and understand customers&amp;#x27; goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Survey or interview different customer groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conduct &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usertesting.com/blog/collecting-customer-feedback-remotely&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;user testing feedback&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.fullstory.com/courses/fullstory-for-customer-support&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer support&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; correspondence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With this insight, you can then determine where your customer will go along their journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 4. Determine customer stages&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Journey maps are organized by customer stages (sometimes referred to as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commbox.io/the-5-phases-of-the-customer-journey-when-onboarding-a-guide/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;phases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each stage represents a goal your customer is trying to achieve in their journey. You should build a customer journey map with stages that represent your customer&amp;#x27;s goal-oriented journey, not your internal process steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Based on the persona, define the stages that your customer experiences with you over time. To figure out your stages, answer this question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What does it take for a customer to start from awareness to decision throughout the buying process? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The typical &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxpressia.com/blog/how-to-define-stages-journey-maps&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer journey map stages&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Awareness&lt;/b&gt;—how they found out about you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research&lt;/b&gt;—how you can solve their problem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evaluation&lt;/b&gt;—how you compare against others &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decision&lt;/b&gt;—how they chose you &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The goal&lt;/b&gt;: to determine how, when, and where they discover you, choose you over competitors, purchase from you, and maintain a relationship with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 5. Identify customer touchpoints&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your buyer journey map will be built off of customer touchpoints. Customer touchpoints are your brand&amp;#x27;s points of customer contact, from start to finish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, here are a few ways customers may find you: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search inquiry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media post &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These are just a few touchpoints, there are many more. Identifying these customer touchpoints is an important step towards creating a journey map and making sure your customers are satisfied every step of the way. It’s also the pivotal part of how you will define your map. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 6. Map the current state &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s time to conduct customer research for your map. This will include information about your customer’s intentions, motivations, digital footprint, and interpretation of your brand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most customers are happy to help if they believe you are genuinely interested in their experience and will use their feedback to improve things for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For each stage of the journey, try to identify:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are my customer’s goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What type of experience do they want?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What steps are needed to complete that process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do they feel during each touchpoint?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What other thoughts, feelings or frustrations do they have during certain stages?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Beyond this information, be sure to look at patterns of how they conduct themselves online, where they frequent, and what they share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 7. Understand motivations, frustrations, and resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This step involves looking at the totality of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/experience-management/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer experience (CX)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with your company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every business will look through the lens of its customer personas uniquely. Walking through each of the journey map stages with your team will help you identify any points of friction within the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You know your customers best. Here are a few example questions to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where could friction appear in this particular touchpoint?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are people abandoning purchases because of this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are customers unaware of this solution that you&amp;#x27;ve provided? If so, why not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These questions can be answered with customer data, using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (DXI) solution. DXI delivers a complete, retroactive view of how people interact with your site or app. By finding out how visitors engage with your product and service, you can understand what resources you will need for growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examine customer emotions and motivations.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every action your customer takes is motivated by emotion. The emotional driver of each of your customer&amp;#x27;s actions is usually caused by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commbox.io/the-complete-guide-to-customer-pain-points/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;pain point&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, get to know what roadblocks are stopping customers from making desired actions (again with digital intelligence) and get in front of motivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overcome obstacles like cost, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/fixing-product-friction-at-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;product friction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and onboarding frustration with customer experience intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take the customer journey yourself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Follow the customer journey yourself. Analyze the results to show where customer needs aren’t being met by seeing it through your customer’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pro tip: Document the customer journey for each of your personas and make note of the differences. It will help for future user journey maps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Determine the resources you have and the ones you&amp;#x27;ll need.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s important to take inventory of the resources you have and the ones you&amp;#x27;ll need to improve the customer&amp;#x27;s journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using your map, you can advise leadership to invest in the right tools that will help your team manage customer demand. Do you have what it takes to solve the customer’s problem? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 8: Evaluate, adjust and scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As with any process, you’ll need to test it over time. Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/funnel-analysis-for-digital-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;data analysis to identify customers’ behavior&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and pain points that need changing along the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use digital experience and customer intelligence to keep you informed on the user journey. This means, rely on a DXI solution to let your customers show you what’s actually happening. With features like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/review-user-sessions/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can understand exactly what they are going through and proactively fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And, always include your team and keep stakeholders involved to keep the roadmap clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer journey mapping tools&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You’ll need some tools to help you get started and to maintain your customer journey maps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the core, a customer journey map is a visual representation of the steps a user takes to complete a goal with your products. The process is typically illustrated through a series of steps, complete with three basic components including the lens, the experience, and the insights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lens&lt;/b&gt;—An overview of tasks and what needs to be accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Experience&lt;/b&gt;—A visualization of the steps of the journey, including the customer’s emotional states at each step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insights&lt;/b&gt;—The actionable takeaways from each step in the journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;An effective map creates a shared sense of where each aspect of the product or service should be improved across your organization—especially where each step of the process might be owned by a different team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Good customer journey mapping tools help you create polished visual assets you can use to advocate for the customer’s needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are plenty of tools available to help map out your customer journey, here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://uxpressia.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;UXPressia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—Professional, collaborative customer journey mapping tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://miro.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Miro&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—Online collaborative whiteboard platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smaply.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Smaply&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—Create, share, and present customer journey maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—Full dashboard of website analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—Data intelligence, heatmap and web analytics platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hotjar.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;HotJar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—Website heatmaps and behavior analytics tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer journey mapping and your team&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you&amp;#x27;ve decided on your goals for creating a customer journey map, pull in your team cross-functionally to create the map. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The reason being is that different departments engage with customers uniquely and they can provide significant pieces of the map that you would likely not find on your own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your team should be on board for customer journey mapping, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leadership&lt;/b&gt;—executes the journey map decisions and resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product&lt;/b&gt;—creates and implements the actionable insights from the journey map. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer Success&lt;/b&gt;—obtains and explains the customer journey map results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sales and Marketing&lt;/b&gt;—creates and executes the customer journey map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data Analyst&lt;/b&gt;—analyzes and interprets the results of the map.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your customer journey map checklist &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This guide on how to create a customer journey map should be what you need to truly understand the impact of your product or service. By stepping into your customer’s shoes, you will gain the insight needed to make the entire experience better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now you’re ready to create your map. Here are the questions you will ask yourself while creating a customer journey map:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;☑ Set clear objectives for your map
☑ Define your customer persona
☑ Highlight your target personas
☑ Determine customer stages 
☑ Identify customer touchpoints
☑ Map the current state 
☑ Understand motivations, frustrations, and what tools you’ll need 
☑ Evaluate, adjust and get ready to grow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a best-in-class &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-intelligence/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DXI solution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like FullStory, you can watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replays&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/heatmap/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;heatmaps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/graph-monthly-weekly-and-daily-active-user-trends-by-behavior-user-attribute/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;user trends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to really fine-tune your customer’s journey. You don’t have to go in blind trying to understand what they are feeling or experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use the data and let your customers do the rest. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wherefore art thou, usability testing?]]></title><description><![CDATA[User testers for hire lack the intrinsic motivations of real, actual users.

When you have skin in the game, failure is going to cost you. Like Antonio, you have a vested interest in success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of course, it&amp;#x27;s not the 16th century, and usability testing isn&amp;#x27;t Shakespeare. Your test subjects aren&amp;#x27;t asked to pony up such high stakes, or, really, any stakes at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Therein lies a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But, wait. What is usability testing, anyway?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Usability testing helps teams understand how a product or service might be used through having a representative set of users interact with the product or service to complete some specific task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As users complete tasks, user experience researchers observe and assess how easy it is for tasks to be completed. Usability testing is important because it helps identify areas of weakness, confusion, or other friction that would drive users to leave your site. As Jakob Nielsen put it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Web, usability is a necessary condition for survival. If a website is difficult to use, people &lt;b&gt;leave&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/&quot;&gt;Jakob Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Website owners and app developers turn to usability testing to make sure users &lt;i&gt;stay.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why traditional usability testing just doesn&amp;#x27;t cut it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every product manager would agree that they would love to conduct user testing with people who truly need and want to use their product, but finding these people is much easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You&amp;#x27;re so focused on building the product that you don&amp;#x27;t have the time or resources to identify and coordinate test users. So perhaps you hire a third-party recruiter, give them all the information you can, including demographics and customer traits, and send them off to find user testers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But that introduces new problems to the mix. Consider how these third party companies find their testers. They turn to a database of users who signed up to be on a list, very likely because they enjoy making extra money testing products in their free time. These are semi-professional user testers who primarily want to get on the panel and will tell the recruiter what they want to hear. Like it or not, the motivation of these testers is first and foremost a paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a result, they are almost certainly &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; your ideal customers. At best, these user testers only have an artificial interest in your product or service. They just don&amp;#x27;t have any skin in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Testing the users without skin in the game will taint your results. So what are you to do? Is there no alternative to usability testing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to test users with skin in the game&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finding test subjects with a true desire to use your product is a difficult challenge. So instead of you trying to identify and find them out in the world, what if you could just test them after they find you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With replay, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;playback sessions of actual customers&lt;/a&gt; as they use your product to get an accurate idea of what&amp;#x27;s working—or not. Why? Because these users are real. &lt;b&gt;They have skin in the game,&lt;/b&gt; an actual need to fulfill, actual concerns that constrain their experience, and something real at stake if your product doesn&amp;#x27;t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The motives of real users are natural. They&amp;#x27;re coming to your product or service because they have a genuine need. They are intrinsically motivated to navigate through your site or app, as required, to help them accomplish what they want to do. If they hit a barrier, they become frustrated and will try another way. This type of &lt;i&gt;organic user behavior&lt;/i&gt; by a &lt;i&gt;motivated subject&lt;/i&gt; is impossible to capture in a controlled experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session replay also captures real customers experiencing your product in their own environment. When you play back their experiences, these users are on their own devices, unencumbered by user testing software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most importantly, if (and when) users fail to achieve their objectives, as Jakob Nielsen pointed pointed out, they &lt;b&gt;leave&lt;/b&gt;—but not before the tape (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt;) records their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/&quot;&gt;moments of frustration online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Test the right users to deliver the right results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t make the mistake of tweaking your site or app based on the needs of artificially incentivized paid user testers. To glean insights that will unlock your product&amp;#x27;s full potential, reveal new ways to exceed your customers&amp;#x27; expectations, and fuel your company&amp;#x27;s growth, you have to learn from users who are actual users your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider using FullStory as an intuitive, cost-effective, &lt;i&gt;natural&lt;/i&gt; usability testing research method. It&amp;#x27;ll help you capture user behaviors from actual customer experiences and leave the crapshoot of traditional user testing behind once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Afterward:&lt;/i&gt; In addition to the structural challenges presented by user testing, there are other problems with testing in a lab setting.

These experiences are made worse because anyone using your knowledge base necessarily fails to understand some aspect of your product, whether it&amp;#x27;s how to use it, what it does, or how to troubleshoot a particular problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because help center users are &lt;i&gt;customers&lt;/i&gt; the stakes are high—when customers can&amp;#x27;t figure out how to use your product they aren&amp;#x27;t likely to &lt;i&gt;stay&lt;/i&gt; your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/ecommerce/&quot;&gt;E-commerce&lt;/a&gt; platform &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; is taking a proactive approach to improving the UX on their Help Center, ensuring Shopify users get the answers they need. In particular, they use FullStory to understand how users look for answers and run experiments to optimize the experience further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We spoke with Lina on the knowledge management team and Rob on the documentation team to learn how they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;using session replay&lt;/a&gt; to improve their knowledge base for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rob and Lina shared how FullStory surfaced opportunities to improve the help center&amp;#x27;s search functionality, fill in missing context around user feedback, and improve the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Making knowledge base search work for users&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One of Lina&amp;#x27;s tasks on Shopify&amp;#x27;s Knowledge Management team was to find low-hanging fruit—opportunities for dramatic improvements to the functionality of the help center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They knew the search functionality for the Shopify Help Center could be improved, so they turned to FullStory to research sessions in which users engaged with search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Replaying those sessions led to a handful of observations that drove immediate improvements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Users commonly searched using questions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E.g. “What can I sell on Shopify?” To answer these types of questions, the team created pages to supplement the content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Users searched for pages that fit logically within multiple sections of the site. &lt;/b&gt;Shopify handled this problem through creating search filters to allow users to search for pages within specific sections of the Help Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By observing specific search terms used during FullStory recordings, the team learned the key words most commonly used to search for content.&lt;/b&gt; With these insights, Shopify was able to add synonyms ensuring all relevant results were displayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FullStory surfaced sessions that contained multiple searches from single users.&lt;/b&gt; Watching these sessions was particularly helpful in identifying both searches with no result—revealing gaps in the knowledge base—&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; teasing out the final search that yielded the answer sought by the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In each case above, FullStory was used to identify ways to surface existing content more efficiently to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From ambiguous user feedback to actionable insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the bottom of each article, Help Center users can react to the article and optionally provide feedback:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While this is useful for surfacing article problems, what&amp;#x27;s often missing is the necessary context to know just what is going wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lina and Rob use FullStory session recordings to dig into these reports in order to see if they can understand why the user left the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lessons learned from erratic scrolling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In one example while replaying sessions from users who left negative feedback on a particularly long piece of content, Lina and Rob saw a common theme of frantic scrolling.

You are always looking for opportunities to drive more engagement to make your products stickier, easier to use, and more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When looking for ways to improve and get results in your workflow, turn to this repeatable habit: &lt;b&gt;Search, Learn, Act, Report, Repeat.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is SLARR?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simply put, SLARR is a five-step looping workflow of habits that product managers can use to optimize their products.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Search&lt;/b&gt;: Conduct in-depth research on a segment of customers to measure behavior. This is to understand where to focus attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn&lt;/b&gt;: Analyze results. Once there’s got enough data, form a hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Act&lt;/b&gt;: Take action based on the hypothesis. This could be as simple as experimenting with a change or as big as launching a new feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Report&lt;/b&gt;: Apply the results to business goals, and adjust according to the results of actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Repeat&lt;/b&gt;: Keep repeating this process to improve product and customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Simply put, the more this habit is put into use, the more products improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What are some example scenarios of SLARR?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
To help make sense of the SLARR loop, here are some scenarios product teams frequently encounter, each broken down into the simple steps of SLARR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running a Beta Program&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;QA Testing a New Feature&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving Awareness for a New Feature&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving Adoption of a Critical Feature or Workflow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep reading for more info on each:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Try this at home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The SLARR habit was created to make digital products better, no matter the department of your organization—even outside of product management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Marketers can use SLARR to optimize for conversions. Sales teams can experiment with new cadences or content to drive more meaningful conversations. Support can test new technical documentation and tools to reduce friction in the service experience. Engineers can tinker with ways to reduce processing costs or make systems more stable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What&amp;#x27;s important is to embrace a habit of learning, experimenting, and taking action. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a best-in-class DXI solution like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the SLARR process can become second nature. Together, the powerful combination of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;qualitative data&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt; (instant empathy and motivation) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantitative data&lt;/a&gt; (assurance for people who care about potential impacts) can help get teams on board to make impactful, profitable changes.

You make a note of the complaints and move onto more pressing matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On Tuesday you see a few more complaints that are similar to those you received Monday. Worse, the customers complaining are getting more and more annoyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Come Friday, the complaints have really piled up. You’ve seen and heard enough to know you’ve got a bug that needs to be fixed ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Buckle up because this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you want to get the bug fixed, you’re going to need to convince your product manager (PM) to make it a priority. That’s going to require you put on your best smile, bring data to support your case, and *help your PM empathize &lt;i&gt;with the customer’s plight&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;Quantitative + Qualitative Data&lt;/a&gt; go better together.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Making a compelling case to your PM will speak to both the head and the heart. And the user insights FullStory helps you uncover (plus a dash of reckoning on your part) will help you do both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s start with &lt;i&gt;quantifying&lt;/i&gt; the problem. Take a look at the numbers!&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Present your PM with data around how many people are experiencing the problem. FullStory can help you pull the affected segment, and you can use a Searchie to visualize trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next, take a back-of-the-envelope stab at &lt;i&gt;quantifying the impact of the bug&lt;/i&gt;—on conversions, engagement, and/or whatever hard metric you can think of to demonstrate impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Don’t be afraid to use estimates if you don’t know the exact figures. The purpose in assigning numerical values to the bug is to generate discussion and help the PM to triage importance relative to other priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, let’s talk about the &lt;i&gt;qualitative&lt;/i&gt;. Queue empathy!&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s no better way to help your PM understand customers’ experiences than actually showing them what’s happening. Here, FullStory’s ability to create empathy for users really shines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay&quot;&gt;FullStory’s session replay&lt;/a&gt;, you can return to the session of any user and replay exactly what their experience was. This is a powerful way to spur an empathetic response from your PM, communicating frustration in a way that goes beyond raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory’s session replay features also help PMs track exactly what chain of events led to the bug. It’s easy to see how users are running into problems and mark exactly where in a session they encountered the bug in question. Additionally, FullStory playback allows you to pull up the JavaScript console so you can see the error that is being triggered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reproducing bugs becomes that much easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, you can leave notes in sessions to provide context and stats (such as volume of requests and time users have spent stuck on a bug) right alongside the session playback to further help your PM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data in combination with the power of empathy come together to make your PM’s job much easier in assessing whether or not the bug needs to get fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Combat Recency Bias with Empathetic Distance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you’re in the middle of a case and you feel a customer’s pain, you might feel a strong urge to interrupt the PM and engineering team and see if they can fix the bug &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;. By all means, if your product is on fire and customers are suffering, raise the alarm and put out the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For less urgent matters, consider putting empathetic distance between you and the individual customer cases. What is “empathetic distance?” It’s putting time between when you first document the bug and when you report it to the product team. This is probably a hair longer than taking a deep breath and counting to ten but it could be as little as “sleeping on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Putting time between the customer case and when you raise it to the attention of the product team helps balance out our innate tendency toward recency bias. Empathetic distance will help you to prioritize the changes which will have the most impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reviewing bugs at a regular cadence is a great way to create empathetic distance, which in turn helps in figuring out what to prioritize. For example, you might have a bug review with support, product, and QA every Monday afternoon to look at what came up over the past week. A regular bug review cadence also helps you triage what should be fixed as you’ll be able to review multiple issues &lt;i&gt;at the same time&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And if the bug doesn’t get fixed …&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No matter how convincing your case may be, not all bugs you bring to your PM’s attention are going to get fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When a bug gets passed over, close the loop with your customers. Your customers will thank you for honest communication.

Show customers you care, and they’ll be excited to hear from you again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Don’t beat around the bush. Be straightforward in your communication. Let them know you aren’t going to fix the problem and demonstrate that you care about their experience by offering your continued support. While it’s not what they necessarily want to hear, knowing their issue was addressed goes a long way to show appreciation for their commitment to your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let us know how &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; escalate and handle bugs!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How are you handling bugs at your organization?

Answering these questions can go a long way in helping marketing, sales, product development, and support teams identify the ups and downs of customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yet creating customer journey maps is tricky because they require the marketing and product team to step out of your day-to-day perspective and see through the eyes of the customer — and not through the lens of the amazing features, marketing campaigns, knowledge base articles, or the sales pitches they create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Connecting customer journey mapping and empathy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A customer journey map (sometimes referred to as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customer-journey-maps&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;user journey map&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) begins with understanding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cmswire.com/digital-marketing/how-to-create-customer-personas/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer persona&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the very first touchpoint. It then follows that persona on their journey from onboarding and throughout the lifetime usage of the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Think of customer journey maps as stories. The main characters  are customers. The map is the magical journey the customer takes. Note the “customer” is not just a singular persona, personas are an amalgamation of a certain type of customer and there will be different maps for different personas. For instance, the map for a technical user might be different than a casual enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Just like stories, the details matter to a customer journey map. Capturing everything about the user experience and reflecting on it puts yourself in the shoes of the customer. Ask these questions:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the experience make you feel? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What questions arise? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What changes would you make? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As these parts of the map are fleshed out, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/desire-paths-digital-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;opportunities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will arise to make the experience better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The opportunities happening are derived from empathy: customer journey maps are empathy generators that humanize the user. Customer journey maps are empathy paths. They show you things from the customer&amp;#x27;s perspective—through the customer&amp;#x27;s eyes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When product developers, designers, marketers, and customer support professionals start to identify empathetically with the customer through a customer journey map, they suddenly need to make the customer experience better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using Digital Experience Intelligence to map out your customer journey &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What if the empathetic benefits of customer journey maps were on-demand? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) solution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like FullStory captures interactions a customer has on your website or app to provide insight for teams across job functions to understand user behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The enormous set of data collected is what powers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to recreate a specific user’s experience on your website or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/dxi-for-mobile-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;native mobile app&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Watching the raw experience of a real customer interacting with your product instantly generates the empathy needed to build out the customer journey map. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And, just like customer journey maps, session replay can reveal opportunities across job functions in marketing, design, sales, customer support, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/engineers-guide-dxi/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Putting the power of personas to work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The key difference between a digital experience intelligence feature like session replay and a customer journey map is that the former is based on individuals — real customers and not personas. When you watch a session replay, it’s the raw truth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what do you do when &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624074-Page-Insights-User-Guide&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;aggregated views&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the customer are required? Personas are useful — they distill the many thousands of actual users into aggregated characters whether that be the causal user or the savvy tech. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Users help build personas by using the search functionality in DXI tools such as FullStory. Mine customer experiences based on the persona criteria in which you’re most interested. Search users based on their persona-signaling behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you suspect that the savvy tech user is going to spend time understanding the nitty-gritty details of the product, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828993-Segment&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;build a segment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in FullStory based on users who interact with that content. Just search based on the behavior—clicks, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/scroll-maps/&quot;&gt;scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/heatmap/&quot;&gt;heatmaps&lt;/a&gt;—to determine the next actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch sessions, take notes, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828513&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;collaborate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with your team to determine those actions, which builds out personas. Your customer journey maps will be that much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further reading: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/heatmap-examples/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;8 website heatmap examples to better your bottom line&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rewrite the map for a better customer experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your team already has a process for customer journey mapping, session replay can make it more empathy-inducing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How? Session replay reinvigorates an existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/how-to-build-a-customer-journey-map/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer journey mapping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; process because it allows teams to test hypotheses, refine assumptions based on new discoveries, and build additional nuance into maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using session replay to complement, supplement, or stand-in for customer journey maps is a great way to tap into that magical empathy on-demand. Perhaps the best thing about session replay is that it can be accessed by teams across an organization, allowing each job function to focus on the specific part of the customer journey map that they want to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mapping your users’ journeys is about knowledge of who they are, what they want, and how they operate. When you have a tool that enables you to see a customer’s experience through their eyes — quite literally, as you get with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DXI solution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like FullStory— that’s a powerful addition to your process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[FullStory boosts support team efficiency 57%]]></title><description><![CDATA[By adopting FullStory, a growing finance company significantly boosts support team efficiency and uses data to make product roadmap decisions.

As it turns out, we can’t mention them by name in this article. But that doesn’t make their story any less impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep reading to learn the quick story of John, the member services manager for a high-tech payments company, and his experiences moving his team to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (DXI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Spoiler alert: his support team got 57% more efficient at their work from FullStory!)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;When the right tool aligns with the right team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As the member services manager for a high-tech payments company, John’s job blends process improvement, quality control, and collaboration with the executive team, along with the day-to-day duties of a support agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When John discovered that his team was struggling to understand customers’ indecipherable questions or comments, he started looking for tools that would help them understand &lt;i&gt;what exactly the customer had been doing&lt;/i&gt; before they wrote in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In essence, John knew the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;quantitative&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—people were struggling with certain aspects of his company’s website. He wanted to know the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;qualitative&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;John notes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We were giving our customers basic troubleshooting instructions like, ‘Can you please provide me a screenshot of your issue,’ to which our customers would respond, ‘I don’t know how to do that.’”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For a company of his size—and one that prides itself on its efficient technology—something had to pivot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;John’s predecessor advised him to use a traditional analytics application, but it wasn’t quite the right tool for the job:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The information was just dots and lines. I’m not a developer and don’t know what all these events map to. It wasn’t what we needed in the support channel. We needed something visual.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
John found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/DXI-fullstory-google-analytics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DXI solution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the perfect tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;One-touch resolutions increased by 57%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After discovering FullStory, John realized his team could capture his customers’ experiences without having them download any tools or take any screenshots. What more, he could also &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.fullstory.com/integrate-ref/olark&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;easily integrate FullStory with Olark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his team’s in-app chat software of choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Once FullStory was implemented, &lt;b&gt;the support team saw their number of one-touch resolutions — tickets solved with a single response — rise from around 50% to &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;88%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Such a dramatic increase in efficiency doesn’t just mean improved customer satisfaction (customers don’t want long back-and-forth email chains just to have their problems solved), it means &lt;b&gt;time saved by support reps and&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;more customers helped&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solve issues with evidence, not assumptions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When key stakeholders at John’s high-tech payments company request customer support metrics—even on a weekly basis—John is happy to provide them, particularly when they’re showing positive trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But simplistic, quantitative line graphs can paint over nuanced details — like the individual customer experience issues that can only be surfaced by the support team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;“An important design or engineering issue may not yet have been brought up by another team — just because they haven’t noticed it yet or because they may be testing in a particular way that didn’t take into consideration this other usage case that the customers found on their own.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In one case, John’s support team noticed a large segment of customers who unsuccessfully attempted to add a card to the payment system. In conversations with the product team, the working assumption was that those customers were simply entering their info incorrectly. Or the card was failing to validate on the bank’s side. These assumptions left the product team at a loss for what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But with FullStory, John’s team didn’t need to rely on assumptions. Looking at FullStory session playback, John discovered that the working assumptions were incorrect: “In reality, our users weren’t seeing the blue, left-hand Submit button and were instead clicking the right-hand button to close the drawer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Armed with evidence — video cases through FullStory plus issues reported weekly — John was able to easily convince the design team to make a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Qualitative plus quantitative equals effectiveness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Significant efficiency gains for their support team &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; evidence-based product management are but two of the benefits John realized at his company once FullStory was put to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ready to learn more?

Though very different, both types are highly valuable in understanding the digital customer experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, we’re focusing on the importance of qualitative data—the different types, examples, and why it’s important to your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The definition of qualitative data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data, also called categorical data, is used to categorize something in a descriptive, expressive way, rather than through numerical values. Simply put, it’s information about an object or subject that you can see or feel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Generally, qualitative analysis is used by market researchers and statisticians to understand behaviors. For business, it’s commonly used by data analysts to understand and interpret customer and user behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can turn to qualitative data to answer the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; behind an action. It’s often used to investigate open-ended studies, allowing participants (or customers) to show their true feelings and actions without guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data includes traits such as how a customer feels about a product or service and what they are motivated by. It’s excellent in understanding the motivations behind customer experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are many ways to gather qualitative data, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research and observation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys or questionnaires&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus groups, online forums, or communities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These types of qualitative research methods are often expressed using studies, pie charts, or graphs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The importance of qualitative data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At a high level, qualitative data analysis provides data analysts a way to identify trends in the world around them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For online businesses, qualitative data can be used to identify the particular frequency of traits or characteristics in customers, users, or website visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data can also help businesses understand their consumers’ language and address problems effectively and efficiently, which is priceless when you’re trying to scale and grow a company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative (categorical) vs. quantitative data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before we get into types and examples, here’s a quick breakdown of the differences between qualitative and quantitative data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data is observational and descriptive, while quantitative data is numerical and measurable. Data analysts often use qualitative and quantitative data together when conducting studies or analyses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to data research, you’ll need different collection, hypotheses, and analysis methods, so it’s important to understand the key &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/#difference-between-quantitative-and-qualitative-data&quot;&gt;differences between quantitative and qualitative data&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quantitative data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numbers-based, countable, or measurable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tells us how many, how much, or how often in calculations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzed using statistical analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Qualitative data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation-based, descriptive, and relating to language&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand why, how, or what happened behind certain behaviors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzed by grouping the data into categories and themes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Types of qualitative data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As we narrow down the importance of qualitative data, you should understand that there are different types. Data analysts often categorize qualitative data into three types:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Binary data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techopedia.com/definition/17929/binary-data&quot;&gt;Binary data&lt;/a&gt; is represented or displayed in the binary numeral system and is numerically represented by a combination of zeros and ones—much like coding on a computer. In fact, binary data is the only category of data that can be directly understood and executed by a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Researchers use binary data to create statistical models that predict how often the study subject is likely to be positive or negative, up or down, right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Nominal data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.formpl.us/blog/nominal-ordinal-data&quot;&gt;Nominal data&lt;/a&gt;, also called “named” or “labeled data,” or a “nominal scale,” is any type of data used to label something &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; giving it a numerical value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data analysts use nominal data to determine statistically significant differences between sets of qualitative data. Additionally, you might use nominal data to create multiple-choice survey responses or to profile participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Ordinal data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/ordinal-data/&quot;&gt;Ordinal data&lt;/a&gt; is qualitative data categorized in a particular order or on a ranging scale. When researchers use ordinal data, the order of the qualitative information matters more than the difference between each category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, questionnaire responses on a scale from satisfied to unsatisfied are considered ordinal data results. Data analysts might use ordinal data when creating charts, while researchers might use it to classify groups such as age, gender, or class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data examples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data is all around you. We’re going to cover how this type of data might appear in descriptions, research, work, and statistics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data in descriptions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Describing data points can create more context in your analysis. Here are some basic examples of qualitative data in a descriptive style:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman has light brown hair and bright blue eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The office was dark and cold with light tan wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purple flowers smelled like lilac and lavender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plump, white dog had cute whiskers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tall businessman wore a gray striped suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tan leather couch was soft and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data in research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data research methods allow analysts to describe and explain their subjects and use that information to create theories and models. This can be helpful to understand motivations and actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Examples of qualitative data collection in research include open-ended and close-ended questions like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What state do you live in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your most recent degree: bachelor’s, master’s, or Ph.D.?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you rank against your competition? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which digital intelligence platform do you use the most: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt;, Google Analytics, or HotJar?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you rate the restaurant’s customer service: not good, good, great, or excellent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data at work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Professionals in many industries use qualitative observations in their work and research. Examples of this type of data in the workforce include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A professor gives a student feedback on their math skills. &amp;quot;Your calculations are concise, and you understand the core concepts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A psychiatrist observes and analyzes a patient’s behavior. &amp;quot;The woman was angry and disinterested in her husband.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A marketer collects feedback through surveys and customer interviews. &amp;quot;The customer said the onboarding experience was top notch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A doctor evaluates the lifestyle and behavior of patients to determine health risks. &amp;quot;Most patients have elevated blood pressure because of high levels of stress.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lab student transcribes what happens during an experiment: &amp;quot;The solution turned pink when we added salt.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data in statistics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data can provide companies with important statistics about customers, groups of users, and products. Here are some examples of qualitative data set collections for statistical purposes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The origin, gender, and location of citizens so a state legislature can categorize the population in a certain county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name, title, and profession of people attending a webinar to help target the right content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The age, weight, and height of a group of children to determine clothing size charts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pros and cons of qualitative data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative data is a detailed, deep understanding of a topic through observing and interviewing a sample of people. There are both benefits and drawbacks to this type of data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pros of qualitative data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research is affordable and requires a small sample size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative data provides a predictive element and provides specific insight into development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research focuses on the details of personal choice and uses these individual choices as workable data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research works to remove bias from its collected information by using an open-ended process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative data research provides useful content in any data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cons of qualitative data &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative data can be time-consuming to collect and can be difficult to scale out to a larger population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research creates subjective information points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research can involve significant levels of repetition and is often difficult to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research relies on the knowledge of the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualitative research does not offer statistical analysis, for that, you have to turn to quantitative data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A qualitative data collection tool &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By collecting qualitative data using a Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) solution like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt;, data analysts have access to customer intelligence and robust research capabilities. Data analysis is made easy with an efficient data collection tool that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;replays real-time sessions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;DXI combines qualitative &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; qualitative data to analyze the customer experience at different points along their omnichannel journey, and use robust insights to continuously improve the digital customer experience. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[12 trends for better digital customer experience in 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here are the top 12 digital customer experience trends that digital professionals need to be aware of for 2021. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/trends-digital-customer-experience</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/trends-digital-customer-experience</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Madison Eubanks]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article summary:&lt;/b&gt; Staying ahead of arising digital customer experience trends is a crucial part of crafting a successful digital strategy. Based on research from around the digital experience space, we’ve rounded up these new and continuing digital customer experience trends to be on the lookout for in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For digital professionals, predicting and preparing for a new year is always a challenge—and 2021 is shaping up to be exceptionally unpredictable. But even with the uncertainty brought on by the ongoing pandemic, there’s one thing we can be sure of: companies that stay in tune with customers’ needs and provide an exceptional customer experience in this difficult moment will shine. Here, we explore 12 digital customer experience trends that brands should keep top of mind in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. It&amp;#x27;s more important than ever to reassure your customers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We can’t consider what our customers will want and need in the coming year without accounting for the unpredictable effects of the ongoing pandemic. For this very reason, companies must continue to provide reassuring and informative messaging for customers and potential customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This messaging might include how your company is prioritizing the health, welfare, and safety of both customers and employees. It might also include information about aspects of your organization’s user experience that have changed as a result of the pandemic. These communications serve to reassure people who are spending conservatively right now, and let them know what to expect when they do spend with your company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a recent webinar hosted by our partners at Qualtrics, Ona Anicello, Manager of UX Research at Alaska Airlines, said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We&amp;#x27;ve done some things along the guest journey, just to make sure that every step along the way people feel safe, that they feel secure in traveling. Specifically within the booking path, we’re looking at ways that we can communicate to our guests that we do take sanitation and their safety seriously. But also to communicate that if something does go wrong or if you get sick prior to your day of travel, that we&amp;#x27;ll take care of you, that there&amp;#x27;s ways that we&amp;#x27;ll work with you to avoid any change fees and that sort of thing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whatever industry you’re in, it will continue to be critical in 2021 to communicate with wary customers early and often about the ways in which you are prioritizing their needs—from health precautions and cleanliness standards, to return and cancellation policies. Reassure your customers that you will protect them in this time when so many things are outside of their control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Digital transformation is top-of-mind (and it needs to happen fast)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You’ve been hearing the phrase “digital transformation” for years. But as peoples’ lives become increasingly digital-first, the concept is quickly moving from buzzword to serious strategy, guiding many organizations’ short- and long-term business goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a recent interview, Margaret Wise, Chief Revenue Officer at a leading digital consultancy, said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I think of digital transformation as the effort to de-silo digital, moving from digital as a separate channel to digital as embedded across an organization … It’s critical to develop your digital strategy in line with your organization’s strategic goals. Digital transformation is enormous and you can’t bite everything off at once; you’ll always have to prioritize limited resources.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Organizations that invest heavily–and strategically–in digital transformation were three times as likely to have significantly exceeded top business goals in 2019, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/www/us/en/offer/digital-trends-2020/digital-trends-2020-full-report.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adobe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And the challenges and benefits of pursuing digital transformation aren’t restricted to any one industry. Read more about how digital leaders from three different industries approach strategic digital transformation in our recent three-part interview series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-transformation-strategy-arke&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Part I: Insights from a leading digital consultancy on how to do digital transformation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/company-culture-digital-transformation-at-moosejaw&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Part II: Insights from Moosejaw’s CTO on how organizational culture supports digital transformation &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/future-is-digital/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Part III: CEO at digital-first brand, Pirate Ship, on why the future of commerce is digital-or-bust&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Cross-functional team collaboration is key to efficient remote work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In 2020, we saw massive shifts to remote work, with nearly 20 percent of the global workforce now working from home. This, paired with budget cuts at many companies, has highlighted inefficiencies in daily practices that were less evident in a traditional office environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/www/us/en/offer/digital-trends-2020/digital-trends-2020-full-report.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adobe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 53 percent of large organizations report that outdated workflows slow down their processes and stand in the way of meaningful digital transformation in 2020. Adobe provides the example of data silos as an outdated practice that inhibits progress: in an organization where stakeholders don’t share expertise, data, and resources, customer experience can’t evolve at the speed of the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In 2021, companies should focus on replacing outdated, overly time-consuming workflows with more automated, and therefore more cost-effective, processes. This will likely involve rethinking how teams across your organization collaborate and share information, resources, and goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For many companies, ironing out the wrinkles in working from home and reducing costs go hand in hand, and will require you to focus on restructuring teams, aligning on goals, and breaking down data silos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Customers gravitate toward brands that are socially and environmentally conscious &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Across the board, companies are competing for consumer dollars and loyalty by offering low prices, free shipping, and any number of other enticements. But smart brands are escaping this race to the bottom by offering customers something they’re willing to pay for: shared values. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With issues like climate change and social justice occupying more space in peoples’ minds, many consumers are looking for ways to align their values with their shopping habits. When given the choice between two nearly identical brands—one that upholds a particular consumer value and one that doesn’t—people choose values, even if this means paying a slightly higher price. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When it comes to eco-friendliness:&lt;/b&gt; 77 percent of consumers say that looking for brands that are sustainable and/or environmentally responsible is very important or moderately important to them, and 72 percent of those consumers are willing to pay a premium for that. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/EXK4XKX8&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;IBM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And on the topic of social change: &lt;/b&gt;81 percent of consumers say that their ability to trust a brand “to do what is right” is a deal breaker or deciding factor in their buying decision, and 69 percent of consumers have growing concerns about brands’ impact on society. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edelman.com/sites/g/files/aatuss191/files/2019-02/2019_Edelman_Trust_Barometer_Global_Report.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Edelman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The logic behind this buying behavior is easy to see. In the eye of the consumer, shopping with a brand that supports one of their values is like killing two birds with one stone: they get the product or service they need, and they feel like they’ve contributed to a worthy cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Chances are that if your organization is built on a philanthropic concept (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bombas.com/pages/about-us&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bombas’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sock donation for every purchase), that messaging is already part of your marketing strategy. But for other companies, there might be other initiatives you can highlight to demonstrate your values to your customers. Maybe you ship your products in 100 percent recycled packaging, or your organization has committed to a set of employee diversity goals. An organization’s principles are increasingly meaningful to shoppers, so it’s important to consider ways to be vocal about your values. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Storytelling and content are front and center for digital marketers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to the competitive digital advertising space, standing out from the crowd and winning consumers’ attention has been a growing challenge for brands over the past decade. As the competition for consumer attention grows fiercer, brands are finding new ways to relate to their audience and build loyalty through storytelling and content marketing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rather than traditional product advertising, many digital marketers are focusing their efforts on building emotional connections and relationships with their audience. This trend of marketing through storytelling isn’t a new one, but it’s only becoming more prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In an article for Common Thread Collective, Aaron Orendorff writes: &lt;i&gt;“The power of content lies in entering an audience’s heart and mind through a consistent story well told; one with people, not products, at its core.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And though the concept of storytelling and content marketing has been around for some time, many companies are still figuring out how to do it—and measure it—effectively. &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalmarketinginstitute.com/blog/10-trends-in-digital-marketing-in-2020&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Marketing Institute&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that while 86 percent of B2C companies use content marketing, only 33 percent have a documented strategy and less than half actually measure the ROI of content marketing efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These numbers add up to one fact: marketers who thoughtfully document and execute on a content strategy, and then measure and iterate on that strategy, will excel in the advertising space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Similarly, interactive marketing content is also becoming more popular as we enter 2021. This category includes any type of marketing that a user can get involved in rather than just looking at (or scrolling past). A few examples include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video content that appears across various channels &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quizzes that curate some kind of personalized experience or information for the user&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality ads, like a 360 degree view of a store or hotel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The bottom line? Marketing that centers humans—whether by telling a story or by involving the target audience—is the most direct path to a customer’s heart in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Loyalty and retention marketing leap ahead &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Increased competition. Decreased customer confidence. These are just some of the reasons why finding &lt;i&gt;new&lt;/i&gt; audiences and first-time purchasers is more challenging for companies than ever. Plus, finding a new customer costs five times more than retaining an existing customer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Heading into 2021, the most successful companies will heavily emphasize customer loyalty and retention, rather than seeking new audiences. A few examples of loyalty and retention tactics include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loyalty programs based on points, dollars spent, rebates, etc., or VIP programs that offer members year-round perks. Amazon Prime is perhaps the most successful example of a VIP program; members get access to Amazon’s streaming service, free two-day shipping on many items, and exclusive discounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add value to your product or service by offering customers a community element, like a customer forum or even a customer advisory board for your most valued customers. Peloton, for example, offers users the ability to join riding communities that incentivize them to continue renewing their monthly membership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering an onboarding program for new users/customers; if they better understand the value of your product, they’ll be more likely to continue using it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emphasizing your company’s values across customer-facing touch points—as mentioned earlier, people increasingly choose to purchase from brands that align with their own beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Personalization in digital commerce is no longer just a nice-to-have&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The ability to deliver personalized user and shopper experiences is rapidly becoming table stakes for companies. From marketing emails to dynamic advertisements, customers don’t just &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; a personalized online shopping experience, they &lt;i&gt;expect&lt;/i&gt; it. According to data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.epsilon.com/pressroom/new-epsilon-research-indicates-80-of-consumers-are-more-likely-to-make-a-purchase-when-brands-offer-personalized-experiences&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Epsilon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 80 percent of shoppers are more likely to buy from a company that offers personalized experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While companies understand this expectation, many still struggle to offer relevant personalized experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Effective personalization is difficult: it requires data, resources, and a thoughtful strategy. That’s a tall order, but research shows it’s worthwhile: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;44 percent of consumers say that they will likely become repeat buyers after a personalized shopping experience with a particular company, according to our partners at &lt;a href=&quot;http://grow.segment.com/Segment-2017-Personalization-Report.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Segment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And marketers report seeing an average increase of 20 percent in sales when offering personalized experiences, per data from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.monetate.com/blog/the-tipping-point-for-personalized-website-experiences/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Monetate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are two things every company should consider before investing in personalization: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer data is the key to successful personalization. After all, you can’t build a custom experience for someone you know nothing about. So ask yourself: &lt;i&gt;Do we have a sufficient amount of customer data to effectively offer personalized experiences?&lt;/i&gt; Data about your customers—who they are, where they are, how they behave online—is the foundation for audience segmentation, the first step to personalized experiences &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before launching an ambitious personalization push at your organization, make sure that your team has the resources—both the appropriate technology and the time—to manage it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
You’ll also want to make sure you have a process in place for validating your ideas and efforts around personalization. How will you measure success? How will you iterate on your efforts? A thoughtful personalization strategy should become more automated over time, but requires plenty of legwork up front. Who will be responsible for monitoring your personalization strategy? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots deliver better digital customer support&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
In recent years, more and more companies have started to use chatbots for customer support. This trend, like many others, has accelerated in 2020 due to the pandemic. With more people turning to the internet to complete previously in-person tasks (like shopping and working), the need for online support is increasing proportionally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this new online-all-the-time reality, the benefits of chatbot support are undeniable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the customer side, benefits include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatbots are available 24 hours a day and can provide instant responses for customers who need support outside of business hours or in different time zones, and 74 percent of customers today expect to have access to 24-hour support (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/campaign/chatbot-survey&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Intercom&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatbots provide automated help that many customers find desirable: about 40 percent of customers say they actually prefer to communicate with a chatbot over a person when shopping online (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tidio.com/blog/chatbot-statistics/#customer-experience-expectations&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tidio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And on the company’s side: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatbots can answer up to 80 percent of standard user questions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2017/10/how-chatbots-reduce-customer-service-costs-by-30-percent/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;IBM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), freeing up support agents to focus on more complex problems or projects &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatbots can act as an inbound channel for sales, and 67 percent of business leaders say bots have increased their sales (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/campaign/chatbot-survey&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Intercom&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, chatbots save money for companies by generating quick responses, saving on headcount, and adding to overall efficiency &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of course, companies need to keep in mind that software can’t always replace human interaction. Using chatbots successfully means enabling them to enhance, rather than replace, support agents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Emphasis on improving mobile experience continues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each year, actions taken on mobile devices—whether shopping, working, or researching—are trending upward. The average adult spends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bondcap.com/report/itr19/#view/title&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly four hours a day&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a mobile device. And in 2020, 40 percent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.adobe.com/en/2019/12/02/adobe-data-shows-record-cyber-monday-with-9-2-billion-in-online-sales.html#gs.gevth2&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Black Friday sales&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were made from mobile devices for a revenue of $3.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Companies can no longer afford to have a less-than-ideal mobile experience. Here are two basic-but-critical things you can do to provide a better mobile experience: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Address your page load speed:&lt;/b&gt; According to Google, 53 percent of mobile users will abandon a page if it takes more than three seconds to load. There’s no singular quick fix for speeding up your mobile site and / or app, but here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/better-mobile-e-commerce/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a few steps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you can take to improve your mobile experience leading up to the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Test browsers and screen sizes:&lt;/b&gt; To ensure that your mobile site renders correctly across all browsers and devices, you’re going to have to do some grunt work. Use your phone to go through the checkout flow on top browsers: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, MS Edge and Opera. Do this from an iPhone, an Android, an iPad and a windows tablet. Note and address any issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For more on mobile-specific trends in 2021, read this post written by our partners and leading mobile app agency, Yodel Mobile → &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/mobile-app-trends&quot;&gt;5 key mobile trends for 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Volume of business-to-consumer communications will remain higher than usual&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since the start of the pandemic, communications from brands to their customers have been trending steadily upward. This trend began in the early days of the pandemic as brands sought to keep customers informed about store closures, new programs like curbside pickup and contactless delivery, and the reassuring messaging that we touched on previously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But as time went on and people adjusted to new shopping norms, the higher levels of business-to-customer communication didn’t decline. Brands continued their efforts to reach consumers directly through email, text messages, and push notifications as they fought to retain their customer base. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And this trend is expected to continue: according to a Forrester report, marketing message volume will increase by as much as 40 percent in 2021. With more messages landing in customers’ inboxes, companies will need to be creative and intentional to earn and maintain their audience’s attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. A seamless customer journey is critical, and analytics can help&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Web and app analytics tools are now widely available, and nearly all digital companies use them in some capacity. In many cases, different teams are using different analytics tools to measure various customer behaviors This often creates data silos and makes it difficult to understand the whole digital customer experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Organizations that have a complete picture of their customers’ digital experience generally have a higher digital experience maturity level—which is directly linked to higher revenue and overall organizational success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory’s original research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on digital experience maturity, 45 percent of more mature digital organizations report having a complete picture of their customers’ digital experience, while only 10 percent of less mature organizations report the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That complete DX picture—that is, understanding both what people do on your site and why they do it—is the foundation of a successful digital strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To achieve this, organizations need the ability to 1) ingest complete, unsampled data and 2) the means to analyze quantitative and qualitative data together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Organizations can bring together these critical pieces of the puzzle with a thoughtfully curated and highly integrated tech stack that collects &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; analyzes the necessary customer data. According to our research, organizations that report delivering an ideal digital experience more often are 223% more likely to report that they have a &lt;b&gt;very integrated technology stack&lt;/b&gt; than their less successful counterparts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Responsible, transparent customer data management is a non-negotiable&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From geolocation and device preference to past purchase behavior, businesses rely on customer data to help them deliver better, more personalized digital experiences. And people are increasingly aware—and increasingly wary—of that fact. This heightened concern over customer data collection and use is due, in part, to high profile data management failures in recent years, from misuse to large-scale breaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To gather this valuable data, a company needs to first earn its customers’ trust: according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/future-of-customer-experience.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;PwC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 88 percent of US consumers say that how much they trust a company determines how much they’re willing to share personal information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Responsible data practices also help to create trust and boost customer loyalty. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2019/06/customer-engagement-trends.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Salesforce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that 78 percent of people say they’re more loyal to companies that are transparent about how their data is used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So how does a company ensure that it’s managing data responsibly? Put broadly, organizations need to implement a data governance strategy. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://segment.com/resources/cdp/customer-data-management/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Segment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a data governance strategy is a set of principles around what data an organization will collect, how they’ll collect it, and how they will ensure it’s safe from unauthorized access. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nearly all of these trends can be tied into one essential concept: customer experience is king, and successful organizations will focus on continually improving digital customer experience in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/future-of-customer-experience.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;One in three customers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; say they will stop doing business with a company after just one bad experience—and when your competitors are just a click away, your digital customer experience needs to be seamless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data shows that organizations understand that digital customer experience will increasingly act as a competitive differentiator: according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/key-findings-from-the-gartner-customer-experience-survey&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gartner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 81 percent of marketers in 2020 expected to compete almost solely on the basis of CX. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These stats make one thing clear: Customer experience is going to be a key battleground for all digital companies in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ready to start strategically improving your digital customer experience to stay ahead of the trends? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get a FullStory demo today.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Wistia’s growth team uses FullStory to run experiments]]></title><description><![CDATA[How Fullstory can help after you launch, to keep developing — with real, live feedback from actual customers.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-wistias-growth-team-uses-fullstory-to-run-experiments</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-wistias-growth-team-uses-fullstory-to-run-experiments</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin Owings]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2017 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’ve toughed out the early stages of building a product from scratch, it can seem like the launch of your product is the finish line where you get a little time to rest, pat yourself on the back, and relax. Except anyone who is part of a successful, growing company knows this couldn’t be further from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After you launch, you have to keep developing — this time with real, live feedback from actual customers. As you manage growth, you must be simultaneously streamlining internal processes. It’s a juggling act and it’s easy to drop the ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/&quot;&gt;Video hosting company Wistia&lt;/a&gt; found this out firsthand when they built their business video solutions from startup to successful company. They have gradually streamlined their process for building their product and their company, and they have used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt; to do it from early on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We had the chance to talk with Andrew Capland, Director of Growth at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/welcomeback&quot;&gt;Wistia&lt;/a&gt; (And recent expert contributor to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/marketers-customer-experience-guide/&quot;&gt;Marketer’s Guide to Customer Experience&lt;/a&gt;), about how FullStory fits into their growth process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Investigate problems in the customer experience.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every company wants to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tagged/customer-experience&quot;&gt;improve their customer experience&lt;/a&gt; — Wistia is no exception. They use FullStory to discover weak links in their customer experience, seeing those moments as opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Andrew Capland, Director of Growth at Wistia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wistia initiates customer experience research by &lt;b&gt;clarifying pain points.&lt;/b&gt; They use FullStory to pinpoint the exact moments that frustrate users. Here’s Andrew:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we had FullStory we did a lot of guessing. We’d say, ‘Hey, there’s an opportunity and here’s why I think that,’ and then we’d try to cobble together some data to validate the assumption… &lt;b&gt;FullStory helps us validate opportunities with a lot more confidence.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any time you can get closer to your users and closer to your customers is hugely beneficial. You know things that they’re excited about and things that are really confusing to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Getting a live window (as with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt;) into every problem that pops up is an important part of researching Wistia’s customer experience. Andrew shares, “On the growth team, [when we notice customers getting stuck] we’ll share a link to a FullStory session. This clarifies whether someone is just stopped and confused, or if part of that process is just fundamentally broken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As &lt;b&gt;qualitative data&lt;/b&gt;, watching session replay allows Wistia to assess what is actually going on when a customer experiences a problem. This is a crucial way they explore customer problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of course, FullStory isn’t the only way Wistia digs into customer experience. They also just take the time to talk to users. Asking why a Wistia user didn’t take that final step to create an account can be illuminating, providing an important supplement to session replay and help understand what customers do and don’t want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, &lt;b&gt;quantitative data&lt;/b&gt; plays a role in figuring out where people are dropping off, and indicating what places the growth team should investigate further. Analytics provide a good start, and information from strategically placed surveys can round out the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wistia’s multi-pronged approach to pinpointing problems makes for a deep investigation of the customer experience. From this arises a fully-realized problem to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Experiment.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once Wistia has identified a problem, they go on to experiment to figure out the best way to solve it. Their experimentation phase has three steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brainstorm solutions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Choose an idea &lt;/b&gt;they think will be successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Run an experiment &lt;/b&gt;(e.g. an A/B test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, Wistia had a problem with users getting stuck during onboarding if they didn’t have a video ready to upload into their new account. Having a video to play with during the tutorial was an important part of ensuring users could see the robust features Wistia’s video service offers. The Wistia Growth team knew they had an opportunity to make onboarding a better experience for users by helping them complete the process — even if they didn’t have a video available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So the team &lt;b&gt;brainstormed solutions&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;chose an idea&lt;/b&gt;— provide users with a pre-made video they could learn from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first video Wistia chose to offer their new users was a cute, generic video, and the team quickly noticed that users weren’t actually watching the video all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They raised the stakes and made a how-to video that would help new users learn the product &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; perform double-duty as the necessary onboarding video with which they could manipulate the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are screencaps of the default video for new users. Note the video relates to the interface (the pointing)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Then, Wistia &lt;b&gt;ran an experiment&lt;/b&gt; and A/B tested to see if users were getting into the video customization tools faster with their new instructional clip. After waiting for enough traffic that they’d have statistically valid results, they saw a 30% increase in their customization engagement metric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wistia’s process can be used by any organization so long as there is a mechanism in place to test the idea and measure results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; If you’re looking to run a similar experiment with new users in FullStory, you can research the sessions of your new users by simply toggling “New this week” in the left menu when you’re logged into FullStory (look for the pacifier icon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The new users sessions in the FullStory app (Note this screenshot is from our testing app &lt;a href=&quot;http://fruitshoppe.firebaseapp.com/&quot;&gt;Fruitshoppe&lt;/a&gt; and not Wistia)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Evaluate results.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With growth comes new features and with new features comes the need to understand how customers are responding to product changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wistia uses FullStory to help measure early results and catch confused customers. Andrew shares:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We use FullStory to make sure that there aren’t any gotchas, or any unforeseen bugs, or user experiences we didn’t anticipate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we launch, we’ll watch people roll into our experiment and see what they do. Oftentimes the experience that we think we have crafted might need to be tweaked a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re not a FullStory user or have never used session replay, when Andrew says “we’ll watch people roll into our experiment,” he literally means watch the replication of the users session — like a pixel-perfect video reproduction of what the user saw, did, clicked, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session replay not only allows Wistia to head off problems before they frustrate too many users, but it also helps them evaluate whether or not a refinement to the product is working or still needs fine-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watching user sessions is not the only way to gauge success. Wistia analyzes core metrics to understand the impact of any changes they make, as well. Wistia knows the metrics they expect to change, and monitors those metrics closely as a standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“I don’t think we’re doing anything revolutionary,” says Andrew of the team’s dedication to watching and keeping track of important events, yet seeing the process through makes “the biggest difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Seizing opportunity means knowing your product.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you’re trying to build incredible products from the ground up, understanding the customer experience as your company grows and your product changes is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wistia is an incredible product being made better all the time. As Wistia users ourselves, we’re proud that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt; helps them perfect their product by providing qualitative and quantitative research into real user behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Can you strike a balance between customer advocacy and product management?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Take a deeper look at the importance of customer advocacy and ways to think about striking a balance across different teams. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-balance-between-customer-advocacy-and-product-management/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-balance-between-customer-advocacy-and-product-management/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2017 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer advocacy is one of those things that seems like it should be simple. A customer has a problem, someone picks that up and acts as a mouthpiece for that customer, and the problem is fixed by a responsive customer service person, product manager (PM), or engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Anyone who has had a hand in customer advocacy — or customer support — knows that things are almost never that simple. Customer problems are not cut-and-dry. Advocacy can get lost between tickets and tools and teams. And PMs are often in the trenches bettering the product ways that have nothing to do with the customer problems at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer advocacy can be difficult and frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt; we are always looking for ways to make customer advocacy better, which is why we were excited to hear about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invisionapp.com/&quot;&gt;InVision&lt;/a&gt; does customer-first advocacy from Brandon Wolf, InVision’s Vice President of User Enablement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Previously, we talked with Wolf about how InVision &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/how-invision-picks-the-right-product-management-tools-for-support/&quot;&gt;picks the right tools&lt;/a&gt; to manage their support system. Today’s discussion stems from the same conversation but focuses on how companies can keep customers satisfied without feeling like their customers have too much control over what happens and when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Great customer advocacy starts with shared understanding.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Making sure customers are heard through internal advocates starts with fostering a culture where there’s shared understanding and respect across teams. This way, customer advocates can push product managers without it being taken as an affront. And PMs can push back knowing that customer advocates will buffer the response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“We try and do some internal calculus between getting our position and doing the customer’s voice justice — but still acknowledging their issue needs to fold into our outstanding backlogs,” says Wolf, nodding to that mutual work and respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Shared understanding results in support professionals becoming better advocates for the customers they’re trying to help. “I think that sort of interplay and marriage between support and product managers — and to their counterpoints in engineering — makes that customer advocacy possible.” (See also: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/how-to-convince-your-product-manager-that-a-bug-needs-to-get-fixed/&quot;&gt;How to Convince your Product Manager that a Bug Needs to Get Fixed&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wolf also notes that celebrating customer happiness and keeping positive customer stories visible is a good way to keep customer experience visible in the company. At InVision, Wolf says, “We have a #customerhappiness Slack channel so people can see a running RSS feed of customer happiness throughout the day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using a Slack channel or sharing customer happiness in some other way (We built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/love&quot;&gt;Wall of Love&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose) can keep teams focused on improving &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/customer-experience&quot;&gt;customer experience&lt;/a&gt; without anchoring the business solely to firedrill-inducing customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Stay on the level with your customers.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can’t solve every customer problem, fix all the bugs, and customize the product to exact customer specifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When customers have bug problems that won’t be fixed or feature suggestions that will never be implemented, ghosting them by failing to address their issue — not replying — leaves your customer in the dark. When cases come along where the ideal solution isn’t feasible, Wolf says it’s best to communicate plainly, even if it’s bad news. At InVision, Wolf notes, “‘No, but thank you for your feedback,’ is almost always universally well received.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While what you are telling a customer may not be what they’d ideally like to hear, it should at least be straightforward — candid (And not canned). “I think that as a customer myself, getting an answer back of ‘there really is no ETA for this to be fixed …’ is a far better reply than just ‘Thanks for your message …’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sometimes simply being heard is what’s most important. Transparent, frank responses help maintain good standing with customers while tempering their sway on product development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Listening isn’t just reading complaints.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A key part of understanding how and when to advocate for your customers is harvesting feedback for how they really feel — both the customers who reach out with problems and the ones who don’t. You don’t want to be swayed by a vocally unhappy 5% of customers if 95% of your customers are in love with your product, but you also don’t want to ignore negative comments if they are a good indicator of overall customer happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It can help to see how customers use your product and understand how they feel about it. At InVision, customer success and account managers reach out proactively to “take customers’ temperatures […] in a much more holistic sense,” according to Wolf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The default, low-touch solution can be as simple as asking how people’s experience is after they reach out to support. “At InVision we have a Zendesk integration, and each ticket involves sending out a comment about how their support integration was.” Wolf said. “And of our solicitations, about 30% of people actually take the time to reply — which demonstrates a impressive level of investment in the interaction — and of that population, we enjoy an industry-leading 98% Customer Satisfaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;user session replays&lt;/a&gt; (as with FullStory) can also be a good way to understand whether it’s just a single user having an issue or if that customer’s experience is indicative of a larger problem. For example, reviewing customer sessions can reveal a design issue that’s causing &lt;a href=&quot;http://fs-blog.ghost.io/fullstory-rage-clicks-error-clicks-dead-clicks/&quot;&gt;rage clicks&lt;/a&gt; — indicative of an issue that will affect many more users than those who take the time to contact support. (This also makes for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/proactive-support&quot;&gt;opportunity for proactive support&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer advocacy is about finding a balance.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Balancing a commitment to customers and customer advocacy can be difficult when you’re trying to build a product and run a company. It’s important for customer advocates to feel like they can represent your users well, but they also need to be judicious about what to bring forward and push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By creating a culture where empathy for customers is embraced in a balanced way across your organization through customer advocacy can make for a level foundation upon which a great customer experience can be built.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[TrueCar boosts engagement and increases conversions with FullStory]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn how TrueCar extracts qualitative and quantitative insights from FullStory to drive digital experience improvements and boost key KPIs.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/truecar-improves-digital-experience-with-fullstory</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/truecar-improves-digital-experience-with-fullstory</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[FullStory]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 Nov 2019 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Experience is the new battleground for digital commerce companies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over price and positioning, an ideal customer experience is what separates leading brands from the ones that are rapidly falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Customers make decisions based on the salience and value of experiences — and firms simply have no choice but to win at CX.” — &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://go.forrester.com/future-of-cx/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Future of CX&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, Forrester 2019&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Operationalizing CX improvements isn’t easy.

With a network of over 16,000 dealerships, TrueCar currently informs the car-buying process for over one third of all new car buyers—that’s hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The company needed to enable their product team to quickly identify what is and isn’t working for TrueCar’s shoppers (the &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;)—and take action (addressing the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;). They needed an engine that would power quick, evidence-driven decisions around experience improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They struggled to make this ideal a reality. The product team was hitting a wall using existing tools and product managers weren’t able to unearth actionable insights. They needed a tool that would be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intuitive to use, facilitating program management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A supplement to their existing tech stack, amplifying existing capabilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source of both quantitative &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;qualitative insights about the digital experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This led them to FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;TrueCar generates 3,000 additional monthly conversions and increases engagement in a key customer journey by 50%&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The product team at TrueCar uses FullStory for its quantitative and qualitative capabilities. They can analyze user interactions with the product &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/conversions/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;in aggregate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, similar to traditional web analytics. And with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt;, the team can delve deeper to observe &lt;i&gt;directly&lt;/i&gt; what people &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; as they interact with the digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They are able to identify and quantify the magnitude of an issue &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; illuminate the why at the heart of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Example: TrueCar builds a business case for new search functionality resulting in a successful rollout and increased conversions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A year ago, search on TrueCar was siloed. Shoppers first had to choose “new” or “used” cars. Then they could search by high level criteria—such as best match or lowest price—and filter down on a specific set of vehicles that fit their needs. These filtered search results were all new cars or they were all used cars. What if a customer wanted to evaluate all the options across both categories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The product team wanted to give shoppers more control over their search experience. They proposed a new search functionality that would allow shoppers to view both new and used cars that fit their other search criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before rolling this new functionality out to their entire user base, they wanted to know whether it would actually have a positive impact on the digital shopping experience. So they released the feature to a subset of their users and used FullStory to capture experience data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The team wanted to understand how users were interacting with the new search functionality and, of course, they were hoping to see an incremental increase in conversions. After several weeks, FullStory data had revealed a few key insights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many TrueCar shoppers entering the site via search were interested in viewing both new and used cars, validating the initial idea behind the updated search&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users seemed to understand the new search functionality: They were able to search only new or used cars, depending on preference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major UX bug was proving very frustrating to users, resulting in over 4,000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/list-your-top-rage-clicks-and-dead-clicks/&quot;&gt;Dead Clicks&lt;/a&gt;—the team was able to quickly prioritize this fix&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most importantly, the new search functionality was delivering that incremental increase in conversions. The team had only shipped this functionality on one digital property and they were able to deliver over &lt;b&gt;3,000 incremental monthly prospects&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Example: TrueCar increases engagement by 50% in one of their most valuable customer journeys&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;TrueCar’s configurator flow is a journey wherein a shopper can build their ideal virtual vehicle step by step: style, color, add-ons, etc. Once built, they can search to see if this vehicle, or one that is a close match, is available at a dealership nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The product team has been running experiments to increase engagement within this flow, with the ultimate goal of helping users find a close match to the vehicle of their dreams. This is an extremely valuable journey for TrueCar as shoppers who use the configurator flow are more likely to buy a car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The team uses different tools, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://launchdarkly.com/&quot;&gt;LaunchDarkly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.optimizely.com/&quot;&gt;Optimizely&lt;/a&gt;, to A/B test changes to the configurator flow to try to increase engagement. Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/heatmap/&quot;&gt;heatmaps&lt;/a&gt; in FullStory, they can explore how users are engaging with each A/B test variant to understand why one might be performing better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This feature provides a visual overlay of aggregate, page-level statistics for any page or screen within a user session. This is technically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantitative data&lt;/a&gt;—you can see absolute clicks and percentages. But in visualizing this aggregate data, the team can see and imagine where users are engaging, how they are interacting; they can get closer to that individual experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using FullStory in combination with these A/B testing tools, TrueCar has been able to iterate on the configurator flow in a high-impact way, increasing engagement by over 50% over the past 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jane looks to FullStory to fashion a seamless online experience]]></title><description><![CDATA[How Jane's eCommerce team uses insights from FullStory to understand and improve the customer experience online.

What&amp;#x27;s also clear is just how serious they are about creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/customer-experience/&quot;&gt;customer experience&lt;/a&gt; as delightful and sophisticated as the goods they sell. A steadfast desire to elevate this experience is the common thread woven through the very fabric of their organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;We wanted to be able to understand a deeper level of the behaviors on how people were using Jane.
                    —Colby Bell
                       Product Manager, Jane&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Product designer Adam Christiansen echoes Colby&amp;#x27;s sentiments. &amp;quot;We needed to see what the customer&amp;#x27;s experience was from end to end,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;We wanted to understand what&amp;#x27;s tripping people up, what&amp;#x27;s taking longer, what&amp;#x27;s moving quickly, and be able to really identify the pain points in their experience.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When the Jane product team began using FullStory, they knew they had found the platform that would help them tailor the experience of using jane.com to fit their customers just right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;All Dressed Up With Nowhere to Go&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before the Jane product team discovered FullStory, their determination to make the customer experience as smooth as possible was hindered by the uncertainty of knowing exactly which steps to take. &amp;quot;There were a lot of assumptions when trying to figure out exactly what to build [or fix] next,&amp;quot; product manager Colby Bell says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Without an efficient and cost-effective way to see exactly how real customers navigated through Jane, employees had to rely on anecdotal evidence from family and friends who visited the site, or they were forced to wade through the pitfalls of traditional &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/why-you-cant-do-a-user-interview-without-skin-in-the-game/&quot;&gt;user testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Prior to FullStory, we invested a lot of time and resources on getting surveys out, trying to schedule appointments, getting recordings in place, and nine times out of 10 there would be a no-show. All that time and resources was kind of a sunk cost,&amp;quot; describes product manager McCall Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Assumptions Are Out of Style; Answers Are In Vogue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But now, with FullStory&amp;#x27;s help, the Jane team can systematically and quickly make sure their customer experience is runway-ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Gone are the assumptions, second guesses, and inefficient research methods. In their place are the deeper-level insights and solutions that come from being able to watch visual re-creations of every user interaction on their site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now when the team investigates a specific issue or workflow, all they have to do is use FullStory&amp;#x27;s industry-leading search capabilities to find the exact &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;user sessions&lt;/a&gt; based on whatever criteria they want that match their criteria and watch them unfold in all their first-person glory. Whether it&amp;#x27;s sessions with abandoned carts or &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-fullstory-on-funnels/&quot;&gt;broken purchase funnels&lt;/a&gt;, they see everything the customer experienced on Jane—from the user&amp;#x27;s perspective—and are able to quickly troubleshoot, prioritize, and strategize ways to make the customer experience better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pass the Word: FullStory Helps Optimize Everything&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Recently, Jane wanted to investigate its password reset workflow to see if it met their exacting standards for an effortless customer experience. What&amp;#x27;s this workflow really like for the customers who go through it? How many customers encounter a problem during the process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory quickly shed light on the situation. Replaying the sessions of users who initiated a password reset helped the Jane team decide which optimizations needed to be made and how much of a priority they should be. &amp;quot;[FullStory] exposes in a really short amount of time, oh yeah, we&amp;#x27;re clearly having issues with these problems, [and] we can verify hypotheses super quick before we spend too much resources or time,&amp;quot; Smith confides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Any eCommerce company really should have this type of technology. If they don&amp;#x27;t, they&amp;#x27;re missing out on a huge opportunity to optimize, to better their platform, to keep in touch with their customers, and to provide that feedback loop real-time with visual representation of exactly what the user is seeing. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;It&amp;#x27;s critical&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.

Unsure what to address first? If you want to move quickly and boost conversions but have found yourself drowning in data, listen up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dana DiTomaso, President &amp;amp; Partner at &lt;a href=&quot;https://kickpoint.ca/&quot;&gt;Kick Point&lt;/a&gt;, recently offered up her expertise via a webinar titled &lt;i&gt;Why Won&amp;#x27;t They Click This Button? Conversion Audits for Busy Marketers&lt;/i&gt;. The presentation was facilitated by Alexa Hubley, Customer Marketing Strategist at Unbounce, and was one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://unbounce.com/marketing-optimization-week/&quot;&gt;14 webinar recordings&lt;/a&gt; viewed by over 8,000 marketers as part of &lt;i&gt;Marketing Optimization Week&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dana&amp;#x27;s presentation focused on how to bring together a site audit, analytics, and session replay and build a full picture of what&amp;#x27;s preventing conversions and causing user friction—and gain a list of specific action items you can implement right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Turn conversion audits into conversion fixes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Audits are great at helping you figure out everything that&amp;#x27;s wrong with a site. Unfortunately, when audits uncover a list of issues a mile long, busy marketers often simply don&amp;#x27;t have time to go through them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That&amp;#x27;s why it&amp;#x27;s important to quickly identify the most impactful fixes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Focus on what matters most&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can start getting to the fixes that really matter by asking the right questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s the most broken?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What fix would have the most benefit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where are our best visitors (e.g., the ones who give you money) falling down? Where do they encounter problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;FullStory session replay&lt;/a&gt; helps you answer these questions and determine which issues are the most important—and on top of that, it helps guide you in solving them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The conversion audit advantage of FullStory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A traditional audit will outline your site&amp;#x27;s problems without giving you any additional insight into what&amp;#x27;s causing them. FullStory, on the other hand, marries &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together/&quot;&gt;quantitative and qualitative data&lt;/a&gt; to identify problems &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; inspire the solutions. Most importantly, it helps Dana&amp;#x27;s team move fast:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you use FullStory session replay to investigate your user experience, you watch issues happen from the first-person perspective of customers &lt;i&gt;who actually experienced them&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, you can watch sessions from paid search traffic and infer what is and what isn&amp;#x27;t working based on their actual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Or you can use FullStory to analyze marketing funnels. Dana notes, &amp;quot;You can set up a funnel at any time, involving any steps, and unlike Google Analytics, you don’t need to wait for it to update.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory funnels show you the true picture of where your customers drop off so you can start addressing the biggest gaps. And because you don&amp;#x27;t have to worry about setting funnels up in advance, you can build one &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; get a visualization of results in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But how can FullStory be used with conversion audits?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5 FullStory conversion audit hacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re ready for a specific action plan to put FullStory to work for your site audits, begin with this 5-point conversion audit to do list:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for underperforming pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure your paid search is paying off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deal with your rage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the browser/OS combo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Build segments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;segment is any saved search in FullStory&lt;/a&gt;. You can search for users who took step A, step B., etc. to build a funnel (as shown above or detailed in this blog post on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-fastest-funnels-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;Fastest Funnels on the Web&lt;/a&gt;), and/or who meet any combination of demographic or device criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dana advises that you begin by creating segments for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://kickpoint.ca/why-use-personas/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;high-value personas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: the users who are (or could be) your best customers. This will help you aim the fire hose of session replay data at the most urgent blazes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;→ Read more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/learn-from-power-users-and-improve-your-product/&quot;&gt;finding Top Users in FullStory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; What can you learn from your heaviest users? Search for their sessions and see how they engage with your website or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Look for underperforming pages&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next, Dana recommends running a Google Analytics report to get a list of the pages on your site with the lowest conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the Google Analytics report can focus your attention by showing you the pages where users struggle, only in watching real users interact with these pages can you see the specific reasons &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; they flail. That&amp;#x27;s where session replay steps in—you can observe directly what&amp;#x27;s causing the poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; Use quantitative reports to identify opportunities and then use FullStory to see what&amp;#x27;s working—or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Make sure your paid search is paying off&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory makes it easy to search for and watch sessions of users who arrived to your site by paid search. As you watch users&amp;#x27; step-by-step progress, you&amp;#x27;ll be able to see the reasons why they convert—or why they bounce. You can refine your search results to investigate a specific action or outcome, such as form abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For one of Dana&amp;#x27;s clients, session replay revealed that users were actually filling out the form, but then hitting a &lt;code&gt;Download PDF&lt;/code&gt; button instead of &lt;code&gt;Submit&lt;/code&gt;. These kind of nuanced behaviors around user experience are hard to understand via traditional analytics but easy to see in FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whatever is happening to prevent conversions, zooming in on user behaviors with replay will help you provide much-needed context around conversion numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; Search your sessions for those that arrive from paid channels. Make sure your most expensive visits are optimized so your investment doesn&amp;#x27;t go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Deal with your rage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One of most helpful ways to focus your attention in in FullStory is by searching for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/a&gt;: the instances when a user clicks repeatedly and rapidly in frustration, which serves as a signal something isn&amp;#x27;t working like it should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider this cringeworthy example of a customer having a disastrous time trying to select their seat at a client&amp;#x27;s concert hall site. They click everywhere as they try to select a seat, their frustration mounting, but nothing works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As painful as this session replay is to watch, it helped Dana&amp;#x27;s team get to the bottom of the problem: a bug with the ticketing software that the concert hall used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; Sessions that include frustration signals are likely opportunities for quick wins. Search your FullStory sessions for Rage Clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Check the browser/OS combo&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another easy report to generate in Google Analytics is the conversion rate for each combination of browser and operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From there, simply search in FullStory by browser and OS to bring up session replays for your lowest-performing combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you watch these session replays, patterns will emerge that can help you explain what&amp;#x27;s causing the low conversions: e.g., perhaps the site loads slowly or the content is cut off. Whatever the case may be, you can begin formulating your plan to improve the experience for these users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; It&amp;#x27;s easy to forget that not everyone has the same experience of your site as you do, particularly when it comes to devices and operating systems. Use GA to see the most popular configurations and then turn to FullStory to learn more about how those configurations are changing the user experience on your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5 bonus conversion audit hacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory is a conversion audit Swiss Army knife, but what other tools should you keep in your bag of tricks? Dana shares her top five:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. What happens when you call?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can have a best-in-class online brand presence, but it will all be for naught if your customer service is poor. What happens when you pick up the phone and call your customer support line? What&amp;#x27;s the experience like? Are you treated in a way that aligns with your brand identity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dana shares an unfortunate example of a window manufacturing client whose installation team consistently received harsh reviews for their customer service, undermining the brand experience other stakeholders worked so diligently to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One call—that&amp;#x27;s all it might take to identify customer service problems that need your attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. When did you last crawl your site?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A few regularly scheduled tune-ups will help make sure your site gives your customers a smooth ride. Dana recommends periodically using a site crawler tool such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepcrawl.com/&quot;&gt;DeepCrawl&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/&quot;&gt;Screaming Frog&lt;/a&gt; to check for broken links and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Also pay special attention to your key landing pages, and check that you don&amp;#x27;t have featured holiday or seasonal content that&amp;#x27;s no longer relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Have you tried an ad blocker?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many of your more computer-savvy customers probably have an ad blocker installed. Do you know what your site looks like with one enabled? Try using an ad blocker to see if your site still works correctly and your key marketing messages are still visible for these users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Which results would you click?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The conversion funnel often starts on the search results page, before potential customers even get to your site.

You’re practically drowning in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yet you still fight to find the insights you actually need. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Product leaders at eCommerce and SaaS Companies of all sizes have shared with us how they’ve struggled, knowing the insights they need are there in the data … if only they could find them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We have lots of data, but it’s a blessing and a curse … because we haven’t yet figured out how to use the data proactively instead of reactively.”  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Most analytics tools can’t tell me why conversions dropped unless I’ve instrumented every possible reason as an event.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We&amp;#x27;ve got a long list of issues—all problems we need to fix. However, we struggle to find a way to prioritize them. What&amp;#x27;s going to move the needle?”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hearing comments like these we realized two things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;One&lt;/b&gt;, FullStory is uniquely positioned to solve these kinds of problems. For our customers, we already store and organize all the digital experience data available. This data is comprehensive—second to none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two&lt;/b&gt;, having all the digital experience data can only get you so far: our customers still need a way to isolate the signal from the noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So we got to work. What if we could use machine learning to cut through the noise of all that data? What if FullStory could take your desired outcomes—i.e. purchase completion, account creation, user onboarding—and then look for connections between those outcomes and the actual experiences of real users?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You know, have FullStory find the answers in all that data for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We built &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/conversions/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conversions by FullStory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to do just that. Now, FullStory can analyze all your digital experience data, looking for the precise factors that correlate with users failing to achieve the outcomes you care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Conversions makes it easier to distill user behavior insights and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;uncover the needle in the haystack&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; we couldn’t always find!”&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;– Brit Tucker, Director of Product Management, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beautycounter.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beautycounter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our Conversions product is built to do the heavy lifting for you—to give you all the answers you need to move fast and take definitive action to improve your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s a 2-minute overview showing how Conversions works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How Conversions by FullStory Finds Answers For You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We know that your user flows, your most important metrics ... &lt;i&gt;your business&lt;/i&gt; is unique. That’s why Conversions by FullStory is fully customizable to find the answers you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s how it works. You tell FullStory what you care about—the funnels or flows, user cohorts, and time range—and Conversions will get to work looking at what real users do &lt;i&gt;or don’t do&lt;/i&gt; along that path. Then, Conversions will highlight opportunities prioritized based on the severity of impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversions looks at frustration signals, performance impacts, and anything that&amp;#x27;s instrumented (like your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/custom-events-in-fullstory/&quot;&gt;Custom Events&lt;/a&gt;). You can edit Conversions however and whenever you want, so it’s easy to learn, iterate, and improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For each opportunity, FullStory provides an Opportunity Analysis view. This report summarizes the problem, provides a Funnel Analysis that reveals where in the customer journey a problem is occurring, and important details about how affected users compare to unaffected users. It’s just what you need to know to understand when and how a problem actually impacts your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From what to why and back again&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Knowing what to pay attention to will take you a long way. But if your site or app isn’t performing as expected—and customers are getting stuck at a critical step toward conversion—you need to know &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here, Conversions leverages the power of FullStory’s session replay. Replay gives you the context you need to shift from knowing what’s important to knowing what to do about it. It&amp;#x27;s the “ground truth” that settles bets, builds consensus, and motivates action. You’ll find replay ready and waiting with every analysis in Conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a single place, our Conversions product shows you what happened and why—so you can confidently know exactly what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Move faster from friction to fixing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We know what product leaders need isn’t more data—it’s timely, powerful answers they can act on immediately and with confidence ... knowing they’re working on what’s most important for their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re ready to take the leap from digital experience to digital &lt;i&gt;smarts&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/conversions/&quot;&gt;request a demo of Conversions by FullStory today&lt;/a&gt;—it&amp;#x27;s now available in the enterprise edition of FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We can’t wait to show it to you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[3 ways to get closer to your customers with FullStory + Survicate]]></title><description><![CDATA[Explore our native, code-free (and free of charge) integration with the versatile customer feedback tool, Survicate.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/3-ways-to-get-closer-to-your-customers</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/3-ways-to-get-closer-to-your-customers</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Amy Ellis]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer needs can change at the drop of a hat for a myriad of reasons. For businesses that value customer experience, the ability to nimbly adapt to a shift in customer needs is directly related to how close you are to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That’s why today we’re excited to announce a native, code-free (and free of charge) integration with the versatile customer feedback tool, &lt;a href=&quot;https://survicate.com/&quot;&gt;Survicate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connecting FullStory and Survicate makes it easy to:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch session replays associated with the corresponding survey responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send survey responses to FullStory as events and use them as filters when searching and segmenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access users&amp;#x27; latest feedback straight from FullStory user profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The integration between Survicate and FullStory lets us figure out which flows lead to negative feedback and which lead to positive feedback. We’re now getting a full picture of customer experience and can make revenue-increasing decisions!” — Nir, Head of Product at Lusha.co&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Three steps to take right now to get closer to your customer&amp;#x27;s needs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Launch NPS and/or CSAT surveys to get a sense of your customer’s satisfaction right now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Remember that previously happy customers might be frustrated or upset &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt;. As their needs and priorities change, their experience with your site or app may also change. NPS and CSAT surveys can be a quick way to check in on how your customers and visitors are feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tips for NPS and CSAT surveys during stressful times:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take extra time with your survey copy to ensure the tone feels right given the larger context of your customers lives right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think carefully about the moment you ask for feedback. Remember that customers visiting your site may be short on time and moving quickly to accomplish their goal (whether that’s making a purchase, checking on shipping status, making a return or canceling a purchase). You don’t want your survey to get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devote extra resources to understanding negative feedback and responding—when appropriate—to get more details and/or make things right (more on that later).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analyze sessions from unhappy customers to see where you’re falling short of their expectations.&lt;/b&gt;

As feedback starts to roll in, jump into FullStory and watch sessions. Prioritize sessions from your unhappy customers and detractors first. Look for clues around their poor experience. Where are they getting stuck? Is there a bug in the experience that needs to be fixed (broken elements, slow page loads etc.)? Are they searching for information that’s not easily available?

For even more insights, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/conversions/&quot;&gt;Conversions by FullStory&lt;/a&gt; to analyze the sessions of detractors and dissatisfied customers. Let FullStory tell you which experience issues correlate with lower NPS scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Follow up with your customers to get more information and make things right.&lt;/b&gt;

If you find a set of dissatisfied customers and the cause of their frustration isn’t as clear as you’d like, launch a follow up survey or outreach campaign asking for more details. Again, think carefully about your copy here—acknowledge the negative feedback and share your interest in making things right and better serving their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You may find that the cause of some negative experience is really clear—an experience bug like slow page loads or a broken button might have derailed your customer’s progress and led to frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you fix the issue, follow up with affected customers. (You can build a segment in FullStory to find everyone who encountered that problem, even if they didn’t complete a survey.) Then, launch an outreach campaign to proactively let them know that the issue has been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your follow up survey reveals a change in customer needs—for example customers may be looking for better visibility into shipping status or a way to know when out of stock items are back in stock—you can make the required shifts to better meet these needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Don’t forget to let your customers know that you have received their feedback and are working on a solution. Nothing helps assuage customer frustration more than feeling heard and knowing that you value their needs enough to make a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Removing the barriers between you and your customers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get free access to Survicate Ultimate for 30 days.&lt;/b&gt;

experience issues when a product feature isn&amp;#x27;t &amp;quot;working as designed&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bugs happen. Software breaks. And whether it triggers an error notification or gets reported by a customer, bugs inspire valorous responses from engineers who rise up to squash and conquer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sometimes bugs aren’t so obvious. Apart from functional bugs—that is, bugs where the product is clearly broken—what about those more nuanced user experience issues that don&amp;#x27;t necessarily throw errors in the console? What do you do when you catch something—an issue with the user experience—that &lt;i&gt;feels&lt;/i&gt; broken but might actually be &amp;quot;Working as Designed?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s time to call a spade a spade. UX issues are bugs, and they should be treated as such. The only catch is that, unlike a functional bug, the &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; for a UX bug is often undefined. With a functional bug, you have a design doc to reference the way it should work when it&amp;#x27;s fixed. With a UX bug, you need to go further to classify the problem, triage the work, and discover the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That&amp;#x27;s where FullStory can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this article, we&amp;#x27;ll walk you through a tried-and-true, repeatable process for handling digital user experience issues that&amp;#x27;s suitable for any product team.

The form itself is functionally fine, but the error message on the returning user sign-in form doesn&amp;#x27;t match up with the expected customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because the customer experience doesn&amp;#x27;t match customer expectations, classify this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;data point&lt;/a&gt; as a UX bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, while in FullStory, hit &amp;quot;pause&amp;quot; on the session at the time of the UX bug and click &amp;quot;Note and share&amp;quot; to open the annotation feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Try to describe the issue exactly as you see it, holding back any thoughts or feelings which could color the evidence with your take on the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bad note:&lt;/b&gt; Yikes! This is weird. Whoever wrote this error message totally goofed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good note:&lt;/b&gt; Customer sees error message &amp;quot;Error setting password&amp;quot; which is unexpected because they&amp;#x27;re logging in, not signing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that that&amp;#x27;s done, you&amp;#x27;ve got a piece of data and a starting point for a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Get the bug in the queue where it belongs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/capture-bugs-like-fireflies-in-a-jar-with-fullstory-for-jira&quot;&gt;FullStory integrated with JIRA&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;#x27;s gold. You can take the Note you just made in FullStory, click &amp;quot;Create Share Link,&amp;quot; and then &amp;quot;Send to JIRA&amp;quot; to push the bug directly into your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Or if you need to follow a slightly more controlled process, here&amp;#x27;s what we recommend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &amp;quot;Report a bug&amp;quot; from your Note in the event stream or from the Notes page in FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click Copy to grab your note plus all of the other relevant details engineering might want for replication (viewport, browser, IP, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open a ticket in your system of choice (for me, that&amp;#x27;s Clubhouse) and paste the details from FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, before you launch your bug report into the ether, make sure it&amp;#x27;s:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Titled clearly, using a naming pattern that will make it easy to recognize and find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Categorized as a bug (not a feature!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assigned to the right group or project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labeled or tagged appropriately, i.e. &amp;quot;ux-bug.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the right state for someone to triage and review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Again, state the facts and lean on data as a starting point for a conversation. There will be plenty of time to address thoughts and feelings &lt;i&gt;momentarily&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hit whatever big button creates a ticket in your system and you&amp;#x27;re off!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Define the desired outcome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that the UX bug you caught is filed and logged in the system, it&amp;#x27;s time to take a step back. What is the desired outcome for returning users in this state?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Continuing with our example from above, returning users should be able to log in successfully and hit their profile page on our site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So let&amp;#x27;s build a segment in FullStory to understand how many returning customers are able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Make sure to refine your search criteria to &lt;code&gt;in this order&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;within the same session&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Then, scroll down to see the &lt;b&gt;Event Funnel&lt;/b&gt; and learn what percentage of customers are able to make it all the way through to the desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Save your segment and grab a snapshot of this funnel for later. You can even attach the screenshot to your bug report ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Quantify the impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To precisely understand the impact of our example sign-in issue, we need to monitor our customer journey when the error was part of the customer digital experience. The most precise way to do this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034693073-Watched-Elements-Can-I-search-for-CSS-elements-without-a-click-event-&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;by configuring Watched Elements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to monitor who &lt;b&gt;has seen&lt;/b&gt; the error message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;(If you&amp;#x27;ve never used this feature before, you can work with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/requests/new&quot;&gt;FullStory support team&lt;/a&gt; to set it up!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With Watched Elements, you can build a copy of your funnel that specifically includes people who saw the error. If you don&amp;#x27;t have Watched Elements in FullStory enabled, you can refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-fullstory-on-funnels/&quot;&gt;your standard funnel&lt;/a&gt; and look for the drop-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So with our example from above, let&amp;#x27;s &lt;b&gt;quantify impact&lt;/b&gt;: How big is the drop-off between people who click &amp;quot;Continue&amp;quot; and actually reach the logged in state?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can figure this out by first making a copy of your funnel. Then, flip the last step to &lt;code&gt;Has not visited&lt;/code&gt; (instead of who &lt;code&gt;Has visited&lt;/code&gt;) and grab the total number of people in that segment. Compare the two. This is the impact of errors within the sign-in flow for returning customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Grab that number and attach it to your ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What&amp;#x27;s at stake in terms of your customer&amp;#x27;s journey? Again, continue with this scenario. If a returning customer doesn&amp;#x27;t overcome this error state, what critical action will they not be able to accomplish next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Returning customers who can&amp;#x27;t understand the cause of a password error will not learn how to correct the inputs of the password field. If they can&amp;#x27;t correct the password field, they can&amp;#x27;t log in. If they cannot log in, they will either:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Click &amp;quot;Forgot password?&amp;quot; and reset it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continue shopping and check out as a guest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bounce completely&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, what are the potential costs of each of these alternatives in terms of both a) the customer experience and b) actual operational cost? Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If they cannot log in, they will either:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Click &amp;quot;Forgot password?&amp;quot; and reset it&lt;/b&gt;
Experience Cost: moderately frustrating to the customer,
Operational Cost: $0.xx per reset email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continue shopping and check out as a guest&lt;/b&gt;
Experience Cost: mildly frustrating to the customer,
Operational Cost: measured KPI for $ value of checkouts from identified returning customers take a hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bounce completely&lt;/b&gt;
Experience Cost: mildly frustrating to the customer,
Operational Cost: lost opportunity of average cart size $0.xx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer frustration comes with its own intangible cost. Each frustrated customer represents potential churn and/or lost word-of-mouth marketing. Don&amp;#x27;t forget to consider the real impact of frustration on the success of your business—even a rough estimate is useful here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Also, you want to determine the total cost of any alternative paths for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Write these cost estimates down, and attach them to your bug report ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Collaborate to define the fix&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a good sense of the opportunity at hand, rally the relevant humans to define the solution. In this example scenario, we&amp;#x27;re going to need at least:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone who understands the code that&amp;#x27;s throwing the error (e.g. an Engineer or Developer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone who can design an alternative error state (e.g. a Designer and/or UX Copywriter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Start asking questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, is the error that the customer is seeing the intended error based on the specific contents of the input field in this state?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the actual contents of the input field and the technical error behind the scenes, how would we make this error message more clear and specific?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the scope of the issue, how much effort would be required to make this change? What is a reasonable amount of time that would be needed to design and code a fix?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Describe the solution (including any specific text or images as appropriate) and add all of the artifacts to your bug ticket in the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A note on exploring/suggesting solutions:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Designers are there to help you solve a problem. That&amp;#x27;s what they do. Usually, if you can describe the issue, they&amp;#x27;re going to come up with a solution that&amp;#x27;s better and more thoughtful than you could even imagine. If an issue gets stuck and isn&amp;#x27;t moving forward, it can be interesting to put forth a &lt;i&gt;mocked up&lt;/i&gt; idea proposal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can use a simple wireframing tool, Photoshop, Google Slides, or even hack the UI and take a screenshot—whatever helps paint the picture. Sometimes a strong reaction against a less than great idea is exactly what you need to get momentum going for a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. Prioritize, execute, socialize&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Depending on the agility of your organization, it&amp;#x27;s possible that at this point, someone&amp;#x27;s already picked up your request and the fix is out the door, but don&amp;#x27;t count on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Is your ticket still in the triage queue? If yes, take a deep breath. It all comes down to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Identify the right prioritization process for your UX bug resolution. Is there a weekly meeting where bugs are reviewed? Is the effort big enough that you&amp;#x27;re going to need a Product Manager partner to help champion the work? Can you sneak it into the sprint for the next cycle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Only you can know how to navigate the people and workflows in your organization. If all else fails, ask for help—preferably from someone who&amp;#x27;s been able to get their own &amp;quot;wish list&amp;quot; items prioritized before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, once your request gets prioritized for development, &lt;b&gt;don&amp;#x27;t walk away!&lt;/b&gt; Like your golf swing, follow through matters with UX bugs. Once your fix goes live, be sure to revisit your FullStory segments and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;replay sessions&lt;/a&gt; so you can research and analyze results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Circle back to your original funnel. Did you move the needle? Calculate the total impact and multiply that by the associated cost you defined. How&amp;#x27;d you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Win or lose, this is your opportunity to share the story. Grab one of the original sessions that contained the UX bug. Quantify the results. Put together a narrative with feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re not sure where to start, here&amp;#x27;s a little narrative template you can use to get the ball rolling:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you share your story by dropping a summary into a Slack channel or presenting at the weekly all-hands meeting, make sure you get heard. When you&amp;#x27;re able to tell stories that connect your coworkers with your customer experience, those UX bugs stop feeling so much like &amp;quot;bugs&amp;quot; and more like opportunities to win as a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The qualitative + quantitative digital experience flywheel]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here's how you can quantitatively analyze your qualitative digital experience data to unlock an entirely new workflow.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin Owings]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quantitatively&lt;/i&gt; analyze your &lt;i&gt;qualitative&lt;/i&gt; digital experience data to create a virtuous cycle for digital product improvements.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Understanding how people interact with your website, app, or digital product is hard. You can have all the user data in the world but no idea what to do with it, no process to manage it, and no way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/finding-dxi-signals-through-the-noise&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;filter the signal from the noise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Where do you even start? And once you begin, where do you go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Data saturation is everywhere. We’ve often had the belief that more is better; however, that actually isn’t true in the case of data. The rapid rise in our ability to collect data hasn’t been matched by our ability to support, filter and manage the data. [We have] too much data with not enough structure in place to manage the data and not enough meaningful application.”

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/analyze-digital-experience-data&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quantitative analysis of digital experience data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; puts everything in terms of numbers.&lt;/b&gt; The number of users clicking a button, bounce rates, time on site, and more. Quantitative research is a clean way to crunch numbers and understand what’s going on at a high level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
The drawback to &lt;a href=&quot;/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantitative data&lt;/a&gt; is that much can be lost in translation. Important nuances missed and in that absence of information like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/review-user-sessions&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reviewing user sessions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the quantitative can play tricks on our pattern-recognizing brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is qualitative analysis?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To really understand &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; happens on your website, app, or web application, you also need to understand &lt;i&gt;why &lt;/i&gt;users took certain actions. And that&amp;#x27;s where the second approach comes in—the qualitative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Qualitative analysis focuses on the subjective qualities of your users&lt;/b&gt;—the nuanced actions that drive the numbers. It&amp;#x27;s descriptive research. The qualitative approach is subjective, too. The user paused here. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rage Clicked there&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They seem confused with this UI—what&amp;#x27;s going on? Qualitative data is messy. But it is rich in insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The major problem with qualitative research methods is that they occur at the individual level. Qualitatively researching every user who visits your site is impossible. You could never do it, nor would it be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best analyses combine quantitative and qualitative research to create a flywheel of continuous product improvement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what do you do? &lt;b&gt;Use both.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Collectively, quantitative and qualitative analysis is the backbone of &lt;a href=&quot;/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The best analyses combine quantitative and qualitative research to create a flywheel of continuous product improvement. You use quantitative information to focus attention on the biggest problems (and opportunities) and then &amp;quot;zoom in&amp;quot; to the level of the user through qualitative research to round out your understanding—and solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This one-two research method spins out insights you can turn into actions. It&amp;#x27;s a quantitative-qualitative flywheel that can be used for continuous improvement of your website or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s the 3-step process:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Quantitative data alerts you to problems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The most basic web analytics tools available are quantitative—and free. It comes as no surprise that one of the first things web site owners do on launching a new site is install &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623414-Google-Analytics-Universal&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Traditional quantitative analytics tools like Google Analytics do a reliable job providing high-level metrics—such as user info, page visits, events, conversion rates, bounce rates, and time on site. Most importantly, they allow you to see the status of different aspects of your site and help you focus on problems or opportunities in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a functional quantitative analytics tool up and running, you&amp;#x27;re ready to identify issues and opportunities for improvement. This is a great place to put in motion a quantitative-qualitative flywheel—though as you&amp;#x27;ll see in this article, once you have the flywheel going, it&amp;#x27;s not the only place to begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you only have a quantitative tool tracking your customer data, it is easy to be dazzled by the illusion of insights. Come at your newfound quantitative data powers with an objective to avoid becoming overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider these changes in quantitative metrics that left team&amp;#x27;s struggling to understand the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; behind the quantitative &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in customer churn seen by Wistia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-wistias-growth-team-uses-fullstory-to-run-experiments&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;couldn&amp;#x27;t be explained or reproduced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Why were customers churning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A drop in conversions like the car insurance company Metromile saw when &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/session-replay-helps-metromile-grow-revenue/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;users started quote requests on their site but then left them unfinished&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Why weren’t users completing the form?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decreased usage of certain features, like the customer service software company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-kayako-used-fullstory-to-boost-feature-adoption-and-reduce-churn&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kayako saw on analyzing feature adoption&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Why weren&amp;#x27;t customers trying out new features?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased page bounces, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/three-ux-tweaks-spanishdict-found-using-fullstory-to-improve-retention/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;seen by the translation service SpanishDict&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on on their homepage. What was breaking at the moment of first engagement?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Remember: behind every quantitative metric is a real person trying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;get some job done&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You have to understand what your users and customers are trying to accomplish to smooth out the digital experience—and quantitative information can’t show you the nuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To figure out what jobs they want to get done, you need to build out the next step in the flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Qualitative data gives you the w&lt;i&gt;hy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having used quantitative analysis to identify problems that require additional analysis, you need a way to &amp;quot;zoom in&amp;quot; on individual user behavior. That&amp;#x27;s why you need a qualitative analytics tool alongside a quantitative one: for total digital experience intelligence (DXI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;Qualitative data&lt;/a&gt; can provide you with a ton of nuanced information about individual user behaviors. It&amp;#x27;s the most dense level of data. It&amp;#x27;s the kind of data you get with &lt;a href=&quot;https://mopinion.com/quantitative-vs-qualitative-online-customer-feedback/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;open-ended feedback&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—and also what you get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;through session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Using a qualitative analytics tool, you can see how individual users interact with your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;So how does it work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do you go from quantitative data to qualitative research? Using &lt;u&gt;a digital experience intelligence platform&lt;/u&gt; like FullStory, you can search the entire catalog of user behaviors on your site for just those that would affect whatever quantitative data you&amp;#x27;re researching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Continuing from our company examples above, qualitative data was used to uncover the why behind the change in quantitative data:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rage clicking indicated to Wistia that much of their customer churn was caused by confusion about how to use the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confused site navigation on Metromile&amp;#x27;s online dashboard showed the company that users didn&amp;#x27;t understand the value of their pay-per-mile model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observing that most users skipped onboarding shed a light on why Kayako users didn&amp;#x27;t know about certain features or couldn&amp;#x27;t figure out how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the site layout from the user&amp;#x27;s perspective helped SpanishDict see that users couldn&amp;#x27;t figure out how to get started because a banner ad was blocking the search bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In each of the above cases, qualitative research (completed using FullStory) provided the additional insights necessary to make sense of the problems identified through other quantitative tools. Collectively, that’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/how-to-choose-a-dx-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital experience intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having used qualitative research to understand why you&amp;#x27;re seeing changes in quantitative data, it&amp;#x27;s time for action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Experiment and check for improvements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Armed with a complete view of the user from the individual to the aggregate, you now have the insight you need to do something, and that something is to make edits and run experiments. This is the last step in the quantitative-qualitative flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Just what edits are required will vary greatly depending on the problem you&amp;#x27;re solving. Make the edits, run the experiments (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-to-use-session-replay-for-conversion-rate-optimization&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;A/B testing is helpful here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and then measure your results. You&amp;#x27;re back at the top of the flywheel, and on and on we go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Take what you’ve learned and begin again&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rather than qualitative vs. quantitative, the most clever analysts use the two together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Quantitatively identifying problems in aggregate and qualitatively understanding the underlying behaviors behind those problems has become a critical workflow (that, as you guessed, works in both directions!) that drives product improvements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Wistia, user confusion about how to use the product was reduced through allocating additional resources to customer support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metromile realized that they needed to add educational content to their homepage to reduce user confusion and encourage more quote requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kayako learned that they needed to overhaul their user onboarding, and designed a completely new onboarding flow to guide users through the part of the product they were most interested in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SpanishDict increased engagement by moving the ad banner that was blocking the search bar to optimize for mobile users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ultimately, this results in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/feedback-loop-optimization-strategies&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;product feedback loop&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The quantitative-qualitative flywheel ensures your brain will never have to scramble to fill in gaps. The best qualitative and quantitative analytics tools work together to reveal the full story of user behavior on your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Put the flywheel to work and reap the rewards of an improved &lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence platform&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Clay Christensen's Jobs to Be Done framework: How to build better products ]]></title><description><![CDATA[What is the Jobs to Be Done framework?

What is the job to be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you can solve the mystery of Jobs to Be Done, you can build the kind of products people love ... like milkshakes for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do you satisfy your hunger on your commute?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Professor Christensen told a wonderful story to illustrate the Jobs to Be Done concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It starts with a fast food company’s attempt to make a better milkshake. The fast food company took a classic approach. They identified their target milkshake-slurping demographic and sent researchers to analyze this audience&amp;#x27;s milkshake preferences. Unfortunately, once the fast food company began making new, evidence-backed and &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; milkshakes based on the research findings, they discovered milkshake sales didn&amp;#x27;t improve, at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What went wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This milkshake story is so good and so well told by Christensen, it&amp;#x27;s worth the four minutes it takes to hear the late Professor tell the story (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/sfGtw2C95Ms?t=41s&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;; alternatively, read the transcript of the milkshake story included below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Clayton Christensen&amp;#x27;s milkshake mystery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We actually hire products to do things for us. And understanding what job we have to do in our lives for which we would hire a product is really the key to cracking this problem of motivating customers to buy what we’re offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So I wanted just to tell you a story about a project we did for one of the big fast food restaurants. They were trying to goose up the sales of their milkshakes. They had just studied this problem up the gazoo. They brought in customers who fit the profile of the quintessential milkshake consumer. They’d give them samples and ask, “Could you tell us how we could improve our milkshakes so you’d buy more of them? Do you want it chocolate-ier, cheaper, chunkier, or chewier?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They’d get very clear feedback and they’d improve the milkshake on those dimensions and it had no impact on sales or profits whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So one of our colleagues went in with a different question on his mind. And that was, “I wonder what job arises in people’s lives that cause them to come to this restaurant to hire a milkshake?” We stood in a restaurant for 18 hours one day and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;just took very careful data&lt;/a&gt;. What time did they buy these milkshakes? What were they wearing? Were they alone? Did they buy other food with it? Did they eat it in the restaurant or drive off with it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It turned out that nearly half of the milkshakes were sold before 8 o’clock in the morning. The people who bought them were always alone. It was the only thing they bought and they all got in the car and drove off with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To figure out what job they were trying to hire it to do, we came back the next day and stood outside the restaurant so we could confront these folks as they left milkshake-in-hand. And in language that they could understand we essentially asked, “Excuse me please but I gotta sort this puzzle out. What job were you trying to do for yourself that caused you to come here and hire that milkshake?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They’d struggle to answer so we then helped them by asking other questions like, “Well, think about the last time you were in the same situation needing to get the same job done but you didn’t come here to hire a milkshake. What did you hire?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And then as we put all their answers together it became clear that they all had the same job to be done in the morning. That is that they had a long and boring drive to work and they just needed something to do while they drove to keep the commute interesting. One hand had to be on the wheel but someone had given them another hand and there wasn’t anything in it. And they just needed something to do when they drove. They weren’t hungry yet but they knew they would be hungry by 10 o’clock so they also wanted something that would just plunk down there and stay for their morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christensen paraphrasing the commuting milkshake buyer:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Good question. What do I hire when I do this job? You know, I’ve never framed the question that way before, but last Friday I hired a banana to do the job. Take my word for it. Never hire bananas. They’re gone in three minutes — you’re hungry by 7:30am. If you promise not to tell my wife I probably hire donuts twice a week, but they don’t do it well either. They’re gone fast. They crumb all over my clothes. They get my fingers gooey.Sometimes I hire bagels but as you know they’re so dry and tasteless. Then I have to steer the car with my knees while I’m putting jam on it and if the phone rings we got a crisis. I remember I hired a Snickers bar once but I felt so guilty I’ve never hired Snickers again. Let me tell you when I hire this milkshake it is so viscous that it easily takes me 20 minutes to suck it up through that thin little straw. Who cares what the ingredients are — I don’t. All I know is I’m full all morning and it fits right here in my cupholder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christensen concludes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Well it turns out that the milkshake does the job better than any of the competitors, which in the customer’s minds are not Burger King milkshakes but bananas, donuts, bagels, Snickers bars, coffee, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I hope you can see how if you understand the job, how to improve the product becomes just obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Source:&lt;/i&gt; Clayton Christensen, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/sfGtw2C95Ms?t=41s&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Let me tell you when I hire this milkshake it is so viscous that it easily takes me 20 minutes to suck it up through that thin little straw.

Are milkshake buyers little more than their demographics? Of course not. &amp;quot;Demographic determinism&amp;quot; leads us to a dead end because demographics fail to predict intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And in this case, confusing the milkshake consumers with &lt;i&gt;what they hope to do&lt;/i&gt; (Satisfy hunger, add excitement to a boring commute, or whatever they hope to accomplish), will result in developing “a one-size-fits-none product,” as Christensen put it. Worse, you can bet this product will do little to nothing for sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, a business organized around solving for the actual needs of consumers has a clear reason for being because it’s those needs that drive a customer’s behavior in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Remember: The consumer is not the same as what they consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s all about intent! And intent starts with empathy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Christensen&amp;#x27;s Jobs to Be Done framework brings to our attention something we all know: intent matters. Everyone has reasons for the choices they make—a need to meet, desire to fulfill, objective in mind, &lt;i&gt;whatever&lt;/i&gt;! Shakespeare captured this quintessential insight about human nature some 400 years ago while writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/full.html&quot;&gt;Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;: “Though this be madness yet there is method in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to be effective at &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; job, you need to identify &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; job. You have to discover what need, desire, or objective &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; hope to satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finding the method behind the madness—that is, the intent of the customer—begins with empathy. Whether you&amp;#x27;re a product manager, a support professional, a salesperson, marketer, whatever, if you want to be effective at &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; job, you need to identify &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; job. You have to discover what need, desire, or objective &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; hope to satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Empathy grounds us with a deep understanding of the customer&amp;#x27;s mind, putting us in that mindset so we can discover intent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And when it comes to lovable products and customer experiences, you must direct that empathetic understanding toward solving for that intent. And you have to do it better than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is why it&amp;#x27;s so important to question whether the features we&amp;#x27;re building or product branches we&amp;#x27;re developing will do the job better than the nearest alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because if the product being developed is built without customer needs in focus, you might find we’ve developed the most amazing product ... only it&amp;#x27;ll be one that no one wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!&amp;quot; —Theodore Levitt, Harvard Business Professor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using Jobs to Be Done to build more perfect products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can only find the right answer if you ask the right question.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So now you&amp;#x27;ve got a firm grasp on Jobs to Be Done. How do you put it to work? How do you tap into empathy and discover customer intent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Applying JTBD to understand consumer needs can be as simple as asking, “What did you turn to the last time you needed to do this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In Clay Christensen’s milkshake story, this question helped consumers to think back on a previous time they were in the same situation and needed that specific job done. That is, the milkshake buyer needed something to satiate their hunger—or their boredom—on their long commute to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It sounds so easy, except we all know how hard it can be to uncover &lt;i&gt;exactly what jobs&lt;/i&gt; a customer needs doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Which is why we&amp;#x27;ve put together a handful of questions you can ask that can help reveal clues to solve the JTBD mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. The switching question—&amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re Fired!&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Is your product so good that your audience would ‘fire’ their current product in order to hire yours?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reflect on the product you “fired” before hiring the current product. You can tease out why customers choose your product or service by considering what the customer used before they switched to your product. From there, thinking about the “why” can help clarify just what job needs doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The “fired” lens in the Jobs to Be Done framework can be used to understand how many once-successful businesses were displaced by competitors that simply did the job better. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netflix doing the job of Blockbuster — “I need something to entertain me ... but I don&amp;#x27;t want to work too hard to find it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uber, Lyft replacing taxis — “I need to get from point A to point B easily and painlessly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google — “I need to know ______ and I&amp;#x27;m only willing to work so hard to find the answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon — “I need to have ______ and I don&amp;#x27;t want to overpay for a product I&amp;#x27;m not confident I&amp;#x27;ll like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smartphones — “I need _____” ... Truly smartphones are a JTBD powerhouse, fueling all kinds of businesses over the last 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ask this critical question: “Is my product (or service) so good that my intended customer will stop using the product and make the switch?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What are people going to stop doing once they start using your product?” — Jason Fried, &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/what-is-someone-going-to-stop-doing-when-they-start-using-your-product-39f3f7a20c37#.do7cujcmn&quot;&gt;Signal vs. Noise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Remember: If you can’t answer the “switching jobs” question clearly, could you reasonably expect a potential customer to?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. The &amp;quot;WWYSYDH&amp;quot; question&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What does your product or service actually do for the customer?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’ve seen office space, you certainly remember when “the Bobs” asked our slacker protagonist a simple question: “What would you say you do here?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This simple, straight-to-the-point question deserves some focused attention. If you articulate all the things the product &lt;i&gt;actually does&lt;/i&gt; for a customer, you will paint an impression that will help you tease apart what job it is your customer is trying to get done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Be both specific and general. The details matter more than you might think. The drill makes holes. The milkshake gives you food &lt;i&gt;and it takes awhile to drink&lt;/i&gt;. Starbucks gives you energy &lt;i&gt;and it also gives you a place to go&lt;/i&gt;. Make a WWYSYDH list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Contrast your list with the product’s enumerated features. Do the features your product developed solve for the things on your list — the things your customers need doing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re struggling here, you might also try &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys&quot;&gt;The 5 Whys&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re unfamiliar, this approach is simply asking and answering “Why?” where each answer you provide is further challenged by asking, “Why?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. The hierarchy of needs question&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Remember Maslow&amp;#x27;s hierarchy of needs? How does your product fill these needs?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now it&amp;#x27;s time to go up a level. Think about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs&quot;&gt;Maslow’s hierarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt;. Christensen has written that, “With few exceptions, every job people need or want to do has a social, a functional, and an emotional dimension.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What social need does the product solve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What emotional need is being solved by the product?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will using the product make the customer feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While it may seem far-fetched to think of how a given product solves some intangible need of a customer, it makes sense: customers buy products for &lt;i&gt;reasons&lt;/i&gt; (see above) that exist under specific circumstances (context). These reasons can be simple or incredibly complex. Meanwhile, because most of us don&amp;#x27;t question the underlying reasons for why we do the things we do, understanding how our behaviors satisfy our basic needs as human beings can be exceptionally difficult to articulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is why the Jobs to Be Done framework can be extended to understand all sorts of things about others and yourself — from your career choices to your hobbies and relationships. You can ask yourself, “Why am I really doing ______? What is it I really hope to accomplish here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Apply the Jobs to be Done framework introspectively and you may be surprised what you find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Build more perfect products with Jobs to Be Done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that you&amp;#x27;re well-versed in the Jobs to Be Done framework, take a second to look at your product roadmap.

Because it actually made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“I mean, I was trapped in my apartment—like everyone else. And I’d watch Governor Cuomo talk every morning. Hearing him say, day after day, ‘&lt;i&gt;today is worse than yesterday…&lt;/i&gt;’ It lit something in me. This motivation to figure out what we could do to help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Gaviria is the head of user experience and part of the product strategy team at Thomas, a B2B marketplace connecting industrial buyers with industrial suppliers. Several weeks ago, as demand for so many products was dropping off a cliff, while demand for critical healthcare products was skyrocketing, he realized that Thomas was perfectly positioned to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Spotting a product opportunity and making moves, quickly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“One of my coworkers on the agency side of our business told me that a client was having to shut down their manufacturing facility entirely. I put two and two together and knew that this was going to happen to a ton of facilities that were seeing a major decline in demand for what they make,” explains Gaviria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fortunately, Julian and his team had already been conceptualizing an SOS system that would help direct buyers to critical suppliers in a disaster moment, exactly like the COVID-19 crisis. He took to the company’s product strategy Slack channel. He explained how this system could help prevent manufacturing facilities shutting down in large numbers because of shifts in demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Gaviria knew that the company would have to release this system as quickly as possible to actually make an impact for suppliers and buyers in need. Speed was critical. He knew he needed to escalate the conversation. At 8pm on a Friday night, he got on the phone with the company’s CEO and CTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaviria knew that the company would have to release this system as quickly as possible to actually make an impact for suppliers and buyers in need. Speed was critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“The narrative was straight-forward. If all of these manufacturers and distributors start shutting down in large numbers, we will end up with a platform of companies that are useless to buyers. We need to surface the companies that are still operating and make that &lt;i&gt;extremely obvious to users.&lt;/i&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By the end of that call, Julian had a green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ready, set, go: From idea to realized digital experience in one week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That Saturday morning, Gaviria gathered key stakeholders from product, engineering, and marketing services to brainstorm ideas. They needed to identify the companies that were still operating–that were already manufacturing critical products or that were able to switch gears to start manufacturing critical products—and make them highly visible to buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Our marketing team had simultaneously created a COVID-19 resource hub, which had an open-ended form where suppliers could ask questions. And the majority of the questions coming through were along the lines of, ‘&lt;i&gt;we have a huge facility, we can make x, y, and z related to this crisis—how can we help?’&lt;/i&gt; This became an incredibly helpful starting point for us to identify suppliers that were able to manufacture critical products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ideas in hand, Julian gathered more members of the team together on Monday to finalize their approach and strategy. By Thursday, he had a product definition, which detailed their plan to add badges to company profiles to indicate that a supplier is “actively providing products, materials, or services specific to the mass shortage of critical supplies”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The product strategy team approved the plan that day and the engineering team worked through the weekend to ship it. “By the following Monday, we had badges live on the site for any type of industrial manufacturer that was able to provide products, materials, or services specific to the COVID-19 crisis &lt;i&gt;or &lt;/i&gt;was able to pivot their business to help out with the crisis,” says Gaviria, shaking his head slightly in appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And the system is working. “We began to get emails almost daily from manufacturers that were likely going to shut down but because of the visibility they gained on our platform, they were able to stay open &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; provide critical supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“One company, for example, was able to manufacture N95 masks. But they weren’t getting orders because they don’t normally manufacture them. But as soon as they were able to get the badge on Thomasnet and validation from our supplier content team, orders started coming. The badges allowed them to show that they were credible to hospitals and government agencies,” explains Julian, grinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A couple of weeks later, two U.S. Senators sent an email to the United States manufacturing caucus, recommending Thomas as a top resource because of this system. “That was very very exciting to see,” says Julian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The digital of it all: How did Thomas make this system work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While Julian was able to connect the right teams and people to move this effort forward, his team needed to make sure the actual execution was flawless. Stakes were high and the company was moving quickly. They needed to be confident that the digital experience would be functional and seamless. That it would actually help people find what they were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thomasnet.com serves the two different sides of the industrial audience: buyers looking for suppliers and suppliers looking to be discovered by buyers. As mentioned, the marketing team had launched a COVID-19 resource hub for manufacturers. With the new badges, there was now a category specific to COVID-19 suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Our goal was to generate as much awareness as possible within the site of these two areas where you could go to meet crisis-specific needs—we wanted to funnel traffic to these two places,” explains Julian. “The more visibility and engagement, the greater the likelihood that suppliers and buyers in need could find each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To do this, the team introduced several elements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A global notification banner highlighting manufacturers and suppliers providing critical medical supplies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A global footer banner for manufacturers looking for resources and how to help (which would take them to the COVID-19 resource hub)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A component on the homepage that surfaces 4 different suppliers at a time from the COVID-19 category&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A component on the COVID-19 category that points suppliers that can manufacture critical products directly to a listing form&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To ensure these experiences were as optimized as possible, from messaging to placement to imagery, the UX team was A/B testing constantly using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.optimizely.com/&quot;&gt;Optimizely&lt;/a&gt; and FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“FullStory is deeply ingrained into our optimization process,” says Julian. “It’s integrated with Optimizely, which allows us to see both the respective A/B test and variation that a user is bucketed into along with a link to a replay of the user’s session.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“With every test we ran, we would jump into FullStory to watch how users engaged with each variation. Being able to launch a test and immediately see how it’s working—whether users are behaving as we predicted—has helped us move extremely quickly. Within those two weeks, we probably ran more tests than we have in the past three months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The things we’re able to catch and fix–the bugs, the confusion, the friction–I know this experience we’ve built wouldn’t exist today without FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Personally, I would just watch general sessions in FullStory to see how the whole thing was working. The things we’re able to catch and fix–the bugs, the confusion, the friction–I know this experience we’ve built wouldn’t exist today without FullStory,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pivoting in crisis and caring for customers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The team at Thomas was able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/deliver-value-now-boost-customer-loyalty/&quot;&gt;pivot quickly to meet their user’s needs &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There are now over 1,700 suppliers producing critical supplies—such as N95 masks, ventilators, and more—listed on Thomasnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Manufacturers that would’ve had to close have been able to keep their doors open. Healthcare facilities in dire need are getting supplies they wouldn’t have had access to. All because the team at Thomas got close to their users, they saw a pressing need, they moved with urgency, and they committed to optimizing the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Can your company help provide critical supplies during COVID-19? &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.thomasnet.com/lp-covid-19-response/?navsource=ft&quot;&gt;Let Thomas know.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Are you a buyer looking for products, materials, or other manufacturing services specific to the current shortage of critical supplies? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thomasnet.com/nsearch.html?cov=NA&amp;amp;heading=97010359&amp;amp;navsource=gnb&quot;&gt;View a list of 1,700+ suppliers here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Digital or bust: CEO at digital-first brand, Pirate Ship, on the future of commerce]]></title><description><![CDATA[In part III of our digital transformation series, the CEO at Pirate Ship shares digital lessons learned and his perspective on the future of commerce.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/future-is-digital/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/future-is-digital/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Natasha Wahid]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2020 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article summary: &lt;/b&gt;In the final post in our series on strategic digital transformation, we hear from Bjorn Borstelmann, CEO at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pirateship.com/&quot;&gt;Pirate Ship&lt;/a&gt;. Pirate Ship is a digital-first brand that makes shipping packages fun and cheap for small businesses, helping these businesses unlock shipping discounts they can use to stay competitive.

Shipping is the biggest expense for most businesses, because they simply don’t have the volume to negotiate better rates. Pirates make fierce negotiators, so we’ve unlocked the discounts small businesses need to compete, and pass them through for free at pirateship.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Q: What does the term “digital transformation” mean to you?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bjorn&lt;/b&gt;: The entire retail industry is moving online, and the pandemic just accelerated how fast that’s happening. Who wants to open a brick-and-mortar store anymore?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The numbers confirm Bjorn&amp;#x27;s point. See below for online shopping statistics and predictions for 2020 and beyond:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Q: Are conversations about the digital experience common at top levels within your organization?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bjorn: &lt;/b&gt;Ultimately no matter what business you’re in, what you’re really selling is a customer experience. We’ve built our entire company around delivering an experience that stands apart not only from the rest of our industry but from the rest of the world. Having your entire team aligned to that vision is critical. If anybody isn’t seeing the writing on the wall, especially at the executive level, they’re just going to distract you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Original research from FullStory further validates the importance of digital as an executive-level priority:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Q: Does your organization have clear goals for digital experience? How do these goals trickle down throughout the organization?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bjorn: &lt;/b&gt;Key performance indicators and metrics are helpful feedback tools to indicate whether you’re going in the right direction, and you should always be measuring so you can look for patterns… but to be honest, creating a good digital experience isn’t about trying to make the numbers move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You need to put yourself in your customer’s shoes and see what it’s like for them to interact with your business. Are they hitting weird roadblocks? Is it understandable for somebody who doesn’t know what they’re doing? Does it create excitement or frustration? Everybody in our company pays attention to the customer experience and we all strive to make it better every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Q: What are the most important elements of a strong digital experience strategy?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bjorn: &lt;/b&gt;The most universal idea is you should never have a customer in the middle of your experience saying, “I wonder what I need to do next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Digital experience analytics platforms—like FullStory—give your digital teams insight into how customers are interacting with your digital experience, so that you can quickly identify where customers might be experiencing confusion, why they&amp;#x27;re experiencing confusion, and how you can fix it.

We’re constantly trying new ideas to iterate our business, whether it’s new offerings, little tweaks to policies, or giant shifts behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get out of your comfort zone, there’s no new opportunities there. If we’re ever getting bored, so are our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disrupt yourself or you’ll be disrupted.

But what does the term &lt;i&gt;actually &lt;/i&gt;mean? And more importantly, how can companies make sure their digital efforts and investments gain traction and generate real business impact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a new series, we talk to three digital experts from leading agencies and brands and get their insight on how to take a strategic approach to digital transformation. This article features insights from Margaret Wise, Chief Revenue Officer at Arke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Addressing digital transformation confusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you google “digital transformation”, you’ll see headlines from big vendors, consultancies, and publications—like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/products/platform/what-is-digital-transformation/&quot;&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt;, Harvard Business Reivew, CIO, McKinsey. But contradictory definitions abound. The featured snippet from Salesforce states:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to create new — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But if you scroll a little further, a headline from Harvard Business Review claims “Digital Transformation Is Not About Technology” and a headline from CIO dubs it a “necessary disruption”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The concept of digital transformation is expansive and, because of this, it is inherently murky. Difficult to make tangible. Tough to break apart into actionable steps. But there is enormous pressure on companies to “go digital” and to embark on a digital transformation. This often leads to a lot of lip service, but not a lot of impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With more companies than ever focused on digital, evaluating technologies to power digital experiences, hiring digital talent… a natural question surfaces: Is that digital transformation &lt;i&gt;strategic&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we’ve seen firsthand what happens when companies invest in technology without a plan in place to ensure it 1) solves the right problem, 2) meets the needs of their employees, and 3) is adopted and widely used. Technology becomes shelfware, money is wasted, employees fall back into the status quo. And technology is just one piece of the transformation puzzle!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, we decided to check in with digital experts—leaders and practitioners from digital agencies as well as digital experts from successful brands—and get their practical insight on how companies can achieve legitimate digital transformation success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First up, Margaret Wise, Chief Revenue Officer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arke.com/work/&quot;&gt;Arke&lt;/a&gt;. Arke is a consultancy providing data insights, digital strategy, experience design, and marketing technology services that deliver results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The consultancy perspective: Margaret Wise, Chief Revenue Officer at Arke on strategic digital transformation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What does the term “digital transformation” mean to you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Margaret:&lt;/b&gt; I think of digital transformation as the effort to de-silo digital, moving from digital as a separate channel to digital as embedded across an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I do think there is confusion around the term for the general population. Is it about creating digital tools internally and automating processes? That&amp;#x27;s one perspective. Our clients are often thinking about “digital transformation” the same way as we do. They are trying to figure out how to go digital as part of a multi-faceted prospecting and customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What are the most important things a company should keep in mind when embarking on a digital transformation journey?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Margaret: &lt;/b&gt;It’s critical to develop your digital strategy in line with your organization’s strategic goals. Digital transformation is enormous and you can’t bite everything off at once; you’ll always have to prioritize limited resources. You need to prioritize based on your organization’s unique goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s also really important that—from day one—there is an understanding that this isn’t “set it and forget it”. Plan for continuous optimization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: How does Arke help companies define their digital priorities?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Margaret: &lt;/b&gt;We have our own methodologies, of course. These involve conducting workshops, defining the organization’s goals, identifying the tools they currently have in place and the additional capabilities they’re looking for. The result is a prescriptive roadmap that details the dependencies, the logic, and the teams that are involved at each step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If a company already has a clear digital transformation strategy in place, we’ll do a digital experience analysis to find opportunities to improve the digital experience from a performance and customer frustration perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our goal is to help our clients &lt;i&gt;operationalize digital&lt;/i&gt;. It’s not about making a single set of changes but building infrastructure to enable continuous testing, measuring, and improving—and demonstrating the impact over time as it relates to those strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not about making a single set of changes but building infrastructure to enable continuous testing, measuring, and improving—and demonstrating the impact over time as it relates to those strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What are the most common stumbling blocks you see organizations face when it comes to digital transformation?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Margaret: &lt;/b&gt;One of the biggest stumbling blocks is around ownership; companies often struggle to determine who should own digital transformation. While the “who” varies from company to company, ownership has to be at the top. It has to be a C-level driven initiative. To succeed, digital transformation needs an owner who is bought-in and can help the organization prepare for some of the inevitable disruption to the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital transformation requires dedicated human resources. When these resources are fractional in an organization, it prevents operationalization. There is also a data and analytics component. Like people, when the data is fractional and siloed, it’s difficult to measure and show impact. The key is to enable your people and your data to work in concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the next post in our series, we’ll hear the &lt;b&gt;innovator’s perspective&lt;/b&gt;. We sat down with Michael Moore, CIO / CTO at Moosejaw, a leading U.S. retailer of outdoor goods and apparel that has seen its share of digital transformation. Michael has been in senior-level roles in ecommerce and IT for the past 20 years, and has spent the last nine years overseeing all things technology at Moosejaw.

In this post, Michael discusses digital strategy, how Moosejaw fosters innovation, and the importance of C-level support to facilitate digital transformation success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;ICYMI, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/digital-transformation-strategy-arke/&quot;&gt;first post in our series&lt;/a&gt;: Margaret Wise, Chief Revenue Officer at Arke, a digital consultancy, discusses how to lay a foundation for strategic digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Company culture is a key piece of the digital transformation puzzle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The terms “customer-centricity” and “digital transformation” are often used in the same breath. Most business leaders understand that a stellar customer experience is essential in today’s world, but many struggle to &lt;i&gt;operationalize&lt;/i&gt; customer-centricity. It quickly becomes just another buzzword.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One method to make sure your company maintains focus on what your customers actually need and want is &lt;b&gt;experimentation&lt;/b&gt;—that is, continuous testing, learning, and iterating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/state-of-digital-experience-2020/&quot;&gt;original research from FullStory&lt;/a&gt;, more mature digital experience organizations are more likely to encourage testing and learning than their less mature counterparts. And they are 47% more likely to report that they actually iterate on a digital experience once it has been shipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide a digital experience that actually meets customer needs, digital leaders must be willing to put their ideas to the test. Because—most of the time—the experience that companies design is not the experience customers are seeking. 
— FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;State of Digital Experience 2020 report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A test-and-learn approach is critical to achieve customer-centricity. It asks an organization to have a constant pulse on customer feedback, pain, and behavior—and to propose and deliver customer-motivated changes quickly. Every test should get you one step closer to a more perfect customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That said, company culture must support experimentation—and for many organizations, this is a stumbling  block. A test-and-learn culture means everyone, at &lt;i&gt;every level&lt;/i&gt; in the organization, checks their ego at the door. It means that ideas can (and should) come from anywhere, as long as they are rooted in evidence. It means transparency is celebrated and encouraged, whether an idea is a winner or a loser. It means that good ideas actually get put to the test and then implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It is this test-and-learn energy that separates innovative companies from those that find themselves stuck and often left behind. In the following conversation, Michael Moore, CIO / CTO at Moosejaw shares the cultural norms and practices that help the almost 30-year-old retailer stay on the cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovation is at our core. Top to bottom. People come to Moosejaw for it. It’s a part of the fabric. 
— Michael Moore, CIO / CTO, Moosejaw&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The innovator’s perspective: Michael Moore, CIO / CTO at Moosejaw on culture and innovation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Moosejaw began as a physical retailer back in 1992—would you say you’ve gone through a digital transformation?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt;: “Digital transformation” is a never-ending chase, right? We’ve certainly been ahead—we were doing ‘responsive design’ before there was a concept for it, for example. But we’ll never be done. We’ve always tried to be cutting edge in terms of how we leverage technology at Moosejaw, and that hasn’t changed. There are so many competitors in our space, so it’s something we have to do to continue to differentiate ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Agility and innovation is key for us. We have a fairly small tech team, but we’re fast. When the business has ideas, we can usually implement them fairly quickly. We have several projects earmarked for 2021 that I can’t give too much detail on yet, but we’ll be the first in the industry to introduce some pretty neat features. So stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Do you think that ‘cutting-edge’ culture is unique to Moosejaw in your space?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt;: I don’t think it’s unique anymore but it certainly was. Our marketing teams and our technology teams have always worked hand in hand—even before the CTO / CMO revolution happened 5, 10 years ago. We have naturally conflicting interests, but we’re also natural partners. They’re our biggest customer; they’re trying to come up with the craziest ideas and unique things to differentiate us in the market and it’s always been up to IT to accept that challenge and figure out how to bring those big ideas to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Is digital innovation a consistent conversation at the C-level?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt;: Yes. We live it. The CEO lives it. I live it. One of our core company values is ‘only do cool stuff’, which is one that feels particularly applicable in IT. We’re constantly thinking of ways to innovate and stay cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of course, it’s getting more challenging. Most companies today—including many of our competitors and other players in the space—understand the importance of digital innovation and are investing in it. But innovation is at our core. Top to bottom. People come to Moosejaw for it. It’s a part of the fabric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’ve worked at companies where the culture is a roadblock to innovation. Some cultures can’t be saved. But if you’re in a company where people are open to something new, to a shift, you can be a change-agent. You just have to prove it. You have to walk the walk. For any change you want to create, you just have to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re in a company where people are open to something new, to a shift, you can be a change-agent. You just have to prove it. You have to walk the walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I still have to do that constantly at Moosejaw—and that’s how it should be. But I’ve had enough victories because I work to prove an idea and then I often get to see it implemented company-wide. And you just build on those successes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: So many organizations struggle to create that agility you mentioned. How do you foster and maintain a quick-moving, agile team?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt;: Our people are critical to helping us stay agile and efficient. So the obvious challenge is keeping an all-star team engaged and in place. Getting folks to buy into what we’re doing is priority number one for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Great culture comes from the top, but technology is also a different beast. We’re nerds. We like to write code, we like to dig into the nuts and bolts of things—and sometimes business priorities don’t make a ton of sense to us. When the team is excited and motivated by the work, that’s when projects are successful. And we’ve done a pretty good job of fostering that excitement over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team likes to see projects through to completion, see their work on the website, and see their efforts move the needle. That’s the fun part. That’s the payoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s a mix of showing business impact and creating space for innovation. The team likes to see projects through to completion, see their work on the website, and see their efforts move the needle. That’s the fun part. That’s the payoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What are the most important components of an effective digital strategy?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt;: &amp;quot;Digital strategy&amp;quot; is kind of a buzzword. Really, it just comes down to a few questions: Do you have what customers want, do you make it easy to find, do you make it easy to purchase, and then do you follow through? Is your customer service top-notch? (I believe ours is.) That’s how you win loyal customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How many times have you gone to a site and you just didn’t have a good experience? It doesn’t even take a horrible experience, it just takes a couple of questionable interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s my job to make sure that our great outdoor products are easy to find. That the customer’s experience is error-free. That people are able to add things to their cart and check out seamlessly with whatever payment method they want to use. Then it’s on our operations department to make sure they get their stuff as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You’ve got to nail that. If you can nail that, then you can build on that trust with marketing and branding and whimsical flavor and really solidify those customer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: For many companies, ‘digital’ is off to the side. How does Moosejaw view digital?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt;: Ecommerce is our primary sales avenue. We love our stores and continue to invest in our stores—there will always be folks who like to come in and have that in-person experience. But 80 to 90 percent of our business is done online. Our company founders were passionate about technology. People migrate towards what they love and our founders loved technology, they liked to be on the cutting edge, first-to-market, early adopters and that culture is what Moosejaw was built on, and it continues now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Are there specific digital objectives that are top-of-mind for you right now?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt;: We want to get back to innovating. The last few years, we’ve been entrenched in a necessary platform migration, and now the focus is on how to best leverage it. We’re on this latest, greatest engine but now we’re thinking about how to increase our top speed, how to navigate the racetrack. In 2021 and beyond, we want to get back to innovating, being cutting edge, and we have a few very cool projects that are going to be fun to work on in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What does innovation look like at Moosejaw? Is there a process?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt;: You know, there isn’t a process per se. I think you have to be inspired. From our CEO to our marketing leads, to our warehouse and customer service folks, there’s a hunger for innovation. You’re reminded of it everyday. Innovation and ways to innovate is always a top-level objective. No idea is too outrageous. We welcome them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a culture here that encourages people to ask, to suggest. We inspire each other to come up with different ideas and concepts—and we implement some of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, our CEO hosts a company-wide weekly meeting. He does a Q&amp;amp;A and no question is too silly or absurd. We do get some silly questions, of course, but we also get a lot of serious questions. There’s a culture here that encourages people to ask, to suggest. We inspire each other to come up with different ideas and concepts—&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; we implement some of them. And that’s the payoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Is it fairly common then for ideas that are bubbling up to actually be implemented?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt;: It’s common. It happens frequently. If somebody has an idea that feels worthwhile, no matter their department, it goes into our standard vetting process. Usually it would fall to IT to create a LOE (Level of Effort) to understand the level of effort to implement the idea. And if it makes sense, we’ll try it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our CEO is willing to gamble, which is a gift. He’ll let people take calculated risks. Sometimes they pay off, sometimes they don’t. And that’s ok. We’ve had some projects fail but we’ve had a number be really successful. Until they all start to fail, we’ll keep doing it this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We value learning. We do post-mortems on projects whether they fail or succeed—there’s so much to be learned in either case. If a project was successful, the question is often: &lt;i&gt;How can we replicate this success in other areas, compound it in other ways?&lt;/i&gt; When a project fails, we try to look at it objectively and a few questions like: &lt;i&gt;Did we just do it wrong? Is this something we can try again in a different way? Does this concept just not work for us? Is it misaligned with our brand, our culture?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Failures and successes are equally important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the final post in our series, we’ll hear the &lt;b&gt;disruptor’s perspective&lt;/b&gt;. We spoke to Bjorn Borstelmann, affectionately known as “Cap’n Bjorn”, CEO of Pirate Ship, a company that makes shipping packages fun and cheap for small businesses. Cap’n Bjorn shares his thoughts on “digital as the future” as the leader of a digital-first company.

Then, the worst happens–the register crashes and needs time to reboot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Do you abandon your cart and walk out? Most likely, no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why not? Because you’re &lt;i&gt;invested. &lt;/i&gt;You’ve come too far and waited too long to leave empty-handed and start over elsewhere, so you keep waiting to make your purchase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now imagine you encounter a similar checkout error when shopping online, where getting to that point has required nothing more than a few keystrokes and clicks. The investment that keeps you in the physical checkout line doesn’t exist here, and abandoning your cart is as easy as closing the browser. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-consumer-survey?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 77% of consumers will leave a site after encountering a single error. Over half of shoppers surveyed say the most frustrating error to encounter in online transactions is a glitch on the page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are five areas to focus on to improve your online store’s checkout flow, which can directly reduce cart abandonment rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Be transparent about shipping costs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Revealing shipping costs at the very end of the checkout process is a guaranteed way to drive up your cart abandonment rates. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;research conducted by Baymard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 50% of shoppers who abandon carts do so because shipping/extra costs were too high, and an additional 18% abandoned carts because they weren’t able to calculate the total order cost up front. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hitting shoppers with unexpected shipping costs during checkout can go even further than creating high cart abandonment rates: it can erode trust. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/resources/articles/customer-engagement/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;2020 Salesforce report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 9 in 10 customers are more loyal to companies they trust, and 2 out of 3 customers have stopped buying from companies that did something they considered distrustful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A simple way to combat knee-jerk abandonments is to indicate the cost as the shopper adds items to their cart, or to add a “Calculate Shipping” function where a shopper can enter their zip code and see an estimated cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These simple fixes can ultimately help you to earn your customers’ trust and loyalty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Add a progress indicator bar &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
For online shoppers, checkout flows with multiple pages or steps can feel unnecessarily long and tedious–especially when they can’t tell how many more steps there are to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is where adding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://material.io/components/progress-indicators&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;simple progress indicator bar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; becomes a practical tool. It helps your customers orient themselves in the checkout flow and see exactly how much further they have to go before clicking “Purchase.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Baymard’s research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 21% of cart abandonments were due to a checkout process that was “too long/complicated.” While progress bars don’t actually shorten the steps to checkout, they do appeal to the idea of “endowed progress”–that we are more likely to complete a task if we are alerted of the progress (real or artificial) towards this task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Reduce “click energy”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-consumer-survey?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consumer survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 83% of shoppers say that a “good” digital experience is defined by the ability to “quickly accomplish what I came to do.” Which, in ecommerce, is to find an item and purchase it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customers have a finite amount of “click energy,” which dwindles as they move through your website until they ultimately lose the will to continue. It’s up to you to create a shopping experience that’s straightforward enough that your customer still has click energy left when they arrive at the checkout page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One extreme example of conserving customers’ click energy is Amazon’s familiar 1-click purchasing, which literally allows shoppers to make purchases with a single mouse click. (Or, in 2021, a single trackpad tap.) And it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pymnts.com/amazon-payments/2017/1-click-checkout-amazon-mobile-app-shopping-cart/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;worked out well&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for them, with 70% of all orders on 1-click. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your checkout flow requires more click energy than a shopper has left in the tank, the likelihood of abandonment skyrockets. One straightforward way to reduce click energy is in the “Review Order” step of the checkout process. In most cases, shoppers aren’t able to actually change any information–whether it’s a typo in the address or the wrong quantity of an item–from that page. Rather, they’re forced to return to an earlier step/page in the checkout flow to make the change, often leading to frustration, impatience, and additional input errors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;For more on conserving click energy, download our ecommerce guide. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://experience.fullstory.com/retail/creating-delight-guide&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://experience.fullstory.com/retail/creating-delight-guide&quot;&gt;→&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Allow guest checkout&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Being asked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;create an account&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to complete a purchase is the &lt;b&gt;second most common cause&lt;/b&gt; of cart abandonments, according to Baymard’s research. This data makes it clear that being required to create an account is a deal breaker for many users. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://baymard.com/blog/current-state-of-checkout-ux&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;in 2020&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 18% of websites still required users to create an account in order to transact (down from 24% in 2012). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the majority of customers prefer using guest checkout to making an account, nearly three-fourths of ecommerce sites don’t make guest checkout the most prominent option. 

For both desktop and mobile, offering guest checkout as an easy-to-find option can significantly reduce cart abandonments and make the path to purchase smoother for your customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Conduct informed experiments with session replay insights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Running A/B tests is a great way to experiment with changes to your digital experience and monitor what resonates with your audience. Then, you can iterate on your future DX improvements based on what you learn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
One of the most challenging parts of this process is simply deciding what you want to test–which is where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=guide&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can save the day. Rather than guessing what to test, watch a few sessions of users navigating through your checkout process and get a feel for elements that might be causing friction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Tests can be as simple as copy variations or changing the color of CTA buttons, or as complex as reorganizing a page to test what appears above the fold. With experimentation, the possibilities are endless–and watching user sessions is a great way to generate ideas for tests to run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://experience.fullstory.com/retail/creating-delight-guide?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=guide&quot;&gt;Download our ecommerce guide, Creating Delight, for more insights and real-world examples of ecommerce site optimization.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Actionable approaches for building and analyzing ecommerce conversion funnels]]></title><description><![CDATA[How to build useful, scalable conversion funnels to inform ecommerce experience improvements. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/actionable-approaches-for-building-and-analyzing-ecommerce-conversion</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/actionable-approaches-for-building-and-analyzing-ecommerce-conversion</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Madison Eubanks]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your ecommerce conversion funnel—that is, the path that visitors take to make a purchase—is perhaps the most important workflow on your site. &lt;a href=&quot;https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Baymard Institute found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the average large-sized ecommerce site can increase overall conversion rate by over 35% by making critical improvements to the checkout flow.

Your job is to keep your digital ecommerce experience smooth, easy-to-navigate, and issue-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Building and analyzing conversion funnels can help you identify where users are hitting the biggest hiccups that are causing them to drop out of key workflows, like a dead button inside the checkout flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, funnel analysis can help you understand if page performance is an issue, or if problems impact certain segments of customers more than others (like those shopping on Chrome versus Safari). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Identifying issues like these through funnel analysis enables you to understand which issues are having the greatest effect on customer experience, and then prioritize where your engineering team should focus their attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;When conversion funnels are useful for improving your ecommerce experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When should you turn to funnel analytics to uncover an opportunity in your ecommerce digital experience? Here are a few examples: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identifying “unknown unknowns”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Often, when looking for flaws in your ecommerce experience, it can be difficult to know where to begin. Building a broad funnel for the most vital workflows on your site—the steps in your checkout flow, in particular—gives you a starting point from which to find more granular improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Testing a hypothesis &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Perhaps you’ve been poking around in your digital experience analytics and you’ve come up with an idea for a way to improve a page on your site. For example, you’ve hypothesized that adding a checkbox where users can say “shipping address is the same as billing address” will get 5% more shoppers to the next stage of checkout. You can test this change on a segment of users, and then compare how they flow through the funnel versus those who don’t see the checkbox. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measuring negative impact &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversion funnels are most useful for helping you understand which elements of your site are having the most negative impact on the customer experience, rather than elements that might be having a positive effect. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.ctfassets.net/dkgr2j75jrom/3pAbcjFwojjHilGn5iso7W/70b27dbe76d1052305b24a612b540ebc/fs-moosejaw-ux-cx-dx-customer-1-pager-lowres.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory customer Moosejaw&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; conducted an audit of their checkout funnel and found that a seemingly minor error—how address verification messages were displayed—was having an outsized negative impact on conversions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;For more tips on creating a delightful ecommerce shopping experience, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/how-to-optimize-your-ecommerce-sales-funnel?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=guide&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;download the Guide to Ecommerce Optimizatio&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/how-to-optimize-your-ecommerce-sales-funnel?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=guide&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;n. →&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best practices for building effective conversion funnels &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your conversion funnels are a powerful tool for improving your ecommerce experience, and there are a few simple steps you can take to ensure they’re highly effective. Here are five best practices for getting the most out of your conversion funnels: 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversion funnels need at least two events, but including &lt;b&gt;four to six events in your funnel&lt;/b&gt; will ensure that it provides a clear, thorough look at how users move through the series of steps. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure the &lt;b&gt;first step in your funnel isn’t too broad&lt;/b&gt;. Users can fall out of a funnel at any time–even after the first step–so you want it to be narrow enough to find meaningful user data. For example, “Visited my homepage URL,” might be too broad to be a useful first step in your funnel, but “Visited the URL containing /summer-styles” is a happy medium.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice an exceptionally large drop-off between two steps in your funnel (like between “Clicked ‘Add to cart’” and “Viewed cart”), consider &lt;b&gt;breaking your funnel into two separate funnels to get a more granular view&lt;/b&gt; of what might be causing a dramatic drop-off rate. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose a &lt;b&gt;date range &lt;/b&gt;for your funnel that’s&lt;b&gt; appropriate to what you want to measure&lt;/b&gt;. For example, if you want to see the impact resulting from a change you implemented recently, set the date range to “This past week.” 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;b&gt;narrowing your funnel analysis to a single attribute&lt;/b&gt; to understand how different cohorts of users might be experiencing your site. For example, look at mobile shoppers versus desktop shoppers, or those browsing on Chrome versus those browsing on Safari, to see if there are any notable trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;For more tips on building effective funnels, check out this blog post on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/funnel-analysis-for-digital-experience?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;using funnels to understand user behavior. →&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How FullStory takes conversion funnels to the next level with Conversions and Revenue Opportunities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many analytics solutions offer the ability to build and analyze conversion funnels, but FullStory enables ecommerce pros to go beyond traditional funnel analysis with two powerful funnel enhancements: Conversions and Revenue Opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Built by our team of data science experts, FullStory &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/conversions-by-fullstory?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conversions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; uses machine learning to analyze different cohorts of users as they pass through your key funnels. By showing exactly when, where, and why users are dropping out of those funnels, Conversions enables digital ecommerce teams to prioritize issues based on business impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Plus, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/user-experience-issues-by-revenue?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Revenue Opportunities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; allows users to define and select Revenue Events that represent specific business transactions, and correlate the projected annualized revenue lost to specific issues in your funnel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Knowing how much revenue is associated with a particular issue enables ecommerce teams to intelligently and confidently prioritize issues in order of business impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To learn more about making high-impact user experience improvements with FullStory, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fullstory.com/demo?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=demo&quot;&gt;talk to one of our experts.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[5 ecommerce strategy tips for an increasingly online world]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ecommerce is the new way people buy just about everything—and it’s not going away.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tip #1: Keep a pulse on customer intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Building shopping experiences should align with what shoppers need and want at any given moment. The goal is to stay agile. This means staying as close to customers as possible, as well as observing how they interact with your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/ecommerce-trends-2021/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ecommerce experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support tickets, chats, phone calls, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/nps-digital-customer-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;net promoter score (NPS) surveys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—these are direct methods for understanding the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/trends-digital-customer-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital customer experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But these methods also put all of the onus on your shopper to take the time to share what they’re experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;That’s why it’s essential to have a Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) platform in place to help you keep a pulse on digital shopping behavior.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;DXI platforms such as FullStory allow product teams to understand a customer’s digital journey through the eyes of shoppers. With billions of digital experience data points—how each visitor navigates and interacts with every element of your site—product teams can see behaviors that correlate to negative, frustrating online experiences. These events are searchable to developers, designers, customer support, and other teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

This is where an integrated tech stack is very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider all of the technologies you use to power your ecommerce experience, including software to connect with your shoppers, customers, and users via digital channels such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer support (chatbots, ticketing systems)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineering (project management, debugging)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Product management (analytics, a/b testing)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;UX design (user research, voice of customer)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital marketing (a/b testing, analytics, automation)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal collaboration and communication (messaging, project management)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/synergies-in-the-stack/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;connected your tech stack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the easier it is to facilitate cross-team alignment and reduce time wasted syncing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your tools don’t integrate, reach out to vendors to express interest in a specific integration. Chances are it’s already on their product roadmap or it can be requested to add.

Whether this is your first test or you’ve conducted many, stop and evaluate your approach to testing amid &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we understand the shifts in shopper behavior to this point?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do we have a way to monitor future shifts in shopper behavior?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are our experimentation efforts focused on the right areas for this moment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are our teams able to share insights efficiently and stay aligned when urgency is key?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are we able to quickly ship new experiences or are internal processes sluggish?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To begin an experimental strategy campaign, we must first observe shopper behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Understanding the shift in shopper behavior&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The term “digital transformation” has gone from an aspirational idea for many companies to a necessary reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
The past few years have rapidly &lt;a href=&quot;https://securecdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Great-Reopening-Tracking-Digitals-Quantum-Leap.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;accelerated ecommerce adoption&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, triggering an incredible amount of growth. Many consumers have shifted to shopping online, and if they continue to do so at the same level, it could translate into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;$54 trillion in e-commerce sales&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that would otherwise have been made in brick-and-mortar shops. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-strategic-technology-trends-for-2021&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gartner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by 2024, 80% of IT organizations will undergo radical restructuring and changes to their missions as they embrace product-centric operating models. How can you stay ahead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
It’s important to note that these behaviors are driven by external circumstances, shoppers’ emotional states, and contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Understanding the behavioral science behind why shoppers do what they do will help to be proactive when it comes to anticipating changes in behavior; emotion is a key determinant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Because our logical brains have taken a back seat, we need extra guidance in simple situations. We need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/deliver-value-now-boost-customer-loyalty/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;more reassurance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that our choices will benefit us, and we need more guarantees that if we do make a choice, we can unmake it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Businesses need to have a deep understanding of what motivates shoppers to design and launch the most impactful experiments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Let’s dig into the 5 tips for experimental strategies in the digital unknown. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tips to adjust experimentation strategies for the unknown &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are five actions you can take right now to adjust your experimentation strategy in response to any crisis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Update your customer research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As things change in the world, stay on top of customer intel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Refresh your current customer research and at regularly scheduled intervals in the future. This requires using both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;quantitative and qualitative methods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to prioritize customers’ most pressing needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Track current product demand&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Test ways to ensure what customers currently want is readily available—and identify and validate emerging product opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalance.com/us-economic-outlook-3305669&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;market growth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this is a factor of growth for the whole market which is sourced from market research. With the whole of market growth statistics, compare those to your own business growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Analyze risk and reward&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dial up or down experimentation program &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-risk-tolerance-2466649&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;risk tolerance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; depending on how the market growth is impacting your sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Evaluation should include the state of the business, the state of the market, and the tools needed to move forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Invest where it makes sense&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Make calculated investments where it fits. This includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lever.co/blog/blog-best-practices-in-recruiting-win-talent/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;hiring the best talent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, acquiring new traffic, or investing in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to power your digitization. This could also mean subtracting current investments that are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Enlist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/analyze-digital-experience-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital experience data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to cut time to resolution and boost customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This allows you to see firsthand which investments are making an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Reevaluate your tech stack&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Benchmark your digital tech maturity, audit your existing toolset, evaluate alternatives and then consider negotiating better rates or changing to a provider that allows you to modernize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fueling future growth with DXI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a leading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solution, FullStory understands the need to be agile. We’ve been helping product, engineering, and UX teams gather a deeper view of how people interact with sites or apps––it&amp;#x27;s searchable, extensible, and dynamically enriching to any tech-stack, not to mention aligning with teams to accelerate innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This innovation will allow customer experience and digital intelligence to fuel business objectives in the unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By getting full visibility into how customers interact with businesses online, you can glean actionable insights designed to drive business results—even at the most unpredictable of times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[FullStory's first virtual DERP (Drop Everything for Recreational Play)]]></title><description><![CDATA[When it comes to fostering togetherness in a remote world, we're getting creative.

They are customer experience enthusiasts. They write code for their open source project on the weekends. They are, and aspire to be, masters of their crafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The downside? It’s easy to get pulled down the work rabbit hole. In our earliest days, we realized that sometimes folks needed a gentle nudge to close their laptops, step away from their desks and connect with each other in silly and imaginative ways. Enter: DERPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;DERP stands for Drop Everything for Recreational Play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Meetings? &lt;i&gt;Cancelled.&lt;/i&gt; Staring at a report? &lt;i&gt;Cancelled.&lt;/i&gt; When we say drop everything, we mean &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;. In the old, in-person days, DERPs included company-wide Rube Goldberg challenges, games of Balderdash, and spirited trivia tournaments. The possibilities for silliness were endless when almost everyone was together in the same building, but then 2020 hit. Fostering connections and holding the space to be silly is even more important now, but we wondered: Could DERPs work virtually?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Turns out, they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For our most recent DERP, we organized a virtual scavenger hunt to tap into our FullStorians’ competitive spirits. Here’s how it worked:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each Family (how we refer to our internal departments) sent forth 5 volunteer representatives to compete against each other in the scavenger hunt. In lieu of a cheering audience, we utilized &lt;a href=&quot;https://bionic.fullstory.com/bwamp/&quot;&gt;BWAMP&lt;/a&gt; to encourage audience participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the virtual scavenger hunt, contestants were asked to find standard household items like a piece of fruit, a (clean!) sock, a shampoo bottle, a favorite snack, something that makes noise, or a book. During their turn, contestants had 30 seconds to scramble around their house and find the requested item, come back to the screen, and shout their Family name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The virtual DERP was a huge success, and proved to be fun for more than just FullStorians. Kids, pets, and at least one Roomba joined in the fun–joys that we wouldn’t have experienced at an in-office DERP. A clown horn, a bottle of lice shampoo, and a whole bag of apples were just a few of the more memorable items that made appearances. We laughed, we learned about our coworkers’ unexpected hobbies, and we even grew a bit concerned when one sales engineer brought an entire coffee pot when asked to retrieve a mug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But… who won?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Sales Family (💰) earned the bragging rights this time around. (Word on the street is the Product Family is coming for them next DERP.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But really, we all won by spending an hour together just having fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that FullStory has &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-goes-remote/&quot;&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; to going forward as a fully distributed company, FullStorians can expect to continue having lots more virtual fun through DERPs. It’s one of the many ways we’ll stay connected to each other and energize ourselves on our mission to make the web a more perfect place for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interested in joining the FullStory team?

That’s because we deeply value FullStorians’ career growth. To promote that growth, we’ve launched internal initiatives like Sales Academy—a program designed to invest in our next generation of Account Executives and Sales Development Representatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We caught up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-scannella-219aa655/&quot;&gt;Jeff Scannella&lt;/a&gt;, the brains behind Sales Academy at FullStory, to tell us more about the program and how sellers can anticipate to grow their career at FullStory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Give us a quick bio, and maybe toss in a fun fact for good measure. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jeff: &lt;/b&gt;I have spent the past eight years in the digital marketing and software space, holding several leadership roles in both sales management and enablement. My passion is helping those around me achieve their greatest ambitions in their career and driving a fantastic team environment. Under my tutelage, 15 team members have received President&amp;#x27;s or Winner&amp;#x27;s Circle Status. I bring a unique blend of dynamic energy, enthusiasm and relentless pursuit of excellence to the team!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;My fun fact is that I played professional soccer in Europe prior to getting my professional career started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Okay, first things first: What&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; is &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sales Academy? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jeff:&lt;/b&gt; FullStory Sales Academy, our new hire program, has been carefully crafted to enable new sales team members to learn, be curious, and practice key concepts to equip them with the tools needed to be successful. Over the course of our three week program, new team members will learn about the Digital Experience Intelligence industry, processes, tools, and sales skills that will establish core fundamentals before getting into the field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Week 2 of Sales Academy was really great. At the beginning of the week, it was very daunting to think that by week&amp;#x27;s end I&amp;#x27;d be delivering my first demo. But I&amp;#x27;m glad that you challenged me to do that because I felt way more confident after actually accomplishing the recording. Thank you for the push! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;- FullStory Account Executive&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: So who does it help? Is it only for Account Executives, or are Sales Development Representatives invited to the party as well?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jeff: &lt;/b&gt;We have created the program to establish core fundamentals necessary for &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;sales specific role. This allows for collaboration in breakout settings and an enormous amount of peer to peer learning. When combined with role specific shadowing and mentoring, this allows for our team members to get acclimated effectively in order to have an impact in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What happens afterward… Is there ongoing education after the Sales Academy?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jeff:&lt;/b&gt; YES! We have numerous opportunities for ongoing learning for our new and tenured hires. We have team wide Continued Education sessions that are open to the entirety of the Sales organization. These take place twice a month and cover topics that will aid the growth of a variety of skill sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition, we have built an ongoing Sales Skill coaching program, which we call &lt;i&gt;Ignite&lt;/i&gt;, to continue New Hire learning for another eight weeks following the initial three week Academy program. This will become available to ALL new hires in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This was by far the best work training I have ever experienced. Jeff was so hands-on, and knowing that he will continue to be available to train me in areas of weakness gives me a lot of confidence moving forward.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;- FullStory Sales Development Representative&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: After NewStorians wrap up Sales Academy, how do you want them to feel?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jeff: &lt;/b&gt;After completing Sales Academy, I hope folks feel confident and excited to dive into selling FullStory. When approaching customers, they will be comfortable demonstrating the value we can provide, and they will understand that trust-building and problem-solving are imperative to building credibility. I also hope they feel part of a true team despite being onboarded remotely—winning together and cheering each other on is a huge part of our culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Curious how you can join the coolest sales team in SaaS?

But as our business matured, our product became more complex, and we began to acquire larger and larger customers, it became apparent that we needed to address availability in a holistic way if we wanted to achieve our desired scale. That’s why in early 2020, shortly after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/technical-program-management-why-we-started-a-tpm-team/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;creating our Technical Program Management team&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to stand up a dedicated Availability program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this post, we’ll describe how we started and operationalized an Availability program from scratch using Site Reliability Engineering principles and the Service Level Objectives framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Desired Business Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As with all of our TPM programs, the first step in standing up the Availability program was defining our Desired Business Outcomes (DBOs). Written by the TPM team and agreed upon by Engineering leadership, DBOs serve as the “north star” for our programs. They help guide prioritization of individual projects within the program, and we use them as a litmus test to ensure that everything we’re working on can be tied back to key business goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We decided upon the following DBOs for the Availability program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers can trust that all parts of the FullStory platform will be consistently available and performant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Availability/SLOs are defined and bionically tracked across all components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Availability is used as a barometer of our engineering quality and influences strategic planning/prioritization decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can tell the &amp;quot;high availability&amp;quot; story publicly with the numbers to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With our Desired Business Outcomes in place, we could move on to the specific projects and tasks necessary to achieve those outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Choosing a framework&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We knew that we needed some sort of framework that would provide us with a common language for discussing and tracking availability. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we quickly decided to standardize on what is arguably the gold standard in the field of Site Reliability Engineering: &lt;a href=&quot;https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google&amp;#x27;s SRE book&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google&amp;#x27;s framework includes three key, interrelated concepts: Service Level Indicators, Service Level Objectives, and Service Level Agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;b&gt;Service Level Indicator&lt;/b&gt; (SLI) is a metric that can be used to tell us something about our availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;b&gt;Service Level Objective&lt;/b&gt; (SLO) is a target that we set for a particular SLI or set of SLIs. SLOs also dictate your &lt;b&gt;Error Budget&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a &lt;b&gt;Service Level Agreement&lt;/b&gt; (SLA) is a contractual agreement that dictates what happens if we fail to meet certain SLOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The SRE book delves into each of these concepts in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For the initial stages of the Availability program we decided to focus on defining our most important Service Level Indicators, as well as a set of internal Service Level Objectives for which we would hold ourselves accountable. But before coming up with SLIs and SLOs, we needed to identify which pieces of the FullStory platform we wanted to measure. To achieve this, we divided FullStory into “components.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Defining our availability “components”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A component represents a surface area of the FullStory platform &lt;i&gt;from the perspective of a customer&lt;/i&gt;. This is an important distinction: we could’ve chosen to simply define SLIs and SLOs for every backend service within FullStory’s architecture. But instead, framing our components from the customer’s perspective helps to ensure we’re optimizing for metrics that are closer to the actual customer experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, the customer doesn&amp;#x27;t necessarily care that microservice XYZ experienced an increase in request latency. Microservice XYZ is an implementation detail of our system. However, the customer &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; care if FullStory&amp;#x27;s search functionality is sluggish or unusable, since that is directly tied to the value they’re receiving from the FullStory application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ultimately, we decided on the following components:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web Recording: Our ability to record data from customers’ websites&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile Recording: Our ability to record data from customers’ mobile apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;API: Our suite of public-facing REST APIs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;App: The FullStory web application (app.fullstory.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing: The data processing pipeline that takes raw recorded data and makes it available for analysis within FullStory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We also identified an individual owner for each component (usually the manager or Tech Lead of the most relevant team).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Choosing SLIs and SLOs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We then turned our attention to defining an initial set of SLIs and SLOs for each component. We held workshops with each component owner to identify the areas of each component that were 1) most directly tied to customer experience and 2) easily measurable. We considered all of the various flavors of SLI (availability, latency, freshness, durability, etc) and discussed which ones were most applicable to the given component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, for the Web Recording component, we decided upon two Service Level Indicators:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;i&gt;availability&lt;/i&gt; SLI measuring the percentage of successful requests to our `recorder` service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;latency&lt;/i&gt; SLI measuring the percentage of requests completing within one second&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Choosing an appropriate Service Level Objective for each Service Level Indicator can be an art form unto itself. The SLO should ideally match the customer’s expectations of how the service should perform. If an SLO is too aggressive, it becomes unrealistic to achieve. On the other hand, if an SLO is too lax, you may be able to meet the SLO while still providing a poor customer experience, which is obviously undesirable. Since these were internal targets, we were able to set our initial SLOs with the knowledge that we could continue to iterate on them if they turned out to be too high or too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Operationalizing the Availability program&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At this point, we were finally ready to transition from theoretical discussions to practical implementation of the Availability program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fortunately, most of the underlying data for our SLIs was already being captured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://prometheus.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prometheus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the time-series database that we use for monitoring. For the small number of SLIs that we weren’t already capturing, we worked with the relevant Engineering teams to implement Prometheus metrics for them. Then, the TPM team wrote PromQL queries to express each of our Service Level Indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We use &lt;a href=&quot;https://grafana.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Grafana&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as our visualization layer on top of Prometheus. We created a Grafana dashboard for each availability component, allowing us to easily view our SLIs/SLOs in both a time-series and aggregate number format across any desired date range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;A portion of our Grafana dashboard for the Web Recording component&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These dashboards were the key to enabling us to communicate about SLIs and SLOs to the broader Engineering organization. The main venues for this communication are the monthly “SLO Review” meetings that we established with component owners and other relevant stakeholders. These meetings are held at the beginning of each calendar month, and the agenda includes reviewing our SLO compliance for the previous calendar month, identifying areas for improvement, and checking in on open action items. We also set up weekly asynchronous check-ins to ensure that we are on track to meet our SLOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Avoiding vanity metrics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another aspect of operationalizing this program was coming up with a mechanism to ensure that our SLIs are always measuring the right things. In other words, we wanted to guard against our SLIs becoming “vanity metrics” and make sure that they are always representative of the actual customer experience. To this end, we began mapping customer support tickets back to our SLIs. Each week, the TPM team reviews all of the support tickets we received in which a customer was inquiring about a performance or reliability issue. We determine if the issue being reported in each ticket is already measured by an existing SLI, or if there is the potential for us to modify or expand our SLIs to more comprehensively measure the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The existence of the Availability program has enabled us to speak more confidently (both internally and externally) about the reliability of our platform, proactively identify issues that impact our SLOs, and cultivate an SRE mindset across the entire Engineering organization. We&amp;#x27;ve also begun using SLO compliance to inform our risk tolerance and help us prioritize between new feature development and availability-related work. We&amp;#x27;ll continue to invest heavily in the program going forward, improving the comprehensiveness of our SLIs, ingraining availability into our Engineering culture, and delivering a best-in-class experience to customers of the FullStory platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What you need to know about data quality and DXI]]></title><description><![CDATA[Poor-quality data lacks the actionability teams need to make iterative improvements.

Your data shouldn’t cost you money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Poor data quality has been said to cost organizations up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ciodive.com/news/poor-software-quality-report-2020/593015/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;$2 trillion per year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So what would non-quality data cost you?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To answer that question, let’s analyze the difference between good and poor data, the dimensions to prioritize, and how to improve your data with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The low down on data quality &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before we talk about data as a whole, it’s important to clarify its importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Essentially, data is of high quality if the data correctly represents what it describes. It’s an essential part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/data-governance&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;data governance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that ensures your data is fit for its intended purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Companies know they have high-quality data when they’re able to put it to use—communicating effectively with their customers, finding new ways to serve them, and more. It refers to the overall utility of a dataset and its ability to easily process and analyze it for other uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A rule of thumb: quality data is actionable data.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the flip side, low (or poor) quality data hides valuable opportunities and cab leave a company struggling to identify shortcomings. As it is innately less trustworthy, it has to be verified repeatedly for accuracy—a timely process for busy teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In essence, reliance on data you’re not sure about to make business decisions yields an inadequate standpoint for teams to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The core dimensions of data quality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Depending on what industry you’re in, prioritizing your core dimensions of data quality is important to not only support use cases but to obtain high-quality data. Here are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lotame.com/why-is-data-quality-important/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;five core dimensions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of data quality to consider prioritizing today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accuracy&lt;/b&gt;: The certainty of data that reflects the information or event it’s intended to represent. This data is measured by how the values agree with the known information source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Validity&lt;/b&gt;: The data must comply with business rules and fall within the data parameters when those rules are applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Completeness&lt;/b&gt;: The data meets all required values and records available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Timeliness&lt;/b&gt;: Data is updated in real-time, to ensure that it meets user requirements for accessibility, accuracy, and availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consistency&lt;/b&gt;: Data values are the same across all instances of an application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
One way to help prioritize your data is to use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool such as FullStory. With a DXI platform, you can access &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/analyze-digital-experience-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;complete customer experience data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and definitively learn how users interact with your site or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Improve and enhance data quality with DXI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Instead of anecdotal, low-quality data gathered from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/nps-digital-customer-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;NPS surveys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, DXI allows product, UX, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/engineers-guide-dxi/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;engineering teams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to zoom in on how users really interact with your website or app via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real, logged interactions are the ultimate in quality data.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And, when you improve your data quality with DXI, good things happen:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Increased revenue with better conversions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With high-quality data, identify revenue-impacting issues, and understand how customers are affected by your product.

We launched an experiment to redirect half of our customers to an optional customer survey right after signing up (and before activating their account). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The rationale for the placement was that we wanted the survey to show up early enough to be close to the point of conversion (“signing up,” in our case) but not disrupt the onboarding experience after account activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In terms of our tech stack, we used &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624054-Optimizely-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Optimizely&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an experimentation platform that lets marketing and product teams test, learn and deploy digital experiences. Once &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;integrated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it gives you powerful insights into how users interact with your tests as well as provides ideas on what new tests to run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Then, we used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jotform.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jotform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a free online form builder, to create 12 response choices (a user can select as many as they like) and a field for respondents to provide additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s what the user flow looked like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sign up&lt;/b&gt;: The user enters their email and hits the “go” button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Survey page&lt;/b&gt;: The user is prompted by a call-to-action to check their email for an activation link, but also has the opportunity to fill out the survey if they would like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Submission confirmation page&lt;/b&gt;: If the user decides to fill out and submit the survey, we thank them for taking the time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Results that surprise and delight &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The results far exceeded our expectations, with over 3 out of 4 signups who received the survey submitting a response. Pretty impressive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At first, we thought the result was too good to be true for an optional poll. However, we created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828993-Segment&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;segment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for these users, watched several session replays, and realized they interacted with the form as we&amp;#x27;d hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The survey helped us understand several things about our customer base:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our intuitions about word-of-mouth were correct. The largest percentage of respondents indicated that they learned about FullStory through a colleague or friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/nps-digital-customer-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Net Promoter Score (NPS) survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the open-response helped us discover several digital channels we hadn’t attributed leads to, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2Z14M1EA6c&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ran Segall’s YouTube channel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Neil Patel’s Marketing School Podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also discovered other interesting lead sources including previous employers, industry events, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/engineers-guide-dxi/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;software engineers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exploring a website’s JavaScript console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite revealing useful insights, the real question is—do surveys detract from users’ experience or prevent sign-ups? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here, we turned to FullStory’s DXI platform to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/analyze-digital-experience-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;analyze digital experience data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Our team searched for sessions in which the survey was answered, and observed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/why-you-cant-do-a-user-interview-without-skin-in-the-game/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;real user behavior&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Although users generally navigated our survey seamlessly, we found some potential friction points that could potentially sidetrack some users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Luckily, the conversion rate differential between our test (those who saw the survey) and control groups (those who did not see the survey) was not statistically significant, leading us to conclude that the survey did not have a meaningful impact on our conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep in mind, a DXI solution lets you track and search for almost all UX metrics via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;OmniSearch&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/actionable-approaches-for-building-and-analyzing-ecommerce-conversion/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conversion funnels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We further checked to see if users exposed to the survey had a lower rate of recording and playing sessions, and again to our relief, they did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Useful insights via Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ideally, we wanted to incorporate the survey results into our broader business metrics in order to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimize marketing resources to the right channels where people are most receptive &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate new ideas and test new channels as our company scales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the survey data to calibrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;quantitative models&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
At FullStory, we are heavy users of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-data-export/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data Export&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We use it to pipe indexed user event data from our site into &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/bigquery&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google BigQuery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. From there, we query the data and match survey results with the costs and revenue earned for each channel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With BigQuery, we’ve built a handy dashboard that can tell us the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.profitwell.com/recur/all/annual-recurring-revenue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;annual recurring revenue&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchimp.com/marketing-glossary/customer-acquisition-cost/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer acquisition cost&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for our main digital acquisition channels, combined with some of the categories selected on the survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Among other useful insights, identify sponsored events that lead to big accounts—so you’ll be sure to sponsor and attend them again in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Determining which product features offer the most value to certain audience segments can be a bit of a challenge. That said, DXI helps bridge the gap. By double-clicking into the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; behind users’ decision to visit your site, teams can get useful insights for next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[8 ways to turn product ideas into a prioritized product roadmap]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn how to find your product's "North Star" and discover tried-and-true tactics for turning ideas into tangible product roadmaps.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/product-ideas-into-roadmap</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/product-ideas-into-roadmap</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Leading a product team is a lot like captaining a ship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The product team is responsible for calling the shots; steering the ship and ensuring the team is on board with a planned course. But just like a captain, the product lead has to rapidly change as the conditions around us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But as the captains of the product ship, it can’t ride the strongest current and expect to reach its intended destination safely. The team also can’t anchor and wait for calmer seas before setting sail again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How can teams effectively plot out the course of their journey without letting opinions and ideas lead them astray?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The answer: a &lt;a href=&quot;https://productmanagerhq.com/what-is-a-product-roadmap/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;product roadmap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finding the North Star: business objectives and product vision&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In times of uncertainty, sailors look to the skies for guidance. Similarly, seasoned captains of product need a North Star when feeling lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;High-level business objectives and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ganotnoa.com/product-strategy-101-its-about-depth-not-just-vision/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;strategic product vision&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; come together to form a guiding light to follow through times of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While celestial bodies, like business objectives and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cacoo.com/blog/create-inspiring-product-vision-statement/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;product vision statements&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are excellent high-level navigational aids, they rarely tell us &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite having ever-present references of where to go, captains need to determine the best course to take based on ever-changing conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Similarly, product managers are left with questions about how to find the product roadmap’s North Star:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s an effective product strategy that won’t leave the crew feeling salty?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which compelling features will get built first?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I course correct to reflect changing conditions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Usually the how is a matter of simply finding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smartinsights.com/marketing-planning/marketing-models/ogsm-model-framework/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;objective frameworks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for product decisions, listening to input from your team, and course-correcting as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are some tried and true tactics for accomplishing these things through thoughtful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/9-blocker/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;product roadmap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; prioritization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Actionable data can be used to discover trends, uncover bugs, develop better experiences, and plan product roadmaps with a Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) solution.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Request a demo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and see it in action yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Techniques for prioritizing your product roadmap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. User feedback and behavior&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customers are a great source of information to help prioritize product initiatives. Here are a few ways to look at customer requests and feedback to identify trends: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What features or improvements do customers request most often? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are the customers making those requests high-value? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are they coming from a group of customers who are likely to churn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Go beyond listening to what customers say and actually see how they interact with your product. Try FullStory’s Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) feature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that can help identify frustration points, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/#thrashed-cursor&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;thrashed cursor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to find opportunities to improve. If a particular area is a frequent source of frustration, it may be worth prioritizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/b&gt;Looking at user feedback and behavior can help better understand the value of an existing list of initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Value versus complexity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://welldoneby.com/blog/best-prioritization-techniques-you-will-need/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;value versus complexity model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for feature prioritization takes a rather popular business decision-making quadrant and helps apply it specifically to product decisions. This method is fairly common due to how easy it is to apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Starting with a list of potential features, estimate their potential business value as well as the approximate amount of complexity and effort involved to build them. Then, plot each initiative on a grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The features that land in the high value/low complexity section are “low-hanging fruits” features that are a good starting point. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the low value/high complexity features are probably not the highest priority to work on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; The value versus complexity model is a quick way to compare features based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;quantitative&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; estimates and for visually explaining product decisions to stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Weighted scoring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/weighted-scoring-model/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;weighted scoring model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is similar to a value versus complexity prioritization model. Use scores to assign different weights to different strategic benefits and compare them with costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Assign weights across a series of benefit categories that tie directly into business objectives. Then assign the same for costs like implementation and operational costs, as well as considering risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From there, assign scores to these categories for every feature on the list to prioritize. Based on the weights assigned to each benefit and cost, reach a quantitative score and rank for each initiative on the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; Weighted scoring models are useful for product teams who need to make objective decisions about feature prioritization while considering multiple factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. A bucket approach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A “bucket” approach or more formally known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jigsawacademy.com/blogs/product-management/kano-model&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kano Model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is used to understand the relationship between customer delight and product function to prioritize a balanced product roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using the Kano Model, features are categorized in the following buckets and assessed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Threshold&lt;/b&gt;: the functionalities needed to sell the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performance:&lt;/b&gt; the features that aid in increasing customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excitement:&lt;/b&gt; the optional features that increase customer delight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; The Kano model is useful for teams with various differing objectives who need a way to keep a balance between all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Buy a feature&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Buying” features can help understand how important features and functionalities are to stakeholders and customers. The process is simple but can be a fun activity involving your team in the prioritization process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Start by making a list of potential features, giving each one its own “price.” Prices are based on the estimated development costs associated with each feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hand out a “currency” and have participants purchase the features they want. Most likely some people will put all of their “money” on a single feature while others spend their feature allowances on multiple items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the end, you’ll have a list of prioritized features to improve upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; “Buying” features is a technique that’s best for a quick, interactive way to understand where a group of people see the most value across a list of features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. Opportunity scoring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.productplan.com/glossary/opportunity-scoring/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Opportunity scoring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a method used to identify opportunities to better meet customer needs. This customer-centric prioritization approach takes into consideration two factors: feature importance and existing satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ask customers to rank or score the importance of a list of features. After that, have them rank or score their level of satisfaction with the feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Based on these inputs, generate a list of opportunities: features with high importance scores and low satisfaction scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; Opportunity scoring works well when determining where to make incremental improvements to a list of pre-existing features based on customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;7. Affinity grouping&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;An affinity group is a collection of people that have a common interest or goal towards a specific purpose. &lt;a href=&quot;https://creately.com/blog/diagrams/what-is-an-affinity-diagram-guide-and-templates/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Affinity grouping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; works best when done as a team activity and it can be a rather fun one at that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Team members write down their ideas (anonymously if you’d like). Once there are a decent amount of ideas, group similar ideas together. The team then ranks or votes on each group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; Affinity grouping is best used by teams who are collaboratively trying to come up with a general direction and helps figure out what to build based on a collective idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;8. Story mapping&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.simplilearn.com/story-mapping-article&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Story mapping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is commonly used to define tests on new products which allow teams to collect the maximum amount of learning with the least effort. It’s a visual way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.fullstory.com/learn/video/fullstory-for-product-managers&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;develop your product&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; backlog and delineate sprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Create task-oriented &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-story-examples/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;user story cards&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Then, group them together into categories that follow a step-by-step workflow. Prioritize each group and break down the workflows into either releases or sprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; Story mapping is great to break larger concepts into workable tasks. It’s useful for determining what your minimum viable product (MVP) will look like and identifying the releases that follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Smart roadmap prioritization means smooth sailing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Captains may be the ones steering the ship while standing at the helm, but they can’t see everything from there. That’s why they listen to their crew, who can share what they see and give them a better perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With these eight tips, you can find your North Star, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital insights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to be objective and mission-driven with your product plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To enhance your product roadmap with a Digital Experience Intelligence Solution like FullStory, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;request a demo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and try it for yourself! &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to engage engineers in the design process]]></title><description><![CDATA[How do engineers, designers, and product teams play together more nicely?

If engineers saw the product — and the customer — the way designers do (and vice versa), overcoming challenges becomes much easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Companies are composed of engineers, marketers, executives and everyone has an opinion on design. Social media, devices, and world views have all changed the way we look at design. So how do we all play together, nicely? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What follows are aspirational and highly useful approaches to connect engineering and design. Like everything in product development, they are a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First, let’s walk through a quick definition of design. Setting context is critical because design directly impacts how we work with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The definition of iterative design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At its core, design is iterative problem-solving for people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The word &lt;a href=&quot;https://taazaa.com/quick-overview-of-design-in-software-development/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;iterative&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an important qualifier: it’s what keeps us humble. Designs won’t be right the first time and are a never-ending process as things evolve and change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If we don’t have an audience in mind or aren’t explicit about who we’re designing (and engineering) for, many things get lost along the way. Since design is iterative, it shouldn’t be a mystery to the rest of the team, especially since engineering solves problems all day long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve collected ten ways to create synergy between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/letting-design-into-the-heart-of-engineering/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;design and engineering&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in the hopes of bridging some much-needed gaps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory’s Digital Experience Intelligence solution brings disparate teams together by acting as a source of truth for customer experience data, making decision-making easier. Reach out to us for a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; free demo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to try it for your team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;10 ways to bridge the gap between engineering and design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Engage with engineers early on &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fundamentally, engineers are pragmatic in that they solve problems and make things work. The earlier the engineering team is involved, the quicker constraints and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;frustrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will become visible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to the digital experience, engineers look at errors in a different light than product management and design teams. While the team is concerned about aesthetics and optimization, engineers are focused on the system working &lt;i&gt;correctly&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sit with the engineers—early on. Listening to your team’s conversations is the easiest way to soak in knowledge, to get to know the product’s hard edges, build relationships, and bridge gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A helpful tool is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (DXI) solution like FullStory. When engineering is a part of the early process, the faster the designs get into the environment where the customer will interact on a browser, mobile device or tablet. The team will be able to see on-page signals like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/list-your-top-rage-clicks-and-dead-clicks/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rage Clicks or Dead Clicks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for a quicker resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Be the backend engineer’s BFF&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your &lt;a href=&quot;https://distantjob.com/blog/backend-engineer-backend-developer/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;backend engineer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is your best friend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They can help understand how the app’s infrastructure works, and the process of how tasks occur. They know how the sequence of events from a button-click on the front end affects the back end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ask the questions that a customer would ask, talk to them about the process and be mindful of their answers. A great way to do this is to take some engineers to lunch and pick their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Provide efficient deliverables&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Deliverables can be an easy place to figure out how to better engage with the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Delivering a final design as a stack of slides or a PDF, something the developer could click through, sounds good in practice. It’s how users experience the app: a series of screens, never seeing two different states at once. But it’s not conducive for working with the engineering world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Instead, present the various states of the interaction design side by side on a single canvas, it’s easier for everyone to see connections. It also means fewer files, since every state is contained in one PNG or PDF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For customers, a DXI platform like FullStory sees the design and engineering all in one and in action with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Even during the design process, this has oodles of benefits for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/8-ways-to-prioritize-product-roadmap/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;product roadmap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Have a modular view&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The context of the app is important for all parties involved. When the entire app is shown in context in every state, all the details tend to wash away and get overlooked. Showing them too much may lead to details being skipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050058893-Dashboards-Overview&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DXI platform dashboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can be used to invite teammates to your workflow. As a part of the onboarding flow, or permanently in the settings, you can remove all the surrounding context of the app, and allow the team to think of the areas where actions could be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When looking at things from a modular point of view, the right role fits into the process at the right time. Being transparent about the workflow and looking at it as a vignette helps to discover that insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Use code in your creative toolbox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Code is beautifully unforgiving: it either works or it doesn’t. Thinking of code as another tool in your creative toolbox can be immensely useful in broadening your understanding of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the design process, there are a lot of tiny puzzle pieces to work with and it can become difficult to see how they all fit together, whereas coding gives a chance for engineers to step in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, a problem may begin with high-fidelity mock-ups and wireframing, only to return to pen and paper. At times, there is a longer slog of problem-solving in design, when there may be a quick win with code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. Swap meetings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can’t be the only person on your team who understands customers and still expect your team to agree with every decision made, especially if the “problem” isn’t something inherently broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Invite the engineering teams to sit in on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/why-you-cant-do-a-user-interview-without-skin-in-the-game/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;usability studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; together. It may be an effort at first, but once they sit through one session, they’ll be hooked and want to watch the next round of studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the heart of this process, it’s about sharing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/empathy-customer-journey-maps/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;empathy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the ability to expose everyone that we work with to the feelings about the product. Taking the time to care about how others feel keeps the mind open to other valuable insights and viewpoints, which can lead to better decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;7. Stick around until the end&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s not ideal to wash your hands of something and say, “I’ve done my part, it’s on you now.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Inevitably, towards the end of a project, some new constraint or other will become apparent to your team which could have been circumvented if you had only kept your hands on the work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This extremely apt tweet from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RWD&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Responsive Design&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sums it up: “Thinking of design and implementation as separate concerns impact the quality of both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;8. Cozy up with constraints&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Creativity loves constraints, and there are a lot of ways to impose constraints on a design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set a deadline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give the problem to fewer people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a chat with engineering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
When you’re explicit and upfront about all the weird corner cases for a given interaction, it can lead to a design breakthrough, and due to the way engineers work, they can help you short-circuit the discovery of those constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The irony is that with code, it’s typical to check for the edge cases first. With design, you usually get to them last—so cozy up to constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;9. Make decisions just-in-time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The just-in-time philosophy stems from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://theproductmanager.com/topics/agile-product-management/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;agile development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; movement. In essence, it’s about waiting until you have real information before a decision is made about a problem with a lot of nuances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With complex problems and uncertainty, committing too early to a solution could lead to unhealthy assumptions. Deferring until there is tangible evidence lets you make decisions centered on something real. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a DXI solution, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/tag/use-cases/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital insights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are tangible enough to make decisions based on customer experience alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Team synergy: include, inform and accept&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A solid design process includes, informs, and pushes team members in the same direction. The key to creating an atmosphere of acceptance for design and engineering is to get everyone at the same table. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Maybe you have some of these tips in practice at your company, or maybe you’ve learned some new ideas. Hopefully, some takeaways are to engage with your team members early on, sit in on each other’s meetings, listen to different viewpoints and use technology to bring you together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

It will guide you through the process of taking stock of your experiences so far, documenting what you’ve learned about your work style and preferences, and creating an outline of the characteristics your ideal role/workplace would have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You don’t necessarily need to be facing a major decision to build your product career rubric—this five-part framework is useful at all points in your career journey. Whether you’re considering a shift or simply taking stock, this introspective exercise will help you understand what makes you tick as a product person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are five key themes to address when determining your ideal role and work situation: energy, environment, motivations, business, and craft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Open up a new doc (or, if you’re feeling zany, grab a pen and paper) and explore each of these key themes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Energy &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Different types of work energize or drain people in different ways. Likely, there are aspects of your work that you could do all day every day, and parts you could do without. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One helpful exercise for answering questions like these is to pull up your calendar and try to map some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leadingagile.com/2016/12/productivity-patterns/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;patterns of productivity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Then, work to identify your energy sources by answering these three questions: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time I felt drained at work was… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel most energized at work when I’m… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to quit my job when… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Environment &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next, it’s important to understand what you need from your work environment and structure. Do you prefer a culture where written conversations take precedence over meetings? Does it matter to you who your product management team reports up to? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Narrow down on your personal preferences with these prompts: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I excel in a company/culture where… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organization and/or team structure is important to me. Specifically…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need … and … from my leader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Motivations &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s likely that you’ll have different primary motivators at different stages of your career. For example, you may be in a season of life in which compensation is your key driver and you’re looking to level up. Here are three questions to help you think about your current motivations: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I think about a new opportunity, my top focus is…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, the one thing I’ve learned about myself is… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this life season, … is the most important thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Business&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Think about what type of business environment you enjoy most and how that influences the PM role—it could be related to company size, stage, product, or any number of other factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The role of a product manager can vary widely based on business type—for example, a product manager’s time at a SaaS company might be spent very differently than at an ecommerce company. Answer these questions to determine what type of business to look for: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy … about … types of businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I could get some experience in … industry, I’d be a stronger PM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do my best work in a … stage company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Craft&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When considering your craft, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/where-you-love-triangle-joff-redfern/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joff Redfern’s Product Manager Craft Triangle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a useful tool. Redfern’s triangle illustrates the concept that every PM has three voices in their head: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The General Manager voice is associated with the PM who loves building a business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Scientist voice loves discovering “truths” within the product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Artist voice loves creating the “soul” of a product &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Image via &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/where-you-love-triangle-joff-redfern/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joff Redfern&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Where you fall on the triangle can help you determine what type of company and role you’ll thrive in. Here are some additional questions to use to determine your own product voice:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d love coaching/mentoring to deepen my … skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me a company that does product well looks like… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of product management is… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part 2: Using the rubric to answer two big career questions &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that your rubric is fully fleshed out, you can put it to work. Here are two main questions that product managers will likely face at some point, and how the rubric can help approach them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Should I pursue people management? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Deciding whether or not to pursue people management can be a difficult decision. Three important things to consider as you think through this career decision are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflect back on the first question on the rubric—what makes you feel energized? If people aren’t part of that response, that’s a pretty clear sign to steer away from management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s holding you back from pursuing people management? Is it &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; manager? If so, have an open conversation with them about their reservations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that management inevitably comes with difficult decisions (and mistakes), are you in an environment and culture where you’d feel supported as you move into people management? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While choosing to become a manager &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;a serious decision, it’s also important to keep in mind that the transition isn’t irreversible. If you take the leap into management and then discover that it actually isn’t for you, there’s no rule against choosing another path. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How should I evaluate career opportunities and companies? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are, of course, many aspects to consider and many lenses to use when evaluating a career opportunity at any given company. A great rule of thumb is to look for &lt;b&gt;a company that values product.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can learn a lot about a company’s philosophy on product just though the interview process. For example, what’s the pace? Is the company thoughtful in learning about the diversity of your experiences? Is there a high hiring bar? How long have other product managers been with the company? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As taxing as a long and arduous interview process can be, it also says a lot about how much a company values the quality of its teams and employees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While we’re on the subject, if you’re looking for a new role at a company that cares a whole lot about product, FullStory is hiring. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/careers&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Check out open roles here.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;All in all, growing your product career with intention isn’t about picking the next skill to master or meticulously mapping out the next five or 10 years. It’s about understanding who you are and what makes you tick as a product person. Developing this self-awareness is a great step toward finding a role and company where you will excel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[5 quick ecommerce insights from retailX]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here are five lessons FullStory CMO Kirsten Newbold-Knipp learned from retailX 2021. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/retailx-2021-DXI</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/retailx-2021-DXI</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kirsten Newbold-Knipp]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Who doesn’t love a conference? The networking, the impressive speakers, the tempting afternoon cookies. I recently attended my first &lt;i&gt;in-person conference&lt;/i&gt; in more than a year, and honestly, I had missed every bit of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And retailX 2021, held August 24–25 in Chicago with a masked but highly engaged group of ecommerce professionals, was certainly one to remember. As a conference that keeps a finger on the pulse of the digital future of retail, I enjoyed the incredible lessons shared by world-class speakers and hallway conversations with attendees alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you didn’t make it to this year’s event, I’ve got you covered. Keep reading for five quick takeaways from the event—or watch the below video for some highlights!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The time is right for digital transformation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Far and above, digital transformation was an inescapable theme of the event—a common thread among many of the most insightful sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And for good reason. Digital transformation has been front-and-center for retail brands in the past years, and the dramatic shift to online and mobile commerce brought about by the pandemic has only magnified the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cases in point: Andrew Laudato, COO of Vitamin Shoppe, and Lizzy Ellingson, Chief Digital Experience Officer of David’s Bridal, discussed digital transformation in the context of contactless commerce and augmented reality in their sessions, which I found to be two of the conference’s most impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; Shoppers have sky-high expectations of retail brands. The best time to adapt was before the pandemic. The second-best time is &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uncertainty reigns supreme&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’ll be honest—wearing a face mask at a conference is a strange experience. While it’s anyone’s guess whether this will be the new normal of events or other IRL experiences, the general uncertainty around the shopping experience is likely to stick around for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While some might see complexity, smart retailers see an opportunity to better appeal to customers of all stripes. Essentially, covering all your bases today with some &lt;a href=&quot;https://jcand.co/blogs/the-accelerator/scenario-planning-retail-strategy-post-covid&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;retail strategy scenario planning&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; means opportunities are open to you, no matter which way the wind blows. That means leaning into digital and offline channels and ensuring they complement one another to provide flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One fascinating session featured Andrea Lisbona, Founder and CEO of D2C hand sanitizer brand Touchland. When COVID-19 first broke out, Andrea’s team managed to stay agile in light of global complexity by moving some manufacturing processes stateside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; Think through each possible scenario for the months to come and take steps to address any foreseeable concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Retailers can’t go it alone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Looking through the agenda of retailX, I was impressed at the mix of partners and agencies at the conference, right alongside the cast of retail leaders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Further to my point on scenario planning, ecommerce executives and their teams are borderline obligated to map out all the positive and negative eventualities stemming from a fast-changing world. Each one of those scenarios pulls companies into new platforms and a deeper stack of resources: order management systems (OMSs), marketing tools, fulfilment partners, and countless other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; In-house teams and capabilities can’t scale infinitely. Retailers need to keep an open mind around the tools they bring on to improve their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/analyze-digital-experience-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;analyze digital experience data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer journeys are getting more complex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Growing uncertainty and strapped resources make conducting business a lot more complex than ever before. Problems only get worse when those internal goings-on impact the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/empathy-customer-journey-maps/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer experience journey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially when teams can’t narrow in on and triage areas of opportunity with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/analyze-digital-experience-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital experience data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Andrew Laudato’s session, “How The Vitamin Shoppe Thrived Through COVID By Doubling Down on Digital,” unpacked his lessons regarding the impact the pandemic had on customer journeys, and how his team hit back quickly with big bets on digital and a focus on contactless commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key takeaway: &lt;/b&gt;Consider Andrew’s idea of the &lt;i&gt;minimally lovable product (MLP)&lt;/i&gt;, a departure from the minimum viable product. Too many MVPs stacked together, he warns, can degrade digital experience—which is why companies should use lovability as the benchmark instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Know &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;why&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; customers make decisions &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One compelling session was led by Stephen Stewart, Senior Manager of Merchandising and Analytics at Lowe’s—entitled “How Lowe’s Shifted to Digital-First Merchandising.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lowe’s situation during the pandemic was an accelerant for their business. Customers were stuck at home, pushing buyer behavior dramatically away from in-store transactions and toward mobile, digital, and BOPIS. Stephen’s team needed data not just around &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;people were doing on web and mobile properties but also critically &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; they were doing that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The steps Stephen and team took to accomplish that were impressive:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create consistent “North Star” KPIs for all teams to aspire to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest time and effort to reduce complexity of data and develop a unified reporting suite&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratize that “why” data through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One example—sales of garage floor mats were spiking, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showed people weren’t using them for mechanic work, but for home gyms. With that “why” data, his team could build promos to help people build gyms, add in new items, and take advantage of more growth opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key takeaway: &lt;/b&gt;Unearth the “why” behind user data to find new avenues for accelerating online growth and profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Ready to put DXI to work for your team? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Request your demo now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;

And that means excitement, anxiety, and ... &lt;i&gt;terror. &lt;/i&gt;‘Tis the season that will likely make—or break—your company’s annual revenue goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The good news? The 2019 shopping season is set to be one for the books:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2019 U.S. holiday retail sales are expected to hit &lt;b&gt;one trillion &lt;/b&gt;dollars—a first! (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/emarketer-2019-holiday-shopping-forecast-2019-11&quot;&gt;eMarketer&lt;/a&gt;), and ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of that &lt;b&gt;thousand billion in sales&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;13% will come from e-commerce&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition, 2019 brings another milestone: &lt;b&gt;e-commerce will be mobile first&lt;/b&gt; at last! Yes, representing 52% of digital orders, mobile will—finally—eclipse desktop for the season. And in addition, a huge 7 out of 10 digital visits will come from a mobile device (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2019/10/data-driven-holiday-predictions.html&quot;&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As for the rest of holiday sales, the impact of digital can&amp;#x27;t be understated: Over half of all sales are now digitally influenced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emarketer.com/content/in-store-sales-still-rule-but-digital-helps&quot;&gt;according to Forrester and Deloitte&lt;/a&gt;. That means your digital shopping experience—that is, how your customers experience your e-commerce site or app—is now linchpin to your success … and whether or not your e-comm team has a happy holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what can you do today to ready your site—or app—for the coming shopping frenzy? Let&amp;#x27;s take a look ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Begin at the End: Find and Fix Friction in the Checkout Flow&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First things first: You’re so busy you only have time to focus on the most critical aspects of your digital shopping experience. Focus on doing the work that will boost KPIs and conversions to drive revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Begin at the end. With the average cart abandonment rate &lt;a href=&quot;https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate&quot;&gt;cited at anywhere from 55% to 81%&lt;/a&gt;,  even well optimized e-commerce sites are sure to have opportunities to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Start by analyzing your checkout flow with your digital experience (DX) software of choice. (We’re partial to FullStory, of course.) Because FullStory stores and organizes user engagement down to on-page interactions—and even performance—it&amp;#x27;s easy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-fullstory-on-funnels/&quot;&gt;create a conversion funnel&lt;/a&gt; that strings together the digital behaviors you care about. You can even mix those digital experience events from FullStory with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/custom-events-in-fullstory/&quot;&gt;your own custom events&lt;/a&gt; (such as those from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tealium.com/&quot;&gt;Tealium&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://segment.com/&quot;&gt;Segment&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What you’ll end up with is a clear visualization of your funnel—and a few hints at where folks are dropping off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For those with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/conversions-by-fullstory/&quot;&gt;FullStory’s new Conversions product&lt;/a&gt;, you can use FullStory to analyze your funnels for you, illuminating statistically significant opportunities for improvement. For example, Conversions will reveal if a customer struggle—revealed through &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/a&gt; or poor page performance—is holding many shoppers back as well as how much it&amp;#x27;s impacting your metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you prioritize what’s most important, you have the power to “zoom in” and replay a few sessions so that you can confirm the problem. And with all that digital experience context, you&amp;#x27;ll be sure to have ideas for immediate fixes, optimization, or future A/B tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Optimize Performance So Heavy Traffic Doesn’t Bring You Down&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If this section had a theme song, it would be “Under Pressure.” It’s not just how you feel when looking at your web hosting bills: it’s how your site feels when your traffic suddenly ramps up 10x. Will your site or app’s performance keep up under extreme traffic conditions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Performance has a huge effect on e-commerce KPIs: for example, when Tempur-Pedic reduced their site load times by 20%, they saw their &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/2-tips-for-faster-websites-and-online-stores/&quot;&gt;average order value increase by 14%&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#x27;re not optimizing performance, you&amp;#x27;re leaving money on the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So how do you keep your finger on the pulse of performance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re a medium-to-larger retailer and planning to offer doorbuster specials from Thanksgiving Day to Black Friday and on into Cyber Monday, you must 👏 do 👏 load testing 👏. Many web serving setups aren&amp;#x27;t designed to handle sudden, huge spikes in traffic; they&amp;#x27;re designed for consistent traffic that&amp;#x27;s more or less predictable. Load testing software emulates the traffic of hundreds or thousands of users on your site, poking and prodding to find areas where performance suffers. We like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blazemeter.com/&quot;&gt;Blazemeter&lt;/a&gt;, but there are tons of load testing solutions out there to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You might also consider tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://calibreapp.com/&quot;&gt;Calibre&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://rigor.com/&quot;&gt;Rigor&lt;/a&gt; for ongoing performance monitoring. They can even measure the page load speed for an entire shopping cart flow, such as &lt;i&gt;Home Page &amp;gt; Search for an Item &amp;gt; Add to Cart&lt;/i&gt;, as we’ve done here in Rigor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, next time you’re in FullStory, turn on FullStory Dev Tools. Dev Tools offers you insights into page performance from &lt;i&gt;real users—&lt;/i&gt;not synthetic traffic as with other performance monitoring services. With FullStory, you even get a Network Analysis View that reveals the requests made by the browser and how long each request took.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/performance-issues-got-you-down-turn-on-new-dev-tools-in-fullstory/&quot;&gt;Learn more about Dev Tools in this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Mobile First Mobile Ground Zero&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;E-commerce has gone from “mobile first” to &amp;quot;mobile ground zero.&amp;quot; Last year (2018), mobile devices accounted for 67% of digital traffic on Black Friday—and nearly 1 out of every 2 orders (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/nikkibaird/2018/11/28/every-result-you-need-to-know-about-black-friday-cyber-monday-and-holiday-2018-so-far/#6712bbc84eb5&quot;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;). This year, as noted earlier, mobile orders will outpace desktop at 52% and mobile traffic will peak out at 75%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can expect mobile volumes to kick up right after everyone’s had their turkey dinner. Just don’t expect your mobile shoppers to be in a relaxed state of mind. In a study examining data from across the web, Google discovered 53% of mobile visitors abandon a page if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. How thin is a mobile shopper&amp;#x27;s patience going to be when they’re trying to hunt for the best deals in between bites of pumpkin pie?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s what you should do: &lt;b&gt;Build a conversion funnel for your mobile shoppers.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In FullStory, look to the left bar and click on “Mobile.” This will build a segment of your users who experienced your site or app on a mobile device. From there, construct your conversion funnel similar to how you did in &lt;b&gt;.1&lt;/b&gt; above. This could be the checkout flow if you want to examine mobile conversions. Or build out a funnel to your highly marketed “Black Friday deals” page—or your Store Hours and Store Location page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Remember that a conversion on mobile may not be a purchase. Rather, a mobile conversion may just be the critical preliminary steps that gets that highly valued customer into your brick and mortar retail store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Account for a Variety of Browsers and Screen Sizes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Screen size is no small thing, especially since your users are coming from all types of devices, computers, browsers, and operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Review your checkout funnel using each of the big mainstream browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, MS Edge, and Opera. Now set your screen resolution as low as it will go and do it again. Now switch to a different operating system and do both of those steps again. Now jump on an iPad and do it. A windows tablet. An Android phone. An iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can see where I’m going with this.  Just make sure your shop looks good, or at the very least works, on every combination of browser and device your customers could possibly be using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I know what you&amp;#x27;re thinking: this is impossible. Take heart! While you could do all this manually, you could also pop open FullStory and look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/screen-resolution-breakdown/&quot;&gt;the screen resolution breakdown&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, FullStory has filters that let you select replays from customers on a particular browser and device, such as Chrome on Windows, or Safari on iPhone. Watch those sessions and take note of any glaring errors or rendering problems. Then, make sure your fixes are pushed before holiday shoppers rush in!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We can watch sessions from every combination of browser and device with FullStory to make sure we’re optimized for 90% of the market.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;—Michael Moore, Moosejaw&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Help Your Customer Service Team Breeze Through Their Support Queue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One (huge) benefit to installing a digital experience platform that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;also has the ability to replay sessions&lt;/a&gt; is the boost to your ability to provide excellent customer service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why? Well, without session replay, you or your CS team may need to ask clarifying questions or request screenshots to resolve any less-than-obvious tickets. The more you need to email back and forth with a customer simply to understand their concern, the more frustrated the dear customer gets—&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the longer your queue becomes as new tickets pile up behind open ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once your service agents can replay the customer’s session, they see exactly what the customer tripped over, how they’ve already tried to resolve the problem on their own, and how you can help them achieve their goal. All but the most complex tickets can be closed in a single touch, freeing up your representatives to tackle the next problem (and maybe even giving them some breathing room to take a walk or grab some coffee).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your store provides real-time customer service via phone or live chat, look for DX software that also provides co-browsing capabilities. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/session-replay-customer-support/&quot;&gt;FullStory really shines for customer support&lt;/a&gt;, as our &lt;i&gt;Go Live&lt;/i&gt; feature gives CS agents the ability to drop in on a customer’s session in live time, letting them troubleshoot instantly while on a call or chat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What will your customer support professionals do with the time they save clearing their queue faster than ever with FullStory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go and Make Your Holiday Shopping Goals Come True!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hopefully these tips have prepared you for the oncoming rush.

We used our know-how from working closely with these clients to put together&lt;b&gt; four ways to make your digital experience stand out in the crowd&lt;/b&gt;, along with some &lt;b&gt;tips for how FullStory’s Digital Experience Intelligence can help you tackle those goals&lt;/b&gt; for your mortgage company.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Put humans first in your content&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Buying a home is complicated, and the mortgage process can be confusing, stressful, and, frankly, a bit scary. Those applying for a mortgage want to feel cared for and guided by someone they can trust. After all, it’s one of the largest financial transactions of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before the rise of digital lending, it was easier for mortgage companies to build that trust by connecting with applicants either through in-person or phone meetings. And while the online lending process is certainly more convenient, it can also feel faceless and robotic—the opposite of what a hopeful homeowner wants to experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For online lenders, finding the balance between digital convenience and customer-centricity is key. One way to do this is by putting your customer resources, like FAQs and contact information, front and center on your website. You can also tailor your messaging and marketing content to focus on human interaction and applicants’ needs to demonstrate your company’s commitment to giving clients the best possible experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;How DXI helps: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;With the ability to watch individual user sessions and create &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;custom user segments&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, Digital Experience Intelligence enables mortgage companies to create personal connections at scale. DXI creates the ability to understand exactly what users are experiencing on your website, both on a granular level and in aggregate, so that you can create smoother, more reliable digital experiences for them—ultimately increasing the chance of &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/conversions-by-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;conversion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emphasize your competitive differentiator &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are more online mortgage lenders than ever before, and just like with any digital business, it’s critical to find something that sets you apart from competitors. Each mortgage company has its own unique brand and offering—whether it’s the lowest rates, the best customer support, or the most advanced technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Find the thing that differentiates your lending company from the rest and make sure it’s conveyed clearly in your website’s messaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;How DXI helps: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence can give you valuable insights into what your visitors respond to on your website. Then, you can make changes to your website based on that knowledge to achieve even more engagement. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;For example, if you find that a high percentage of visitors are interacting with &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/how-much-house-can-i-afford&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;a budget calculator &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;on your homepage, consider making that feature even more prominent to encourage higher engagement rates. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on the first interaction &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The online lending industry is both competitive and fast-growing. Rocket Mortgage, for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rocket-companies-announces-first-quarter-results-301284878.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported 236% year over year revenue growth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier in 2021. And since your website is often a customer’s first peek into your company, their first impression becomes vitally important. It’s important to make the first step toward conversion as simple as possible—whether that step is filling out a form or simply clicking a “Learn More” button. After all, you can&amp;#x27;t win a conversion if they don’t take the first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many websites use testing to optimize calls to action (CTAs) on their websites. This can be as simple as testing form placements or wording (like “Learn More” vs. “Get Started”) or as complex as presenting entirely different website experiences to different users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall, the goal is to make the barrier to entry as low as possible for your potential customers. Instead of requiring a litany of information from prospects, many websites require the bare minimum for a team member to take action on the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;How DXI helps: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Detailed &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-fullstory-on-funnels/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;funnel analysis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; can be a huge help in understanding why your users do or don’t engage with your content. Mortgage companies can use funnels to analyze hyper-specific segments of customers to unravel their behavior and make them more likely to convert. For example, you could set up a funnel that analyzes a single form on your website, and measure step-by-step how a customer engages with the form to weed out pain points.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lean into dashboards &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Different types of loan seekers take different paths to conversion on lending websites. For example, first-time home purchasers might do more comparison shopping among lenders as they learn the ins and outs of the home buying process, while a more experienced shopper might have a clearer idea of what they’re looking for from a lender. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For online mortgage companies, identifying and analyzing the behaviors of different types of shoppers can be informative for creating personalized experiences based on a shopper’s specific needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;How DXI helps: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Using &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/5-product-management-dashboards/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dashboards&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; in your DXI tool can help you monitor the different types of customers who are visiting your site with continuous, in-depth reporting on how each segment of users behaves on your site. This data gives you the ability to identify key differences in the different types of loan seekers and streamline their paths to purchase. Additionally, Dashboards help cross-functional teams work together more seamlessly by providing high-level metrics, like session length and conversion rates, at-a-glance. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dxi-globally-dispersed-teams/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Find out more about how Digital Experience Intelligence keeps remote teams in sync in this blog post.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How OKRs and Agile Methodologies Work Together | FullStory Live]]></title><description><![CDATA[Find out the pros and cons of OKR and Agile, tips on how they can work together, and which works best for your team on this episode of FullStory Live.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/okrs-and-agile-at-fullstory/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/okrs-and-agile-at-fullstory/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hunter Garrett]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2019 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You got to find the process that works best with the chemistry and makeup of your team.

I&amp;#x27;m Hanna with FullStory and we&amp;#x27;re here for another edition of FullStory Live here on LinkedIn. Thanks for joining us. I&amp;#x27;m here this afternoon with Kyle Henderson a Senior Product Manager here at FullStory. Thanks for being with us Kyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Oh my pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;So before we get started, a few notes. As a reminder, this is a live session so please feel free to add comments below. If you have any questions, we&amp;#x27;ll get to those later on. We&amp;#x27;re going to be talking today about OKR cycles and sprints and how those can work together. So Kyle to kick things off, can you tell me a little bit about your background before you joined us here at FullStory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Certainly. So my background in product management crosses a number of different startups across the last 15, 20 years. Also spent some time working in product research and management at Nokia and some larger companies as well. But have spent a lot of time in the user experience space and the analytic space and that&amp;#x27;s part of what attracted me to come to FullStory. So that&amp;#x27;s the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;And what attracted you to being a product manager?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Oh I think because it&amp;#x27;s one of those interesting roles that is so ill-defined that you&amp;#x27;re allowed to go and get stuff done. And I just like being action first and it just works for my personality. I don&amp;#x27;t mind making decisions and having to pull people together to get stuff done. So works with PM-ing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Definitely. So we&amp;#x27;re talking about OKRs and sprints today. I feel like it&amp;#x27;s appropriate to make some sort of comment about you&amp;#x27;re an ultra marathoner and we&amp;#x27;re talking about sprints. So there&amp;#x27;s an interesting dynamic there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Yes sprints are great for speed training. It allows you to get a faster pace when you do long runs. But I can&amp;#x27;t say that I was ever good on the track in high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Okay. All right, that&amp;#x27;s fair. So talk to me a little bit about OKRs and sprints. It sounds like there&amp;#x27;s some tension there historically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah so first what is an OKR? So this is a management and alignment system that was popularized by Andy Grove of Intel and it stands for objectives and key results. And it&amp;#x27;s very good at helping define what the business wants to achieve and then also saying, how do we measure that we achieved it or didn&amp;#x27;t achieve it? Hence, the objective and the key result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Now those typically are kind of longer term plans. Maybe this looks at a few quarters. It could even look at an entire year. And it starts to play with schedules a certain amount. Where on the other side you have kind of Agile methodologies which sprints live inside, whether you want to do scrum or some other kind of more branded Agile approach, but this concept of being very flexible, responsive to your customer set, your user needs, and being able to in a very nimble, Agile fashion, execute quickly and deliver quickly to figure out what works and doesn&amp;#x27;t work. Hence, the idea of sprinting to get something out the door and get feedback on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Now, one is very flexible and responsive and doesn&amp;#x27;t have necessarily a whole lot of roadmap, while the other is very oriented towards a longer term roadmap and planning. And often organizations find those in conflict because how do I say I&amp;#x27;m going to get something done a year from now when I don&amp;#x27;t know what&amp;#x27;s important next week? That&amp;#x27;s why there&amp;#x27;s a little bit of conflict at times and people have to figure out how to make these two things work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah definitely. So let&amp;#x27;s talk about ... We&amp;#x27;ll talk about OKRs first and then we&amp;#x27;ll talk about Agile. So you defined OKR as objectives and key results. We use those here at FullStory and I personally have found them to be really helpful for thinking through, how do we solve big challenges in a short period of time. What do you see as the benefits of working through an OKR cycle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;So I think the first major benefit is it creates a lot of cross organizational alignment. It tells you what the business objective you want to achieve is. And it also tells you how we&amp;#x27;re going to measure if we achieved it or not. And that can flow down quite easily. So let&amp;#x27;s say an objective is, define, launch and collect 1,000 customers for a new product. And I&amp;#x27;m just saying I want to be able to do that by the end of the year. Well a key result is, 1,000 customers signed up. Another key result could be being able to say we released all MVP features and then additional fast follows of some sort. Whatever you want to define it as. But what&amp;#x27;s helpful about that is you can start to see okay, well me as in marketing or me as in product, or me as an engineering or in commercial sales, I can see like oh, if I want to help the company be able to get 1,000 customers, I can kind of break that down and so oh, my portion of being able to deliver against that metric is I need to make a feature as an engineer or as a product marketing I need to create the position and the messaging around that feature to communicate value to the end customer. So it becomes easy to align to what the company wants to achieve with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah I totally agree. And I think also we&amp;#x27;ve talked a little bit in other LinkedIn live sessions about our watch words here at FullStory and one of those is clarity. And for me I think OKRs are really clarifying because you do get that visibility into what&amp;#x27;s our business&amp;#x27; priority and then understanding how I as an individual contributor or as a team can help us track towards those goals. What do you see as the challenges with OKRs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;The challenges often I find with OKRs is the expectation that it drives all work versus placing importance on certain work. Often companies start with the OKRs of like the highest level. So you may have OKRs only at the company level, not like at the department level or like squad level. You don&amp;#x27;t go that low. And if you&amp;#x27;re thinking that you want to use OKRs to drive all activity, it could be then quite difficult to a certain extent because cycles become longer because you want this to be a methodology used across the entire org and it also requires a lot more planning in advance. So you start to lose some of the flexibility you may have been used to prior to going into an OKR process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah definitely. And you&amp;#x27;ve worked under OKR structures at other companies as well, so you have lots of experience with this. Let&amp;#x27;s talk about Agile or sprints. How do you define that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;So don&amp;#x27;t nail me to the wall too hard on this one. But let&amp;#x27;s just generally describe Agile methodologies as approaches that typically have something that looks like a backlog of requests from customers, users, commercial, et cetera, et cetera for changes or updates to a product. And the thought that on a weekly ... No, every two weeks short cycle I&amp;#x27;m going to pick which of those requests seem to be most important, define them, develop them, and release them and see if they are successful or not by whatever success criteria I set. The idea there is I&amp;#x27;m going to iterate so quickly that even if I am imperfect in knowing what is the great value I can deliver, I will through rapid feedback from my customer set and my stakeholders be able to get to the right feature faster than if I tried to do like a traditional waterfall or potentially like a longer planing cycle of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah definitely. So obviously the ability to move fast and be nimble would be a benefit. What are some other benefits you see?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Other benefits are it works really well when you want to talk about organizing work on like a daily basis or like shorter term weekly basis. So often situations may have squads or smaller teams or smaller departments, where let&amp;#x27;s say you would range from like three people to like 40 people. And this can be very helpful and still very wieldy, like you could do a very good job with managing what do we want to focus on this week? What is it specifically that we want to develop and launch? And when are we going to actually put it in customer&amp;#x27;s hands? And it&amp;#x27;s very clear and well defined because you&amp;#x27;re working on these small bite size bits of work. And everyone knows, like at the end of the week was I successful or was I 80% successful at getting done what I said I was going to get done? But longer timelines that can lose sight of what you&amp;#x27;re trying to accomplish or what you&amp;#x27;re trying to accomplish can change a little bit and it gets tough to understand and manage day to day work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. So it sounds like the biggest challenge probably is having that longer perspective on what are you doing, what are you trying to accomplish, how is success measured over a longer period of time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Got it. So obviously they sound very different. But your perspective is you think that there is a space where they can actually be complementary, correct?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, I think they actually work very well from kind of the perspective of meeting in the middle. I think OKRs, from my experience, work very well when you want to talk about entire company level objectives or department level objectives. And then more Agile methodologies work quite well when you&amp;#x27;re wanting to talk about daily, weekly, every two week work focus projects. How do I actually get stuff out the door? Now where I think they can meet is when you say, I don&amp;#x27;t think one should completely control or organize the company or the other. So from my perspective and what has been very successful for me in the past is working on quick cycles like Agile with sprints, but in every sprint we do, saying divide it. Only half of this sprint is going to be dedicated to work that is oriented towards an OKR in some way. And the other half of the work is going to be dedicated to whatever other stakeholders think is important for quick turnaround. So that I&amp;#x27;m getting that kind of incremental flexible Agile responsiveness to customers in the market. But I know I&amp;#x27;m also getting measured progress against what my bigger longer term plan is. And this has a big impact when you want to talk about what size company you are, like am I an early stage company or am I a big enterprise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;There are pros and cons to different sized companies and which methodology matches and how you should transition over time. But generally speaking, I think it&amp;#x27;s powerful when you decide to split between the two and you get the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah definitely. I think that makes a lot of sense if we think of ... We talk a lot about OKRs here as being big boulders that we want to chip away at, large projects. And you&amp;#x27;re saying that the sprints could be sort of the smaller pieces that fill in around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;There&amp;#x27;s an analogy, if you guys are SpaceX fans or any of these companies that are making micro satellites ... This is really intriguing to me. I&amp;#x27;m going to nerd out on this. These constellations of micro satellites are awesome now. Like they&amp;#x27;re getting fired up into the lower earth atmosphere and they&amp;#x27;re taking photos of the entire earth every single day now. And the only reason they&amp;#x27;re up there is like when SpaceX launces a massive satellite with a big payload, there&amp;#x27;s a lot of empty space that can&amp;#x27;t be filled with heavy weight stuff. These micro satellites are like shoebox size. Like getting shoved in everywhere. So think of it as like big efforts of work can get major boulders chipped away, which are like getting the big satellite up there. But then there should be lots of little ride alongs along the way, which are pushing the ball forward across the entire landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re thinking in terms of product prioritization, I think a lot of organizations at one point or another struggle with tech debt. Where they have sort of that lingering issues that they&amp;#x27;re chipping away at. They&amp;#x27;re not necessarily big projects, but they may have smaller sort of initiatives that always need to be a focus. How do you think that fits into this framework that you&amp;#x27;re describing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;So my specific experience on that from the PM perspective, having worked with engineering managers and different squads, when we got to sprint planning each week we would say, I as the product manager am going to take 50% of the points and I&amp;#x27;m choosing to divvy up half of that towards some of my big OKR stuff. And I have a lot of little small things I want to bring that are product oriented, maybe slight tweaks to features that I&amp;#x27;m going to fill in. Now engineering, you own 50% of this sprint. What do you want to bring? What&amp;#x27;s important to you? What are your projects or your epics or your small things, your tech debt? And then we all bring in together and if it&amp;#x27;s more than 100% we start negotiating back and forth on what&amp;#x27;s the value doing what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, interesting. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;So there&amp;#x27;s always space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. And I&amp;#x27;d love to hear from those of you who are watching online if you have any thoughts about OKRs and what works or doesn&amp;#x27;t work with them or if you&amp;#x27;ve worked in sort of this dual framework that Kyle is describing. We&amp;#x27;d love to know your thoughts and questions. It sounds like there&amp;#x27;s a lot of benefits from working with both OKRs and sort of a spring or Agile approach. Certainly there are challenges as well. Can you describe some of those for us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Often challenge is around sprinting and more Agile approaches. It happens so quickly and so many little things can get done, it becomes difficult to create visibility for the rest of the org about what&amp;#x27;s shipping, what went out to production, what problems got fixed. Unless someone like customer support is specifically watching an issue, they may not know it got resolved. So that&amp;#x27;s a challenge because there&amp;#x27;s just so much little stuff happening all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;A challenge on the OKR side is that unless something is really called out as a big, meaningful project that&amp;#x27;s going to push the business forward, it doesn&amp;#x27;t necessarily get the spotlight and doesn&amp;#x27;t necessarily get also visibility and awareness. You could have medium or smaller sized projects that have a big impact, but because they didn&amp;#x27;t get called out in some special way they kind of fell out of the scope and the area of awareness for the rest of the org as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Any other questions on that part?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;I mean, I think for me that last point is really interesting because we talked with Justin Dilley a couple weeks ago about working cross functionally and part of that is helping the people feel like they are having a valuable contribution. So if you are having smaller projects or things that aren&amp;#x27;t being called out on an OKR spreadsheet or being celebrated as wins, it can be challenging to motivate people. How do you deal with that as a PM?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;This might be going into a separate topic for a completely separate live session. But I have found that using this tool called ... And it comes from the Agile space to a certain extent of focusing on epics and understanding roadmaps in two different ways. There&amp;#x27;s the business objective roadmap and things you want to accomplish, and then there&amp;#x27;s the epics of work that have to get done. And those are like all these major projects. So by giving visibility and keeping your release schedule more oriented towards these large arcs of work and being able to attach certain people to it, it gives you that kind of medium level visibility where tracking these epics lets me call out people as good job, you do great work here. It&amp;#x27;s not something essentially that&amp;#x27;s going to get called out at an entire company meeting, but in a department meeting we&amp;#x27;ll call that out. And then at the lowest sprint level you still get that weekly planning meeting, or at the end of the week when you do a debrief on how the sprint went where you can do call outs as well. So you have a small, medium, and a large space that you can always be giving the little applause for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, definitely. I know that as we&amp;#x27;ve grown at FullStory, the way in which we&amp;#x27;ve done OKRs has evolved as well. And I&amp;#x27;m sure that the approach that you&amp;#x27;re describing there&amp;#x27;s also an evolution that happens with growth. Can you talk a little bit about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve done a number of small startups from the first few people all the way up to several hundred people now and then worked at really large organizations, tens of thousands of people. And often you&amp;#x27;ll find seed stage, early stage startups are very naturally kind of on the Agile side. You&amp;#x27;ll have a founder who has a product vision, already maybe has ideas in their mind&amp;#x27;s eye of how the product is used and how it works and it&amp;#x27;s very feature oriented from the beginning. And that early stage company isn&amp;#x27;t thinking about the business objective other than make this feature and find someone who wants to pay for it. And that&amp;#x27;s great at the beginning when you&amp;#x27;re trying to start building a foundation and start finding some customers to learn from. But let&amp;#x27;s say you&amp;#x27;ve had some success, like you&amp;#x27;ve signed up 100,000 customers over a year or two. You&amp;#x27;re now getting a situation where you need to actually be doing more business planning, you need to be doing more objective setting, and communications about how your business is going to grow because you now have investors involved, you now have much larger customers who are asking about your roadmap and what are you planning on doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;And this is where you start to have a need for things like OKRs. When I need to project out farther what we&amp;#x27;re going to be focusing on, what we&amp;#x27;re going to try and deliver for our customers. And by deliver I don&amp;#x27;t mean features, I mean what new business processes that are value we&amp;#x27;d want to unlock. So at FullStory we want to make it so when you use FullStory as a customer you understand the complete user experience and all the measurement around that. And I didn&amp;#x27;t tell you what feature that was, but saying that&amp;#x27;s something I want to deliver. Something like once you get to be a bigger organization you need to start setting these bigger objectives. So as you grow you need more and more OKR stuff. But you also don&amp;#x27;t want to lose the quick Agile approach that can really stay at the small team level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. And you&amp;#x27;ve talked a little bit about squads. It seems like that&amp;#x27;s an important part of this, is having a small, closely connected group of people who are working towards a similar project or problem right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah and squads from an organization perspective of maybe it&amp;#x27;s 10 people or less. There&amp;#x27;s someone who&amp;#x27;s the product representative, someone who&amp;#x27;s an engineering representative, depending on what they want to focus on, design. And it&amp;#x27;s making sure that the roles are representative to be able to do successful Agile sprints so that you have the input from product needs, you have the input from engineering potential and limitations, and you also have the input in terms of design and experience you want to support. And making it so that it&amp;#x27;s like its own little entity is helpful because it can get stuff done without having to rely on other parts of the org as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. So let&amp;#x27;s say people are watching, they&amp;#x27;re sold, they&amp;#x27;re like this seems like a great idea. How do you recommend people get started?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re small, just start with Agile and I&amp;#x27;d say once you get up to 30 or 40 people start thinking about I want to set company level OKRs quarterly. And pick only two to three and just get started that way. Create that alignment across everyone so that anyone, while they&amp;#x27;re working on that daily basis or weekly sprint basis, can say is this value to the company, can say does it support our objective or KR, and understand that as a prioritizing power versus just I picked it because I think it&amp;#x27;s best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. And what about people who may be working within an OKR structure already and they&amp;#x27;re like ooh, this Agile thing sounds like it could be really useful. How might you go about creating buy in for that in an organization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Sometimes I think it&amp;#x27;s more simple to not try and start by getting buy in into the methodology, but start by just simply providing a few tools or processes for organizing weekly work. So even just coming in on Friday afternoon and saying &amp;quot;What got done this week? What did we think we were going to get done? What do we think was successful, not successful?&amp;quot; And being able to get that. And then asking what do you want to accomplish next week so that on Monday you come in and be like &amp;quot;Hey, these are the things we said we want to accomplish.&amp;quot; That&amp;#x27;s pretty much like having your sprint Kanban and your backlog to a certain degree and you&amp;#x27;re starting to get people to think about how do I move stuff out the door quickly, but also say what I can get done and measure if I got it done or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. You mentioned tools and processes. Do you have any tools that you think are essential for doing this type of work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;I always encourage to start manually. So get the post-it notes and put it on the wall and just say backlog, current sprint, QA, or release to production. Keep it super simple at the beginning because whenever you&amp;#x27;re trying a new process, if you can&amp;#x27;t do it when it&amp;#x27;s at its simplest, why would you expect to be able to do it at a larger scale with more complexity? So grow into it, don&amp;#x27;t try and bite off all of it at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;But then other great tools, I love Trello or spreadsheets, Clubhouse. I mean there&amp;#x27;s lots of tools out there that are either very flexible or very opinionated that could benefit you once you&amp;#x27;ve matured your thinking on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;I love that idea of just starting with the most basic process. I know that for me when I find new tools I&amp;#x27;m like &amp;quot;Oh my gosh, I want to use this&amp;quot;, and i don&amp;#x27;t often sort of think of okay, what&amp;#x27;s the structure here that this should be in and let&amp;#x27;s run the process before we adopt tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Because a lot of times you got to find the process that works best with the chemistry and makeup of your team. So you want to understand that to help you create your requirements for what the tool you pick is. So I need my process before I pick a tool versus I pick a tool, now let&amp;#x27;s work with their process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. I think another important piece is communicating really well either within a squad or across teams or to the whole company. What tips do you have for folks around communicating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Even if you use an online tool for your Agile sprints, I still encourage turn it into a physical thing, put it on the wall, make it so people just encounter it and get knowledge by accident. Like they bump into knowledge in some way. And some kind of space where you can literally see things moving. I don&amp;#x27;t mean like a digital space because I can always move a tab around. A physical space is very helpful. Additionally, I would say, and this is from the product perspective ... And I work with Hanna so please don&amp;#x27;t call me a hypocrite initially, but often in product management you end up having to talk about things two to three to 10 times more than you actually spend working on it because so much of that work is just about communicating and getting information out to people and going collecting information. So don&amp;#x27;t feel bad ever if you feel like you got too little actually done, if everyone knows about it. Because with everyone knowing about it that means you got feedback from everyone and what you did do is probably more on target than if you&amp;#x27;d spent nine tenths of your time doing it and only one tenth of your time figuring out what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. I think that&amp;#x27;s a really great point. I really think that PMs and product marketing as well are sort of these nice connective tissue roles where you spend so much time working with other people and communicating and make sure everyone&amp;#x27;s on the same page that there are some days I go home and I&amp;#x27;m like, &amp;quot;Did I do anything or did I just talk to a bunch of people today?&amp;quot; But that in and of itself is really important work if you&amp;#x27;re doing it well. That&amp;#x27;s critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. You can never underestimate the value of two minutes that changes someone&amp;#x27;s vector to be more on target. That scales. You could teach that. It makes everyone more on target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. I think that&amp;#x27;s great. One of the questions that we received is, &amp;quot;How important is it that OKRs be set at a product team level versus a company level? Should they always be one and the same?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kyle Henderson: &lt;/b&gt;They don&amp;#x27;t have to be one and the same. And this goes back to your question of how do you get started. I think this is really dependent upon the size and complexity of your organization and what I was saying before is if you&amp;#x27;re small and you&amp;#x27;ve never done OKRs before, just start at the company level and then think about if you&amp;#x27;re doing some kind of Agile approach or whatever methodology you&amp;#x27;re using for planning, just think about how you organize the work to deliver on those OKRs. And as you grow, bring it to the department level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Well, thank you so much for being with us today. I really appreciate your time. Always fun to chat about OKRs and things like that. Thank you to you all for joining us, spending a little bit of your afternoon with us. Hopefully you learned something and have some ideas to take back to your team. As I mentioned this is I think the third in a series of four LinkedIn live sessions so we&amp;#x27;ll be back next week with Agata Bugaj. So please tune in for that. If you want more updates on product management or other content that FullStory&amp;#x27;s producing, please follow us on our LinkedIn page. Until next time, see you later.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Holiday code freezes: Unwrapping the pros and cons]]></title><description><![CDATA[Code freeze has been a standard practice for ecommerce sites for years.

And according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/infographic-online-shopping-habits/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;our recent survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 90% of U.S. consumers plan to shop online the same amount or more than they did last holiday season.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For online retailers, all that online shopping means a surge in traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The process of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/ecommerce-holiday-shopping-guide/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fortifying your ecommerce site for holiday shopping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might include ensuring your checkout flow is working smoothly, testing site performance, and ensuring you have a back-up plan for items that are out of stock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At many retail organizations, holiday prep might also entail deciding whether or not to launch a code freeze ahead of higher traffic—a decision that’s becoming more and more contentious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In previous years, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegood.com/insights/holiday-code-freeze&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;code freezes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during the holiday season were standard practice for many ecommerce teams. However, with more widespread adoption of Agile methodologies and evolving QA processes, some organizations now see code freezes as antiquated and unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re an ecommerce product manager weighing the pros and cons of code freeze, this guide is for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read on to explore the risks and benefits of enacting a code freeze on all or part of your ecommerce site this holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is a code freeze? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flagship.io/are-code-freezes-still-relevant/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Code freeze&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a term used by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/engineers-guide-dxi/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;engineering teams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to refer to a period of time in which none of a website’s code is changed or modified. Many companies, ecommerce included, choose to go into a code freeze when high site traffic is expected—like during the holiday shopping season—to avoid technical issues that could arise if new code is deployed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are different levels of code freezes that can be enacted based on your organizations preferences and goals: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hard freeze&lt;/b&gt;: This is the most extreme type of code freeze. In a hard freeze, the freeze is implemented at the deployment level, and developers temporarily do not have access to deploying the website’s code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Soft freeze: &lt;/b&gt;In a soft freeze, developers agree not to make any changes to code, allowing for exceptions that a hard freeze doesn’t. For instance, a product manager might say that a particular feature can still be worked on, but the rest of the site or app is off limits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Code frost: &lt;/b&gt;The most lenient version of a freeze, a code frost is a handshake agreement—rather than a hard-and-fast rule—between developers that far fewer changes will be made than usual. Some organizations implement a code frost ahead of a code freeze, so that work can wind down instead of coming to a sudden halt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additionally, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://simplicable.com/new/code-freeze&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;specification and feature freezes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pump the brakes on specific aspects of a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pros of going into a holiday code freeze &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Safety net against new bugs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When your site is likely receiving more visitors than ever, the last thing you want to do is accidentally add a new bug into the mix. &lt;b&gt;Even though &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agile practices&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; and automated QA processes go a long way toward catching bugs while code is still in production, there’s no way to ensure that a piece of code is perfect before it’s been deployed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This means that, as long as new code is being deployed, new bugs have a chance of making it onto your site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helps maintain site performance despite traffic spikes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restricting changes to your site’s code protects you against service disruptions.&lt;/b&gt; During the holidays, your site likely has more shoppers with higher intent to purchase—making it an extremely inopportune time for your site to slow down or crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And while code freezes might fit cleanly in Agile methodology, many retailers choose to embrace site stability over innovative processes during such a critical season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opens up time to work on other site optimization projects &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A code freeze effectively forces your developers to press pause on making code-based improvements to the site—but there are still ways to move toward a better digital experience during this period. &lt;b&gt;Code freeze is a great time to do consumer research and analyze customer behavior with &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, you can still &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/ab-testing-digital-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;run A/B tests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during a code freeze. And since your site’s traffic is higher than average, you’ll get answers to your experiments in less time than you normally would.Then, you’ll have a set of new digital experience improvement projects in the pipeline when your code thaws after the holiday rush. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cons of enacting a holiday code freeze &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unexpected issues can impact timelines&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enacting a code freeze is a time-consuming process, and means incorporating additional moving parts to your roadmap&lt;/b&gt;—increasing the likelihood that something will go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, you might uncover a critical bug while preparing to implement a code freeze. Freezing an existing bug on the checkout page of an ecommerce site is not a good idea, but the fix itself could very easily throw off your timeline. This is just one example of how code freezes can impact your site roadmap and slow your team’s progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reduced developer productivity &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This argument against code freeze needs little explanation. &lt;b&gt;Code freezes require developers to essentially pause work on any ongoing projects&lt;/b&gt;—or, if they’re able to continue dev work, wait to ship new code until the freeze ends (which can lead to large, risky shipments later on). A code freeze can also impact productivity by interfering with momentum. Picking up a project after a month of inactivity can be challenging and time-consuming. However, a code freeze doesn&amp;#x27;t have to stop innovation. While &lt;b&gt;deploying&lt;/b&gt; new code may be temporarily on hold, many teams will continue to work on feature branches in the background, shipping new features after the deployment freeze is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risky code deployment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A code freeze creates a deadline—anything not shipped before the freeze begins will have to wait until the thaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This can lead developers to rush to finish in-production code in order to get it across the finish line ahead of the freeze&lt;/b&gt;—potentially leading to rushed code that’s more likely to have bugs or other defects that might have been found before shipment with more time for QA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;All in all, code freezes are right for some retailers and not for others. Whether or not to freeze code ahead of the holidays—or to what extent to freeze it—is a complex decision that should ultimately be made jointly by product managers and engineering teams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whatever you decide, higher site traffic makes the holiday season a great time to learn about user behavior and understand how to optimize your site’s digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you’re planning a code freeze or not, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/signup/?freemium&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;start a free trial of FullStory before your next big retail event&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so you don’t miss out on valuable DX data. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pivoting in crisis: How to deliver value to your customers right now and drive long-term loyalty]]></title><description><![CDATA[How can brands pivot quickly to meet changing customer needs?

You need to be open to the idea that their priorities may have shifted and the way you position your offering might have to shift to stay aligned with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Stating the obvious: We are all in uncharted territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As product folks, the &lt;a href=&quot;/customer-journey-maps/&quot;&gt;customer journeys&lt;/a&gt; we were focused on two weeks ago are likely completely irrelevant today. And these shifting sands will continue to be the reality for the foreseeable future. So what do we do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We show up for our customers in any way we can. That’s it. We shift focus so that we can deliver exactly what they need right now. In doing so, we build connection, affinity, and loyalty—we double down on the belief that if we are there for our customers now, they will be there for us in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this post, I outline two simple steps you can take to adapt—fast—to meet your customers&amp;#x27; changing needs. I look at three industries that are having to pivot quickly as traditional demand is flipped on its head: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customers/ecommerce-retail&quot;&gt;Retail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customers/finance&quot;&gt;Finance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customers/travel&quot;&gt;Travel&lt;/a&gt;. While I use these industries to illustrate specifics, keep in mind that the lessons shared in this post are applicable across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First things first: What do consumers care about right now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Understanding consumer motivations in a crisis moment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Stress triggers our survival instinct. This activates a fear response, which is governed by the limbic system. The limbic system is powerful and when we’re really stressed out, it can shut off our more rational cerebral cortex entirely. In times of crisis, our rational brains get hijacked and we slide down &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.masterclass.com/articles/a-guide-to-the-5-levels-of-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs&quot;&gt;Maslow’s hierarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory Customer Experience Manager Ben McCormack explains, &amp;quot;Two weeks ago, you might’ve thought I’m going to go to Publix where shopping is a pleasure. Today though, you’re going to go anywhere where you can get your very basic needs met (i.e. find toilet paper). You care less about flashy performance features. You just need what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;We’re seeing this as massive online retailers like Amazon and Walmart shift to prioritize essential items; non-essential items are being pushed out a month or more when it comes to shipping so that they can prioritize shipping what people need (or at least feel like they need) right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a fear state, we are more reactive, more emotional, and more focused on trying to reclaim control over the future. Because our logical brains have taken a backseat, we need extra guidance even in simple situations. We need more reassurance that our choices will benefit us, that we won’t regret them. And we need more guarantees that if we do make a choice, we can unmake it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is the state consumers are currently in. And brands that can provide an experience that truly meets consumers’ needs will set themselves apart. How you show up for your customers right now will have a lasting impact on how they view your brand in the months and years following this global crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 1: Identify your customers’ most important needs right now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your shoppers are likely in a stress mindset, trying to accomplish one of a few primary jobs. While we are still mid-crisis (i.e. coronavirus cases continue to grow), these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/&quot;&gt;jobs-to-be-done&lt;/a&gt; will revolve around (re)gaining a sense of control and a sense of security. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meet needs&lt;/b&gt;: Find and purchase a specific product with ease: Household necessities, groceries, work-from-home supplies, e-learning courses, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get information&lt;/b&gt;: Find information quickly to help them act with confidence: &lt;i&gt;Can I cancel my flight and get a full refund? How do I do it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Increase safety&lt;/b&gt;: Boost their sense of safety, both physical and psychological: &lt;i&gt;Can you assure me the food I’m getting delivered is handled and packaged with care?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comfort/Self-care&lt;/b&gt;: Escape reality, find relief, get distracted: TV / movie streaming, podcast listening, social media browsing, pet memes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You likely have information pouring in from different sources that can help you identify what your customers need right now. You’ll want to keep the above jobs-to-be-done in mind as you parse this information. This will help you categorize and organize your efforts (which will be useful in step two). To identify your customers’ most pressing needs, you should review:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trending search terms—what are people searching for when they land on your site? How are their queries changing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer support tickets and emails—what are people asking for? Are there new patterns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call center recordings and notes—why are people picking up the phone? Are there new patterns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media—are people resorting to Twitter and LinkedIn to solicit help? If so, what are they looking for? What is the sentiment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045159373-About-Funnels-&quot;&gt;Funnel behavior&lt;/a&gt;—what pages are people visiting on your site or within your app? Where are they dropping off?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/&quot;&gt;Frustration signals&lt;/a&gt;—where are people running into friction on your website or in your app?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news—your customers are staying up-to-date, make sure you are as well. Ever-shifting circumstances may influence what consumers care about tomorrow vs. today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you examine sources of customer feedback and behavior indicators, focus on information you can access quickly and easily. Don&amp;#x27;t get bogged down trying to review everything. Narrow your focus and look for anomalies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read through five call center transcripts and/or support requests. Look at tweets to your company from the past week. Pull a report to show your top visited web pages from the past three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep in mind that you will need to stay flexible as customer needs will continue to shift and evolve over the coming weeks. Take this into account as you move into step two: prioritize and act. Shipping small improvements and adjustments will likely be more beneficial (to your customers and to your business) than pursuing large-scale overhauls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 2: Prioritize and act—time to value matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In evaluating whether your digital experience is meeting current customer needs, ideas will begin to emerge. You should divide these ideas into two buckets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Fixes” &lt;/b&gt;or changes you need to make to ensure your experience isn’t having a negative impact on users, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Innovations” &lt;/b&gt;or opportunities to turn a perceived bug into a feature. For example, marketing thought leader Rand Fishkin has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sparktoro.com/blog/marketing-right-now-is-hard/&quot;&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt; for companies experiencing high demand and stress on their product inventory: “Tell folks you’re overwhelmed, and let them sign up to receive the next available shipment with information on when that’s coming.” Communication becomes a value add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Both Fixes and Innovations can be used to reduce pain—or the perception of pain—and provide reassurance, which are your main objectives right now. You should evaluate ideas using a prioritization system. I recommend looking at three factors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Size: &lt;/b&gt;How many customers will be positively impacted if we address this idea? Will our most valuable customer segments be positively impacted if we address this idea? Prioritize large impact over niche impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Potential: &lt;/b&gt;How bad are things right now? Is there a lot of room for improvement? You may want to prioritize ideas that allow for the biggest upswing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Difficulty: &lt;/b&gt;Is this an easy idea to ship? Is it complex technically and / or organizationally? Speed matters. Prioritize the ideas you can move forward quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the following section, I look at how brands in different industries can follow the above steps to change direction quickly and meet consumer needs in this present moment. Again, these examples are illustrative—think about how you can apply these steps to your business regardless of industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Retail: From promotional discounts to clear shipping terms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As of March 23rd, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/13-retailers-announce-temporarily-store-closures-to-fight-coronavirus-2020-3#gap-24&quot;&gt;more than 90 U.S. retailers&lt;/a&gt; had shuttered stores indefinitely to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. From Patagonia to Best Buy, Kohls to Crate &amp;amp; Barrel—brands that have historically operated both online and offline have had to shift gears and adopt an entirely online approach. At the same time, consumers confined to their homes are spending more and more time online, browsing, consuming, sharing. That said, they are also tightening their budgets in anticipation of an economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This means a couple of things for retailers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your shoppers may not be ready to convert right now. They may not be willing or able to purchase. But they are online. They are browsing. They are &lt;i&gt;window shopping&lt;/i&gt;. This means ample opportunity to engage with people—to invest in building connections and strengthening brand affinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers who are looking to buy need extra reassurance that buying from you and buying now is a choice they won’t regret. This is the time to shift focus from product descriptions to other value proposition points, like shipping times, packaging and delivery policies, return policies, and inventory updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thinking about the steps outlined above, here are a few actions you can take to improve the digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 1: Identify your customers’ most important needs right now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audit relevant sources of customer insight listed in step one above (e.g. trending search terms, customer support tickets, call center recordings, funnel behavior, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend time reviewing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-and-jobs-to-be-done-reveal-the-hidden-desire-paths-in-your-product/&quot;&gt;click paths&lt;/a&gt;: What are the top links people are currently clicking on your homepage? Pay particular attention to the areas that may be receiving a spike in visits, such as shipping terms and conditions, your return policy, branded content, delivery service updates—anything out of the ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedicate time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624154-Rage-Clicks-Error-Clicks-Dead-Clicks-and-Thrashed-Cursor-Frustration-Signals&quot;&gt;reviewing frustration signals&lt;/a&gt; related to the above journeys. Can you identify areas of confusion, missing information, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify common topics and FAQs from support calls and/or online chat teams—can you help customers answer these questions or accomplish these goals via your website? Can you make these self-service options more discoverable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 2: Prioritize and act—time to value matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjust your goals. You should always be monitoring conversion rates and revenue, but right now, you have an opportunity to invest in engagement that can spur long-term brand loyalty. Can you adjust your current goals or articulate new goals that are in line with shopper sentiment, satisfaction, and brand integrity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A/B test if possible. If &lt;a href=&quot;/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;customer feedback and interaction data point&lt;/a&gt; to a specific gap or opportunity, use that information to develop a hypothesis and test an alternate experience. Our friends at Optimizely &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.optimizely.com/2020/03/25/how-retailers-can-handle-online-order-growth-during-covid-19/&quot;&gt;compiled a list of test ideas here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s apply the same steps to a different industry: Finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Financial Services: From &amp;quot;Get a Quote&amp;quot; to highlighting key information&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For banks and financial services providers, this is a crucial moment to shape public trust. With money flowing into the financial system from stimulus packages and uncertainty about consumer debt obligations (e.g. making the next month&amp;#x27;s mortgage payment), individuals will want to understand how they will be impacted and supported. Your ability to provide clarity, transparency, and guidance to consumers is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“I expect that this will be one of the most pivotal moments in shaping public trust in banks since 2009. One point five trillion dollars has already been injected in stimulus into the financial system to keep it running smoothly. The public is going to be looking at this and want their own support. All that’s going to put banks’ actions to customers to employees to the community under a microscope,” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emarketer.com/content/covid-19-impact-financial-services&quot;&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Dan Van Dyke, research director, financial services at Business Insider Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For banks, lending needs are increasing as individuals and businesses face economic pressure. Loan repayment plans and terms are shifting and changing. And with social distancing rules in effect across the world, visits to physical branches will all but cease; consumers are turning to digital channels and many financial services providers are not prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For fintech, Van Dyke shares that digitally minded insurers will benefit from increased awareness and demand for their services. “This gives issuers the opportunity to shine with stand out services.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you own or contribute to the digital experience at a financial services company, communication is likely your number one priority. With so much changing everyday and with consumers uniquely focused on this space—you’ll want to shift energies toward seamless communication via digital channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 1: Identify your customers’ most important needs right now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review all sources of customer feedback, paying particular attention to your call centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the new patterns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What new jobs are customers trying to accomplish? What information are they seeking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the tipping point that triggers a phone call?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you help customers answer these questions or accomplish these goals via your website? Can you make these self-service options more discoverable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review click paths on your site and / or mobile app: What are the top links people are currently clicking on your homepage? Pay particular attention to the areas that may be receiving a spike in visits, such as FAQs, lending information, information around rates, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedicate time to reviewing frustration signals related to the above journeys. Can you identify areas of confusion, missing information, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 2: Prioritize and act—time to value matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus on fixing points of friction that can help to reduce call center volume. Answer: Does solving for this particular problem help get customers closer to answering their question or accomplishing their job faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communicate in human terms. All industries have jargon but financial terms are often complex. Remember: Customers are in a stress mindset and the stakes are high when it comes to finance. Anything you can do in this moment to simplify and clarify will go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The last industry I’ll focus on in this post is travel and hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Travel &amp;amp; Hospitality: From optimizing the booking flow to optimizing the cancellation flow&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we work with many companies in Travel and Hospitality—one of the industries that has been hit hardest by the COVID-19 crisis. Travelers are scrambling to change, postpone, and cancel travel plans. They are worried about their safety, they are worried about sunk costs, they are disappointed and anxious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It is important to note people who are cancelling plans now are not lost. While many people are opting to save the funds they had earmarked for travel, 33% of U.S. and U.K. travelers plan to re-book their vacations at a later date. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.globalwebindex.com/chart-of-the-week/travel-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/&quot;&gt;Fourteen percent&lt;/a&gt; plan to vacation in their own country and 12% plan to spend the money on day trips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;People still want to travel. They still plan to travel. Which means that companies in Travel and Hospitality need to work hard &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt; to earn that future business. For those that have long prioritized the “Book Now” conversion flow, it’s time to rethink everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“It’s strange to shift focus from optimizing your booking flow to optimizing your cancellation flow, but that’s what we’re encouraging our customers to do right now,” explains Stephen Krauska, FullStory Customer Success Manager. “If you can create an experience that allows people to cancel or change their travel plans online, you’re making their lives a little easier at a crucial time. And you’re reducing your own operating costs by saving precious call center time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can create an experience that allows people to cancel or change their travel plans online, you’re making their lives a little easier at a crucial time. And you’re reducing your own operating costs by saving precious call center time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 1: Identify your customers’ most important needs right now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledge that people don’t have a choice in most cases: They have to change and cancel travel plans. Start from a place of compassion and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spend time reviewing click paths: What are the top links people are currently clicking on the homepage? Pay particular attention to people who eventually navigate to “Help” or “Cancel” areas—how long did it take them to get there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dedicate time to reviewing frustration signals related to the above journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify common topics and FAQs from support calls and / or online chat teams—can you help customers answer these questions or accomplish these goals via self-service? Can you make these self-service options more discoverable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 2: Prioritize and act—time to value matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjust your goals. For example, can you increase the percentage of people who are able to make changes to or cancel their travel plans using online self-service? Can you decrease call volumes to your support centers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No matter how counterintuitive it seems, put your customers first&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every industry, every individual is feeling the impact of this crisis. Now is the time to look beyond aggregate numbers and re-focus on the people behind the clicks, bounces, and conversions. Now is the time to make creative, compassionate adjustments to your digital experience and make sure you are helping customers meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a final takeaway, keep this list of questions in mind as you review customer behavior in this moment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I make this easier…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I make this clearer…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I use simpler language and shorter sentences…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I reduce time-to-job-done…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Act with empathy, act with patience, act with generosity, act quickly. And you will see the benefit—in short-term customer support cost reduction and in long-term increased customer connection and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[7 key product management metrics and KPIs (and how to improve them)]]></title><description><![CDATA[For SaaS product managers, defining and tracking key metrics is critical to guiding and adapting product development. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/product-management-metrics-and-kpis</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/product-management-metrics-and-kpis</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article summary: &lt;/b&gt;For SaaS product managers, defining and tracking KPIs and metrics are critical steps in effectively guiding product development. In this introductory guide, we explore seven metrics for product managers to consider, and tips for how to improve them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Behind nearly every successful technical product lies a knowledgeable, analytical, intuitive product manager. Effective product managers wear a multitude of hats, juggling responsibilities including conducting customer interviews, user testing, feature prioritization, roadmap planning, resource allocation, and &lt;b&gt;defining and tracking key metrics&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This last function is key to guiding and adapting product development and rollout. While certainly part science, using metrics effectively is also an art. Interpreting, weighing, and giving life to cold numbers is vital for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;data measures to have real, usable meaning&lt;/a&gt;. As explained by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42425793-the-change-agent-cio&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;author and UX designer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Molly Norris Walker, “The numbers should speak for themselves, but they don’t.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s an ever-growing number of ways for SaaS PMs to measure product and process performance. Here&amp;#x27;s an introduction to seven key product management metrics and KPIs to add to your analytical toolbox. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;7 metrics to add to your analytical toolbox
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Net Promoter Score (NPS)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Quantifying customers’ happiness with your product is a multifaceted undertaking. One of the simplest ways to do this is my measuring your Net Promoter Score (NPS), which is based on a single question: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;How likely are you to recommend this service/product to a friend/colleague? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customers answer on a scale of one to 10, where one through six are deemed “detractors,” six through eight are categorized as “passives,” and nine and 10 are considered “promoters.” Then, your NPS is determined by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. Generally, a healthy NPS score is considered to be anything above zero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, once you know your NPS score, what should you do with it? For one, your promoters are an invaluable asset. Not only are they likely to promote your product via word-of-mouth, their positive feelings can also be leveraged through marketing efforts like case studies and interviews. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, PMs can (and should) use your NPS data to track down the source of your detractors’ frustrations, and turn dissatisfied customers into happier ones. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Feature Adoption &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you launch a new feature in your product, the obvious goal is for your customers to start leveraging it as soon as possible. There are several angles from which product managers can measure feature adoption, including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time to adopt&lt;/b&gt;, or how long it takes customer to begin using a feature after learning about it, which can show how well the feature addresses a pain point&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breadth of adoption&lt;/b&gt;, or what percentage of your users adopt the feature, which can tell you how appealing it is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Depth of adoption&lt;/b&gt;, or how often key user types engage with the feature and if they’re using it as intended, which can demonstrate how relevant the feature is and how easy or difficult it is to use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Duration of adoption&lt;/b&gt;, or how long a customer continues to use the feature after learning about it, which can tell you whether the feature is actually valuable to your users &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For SaaS companies, a baseline measure feature adoption is relative to monthly logins: Monthly Feature Adoption Rate (%) = [feature MAU / monthly logins] * 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order for your users to adopt new features, they need to be aware of them. There are several ways to communicate with your users about releases and updates, like through email newsletters, feature spotlight blog posts, social media announcements, and in-app notifications and/or walkthroughs. If a new feature is more complex or requires training to get the full value, consider hosting live or on-demand training webinars that users can tune in to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of course, feature adoption isn’t only a concern for new features. There are many strategies product managers can employ to boost adoption for existing features that might be under-used or have recently been updated, including running experiments, retooling your onboarding experience, and gathering user feedback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Retention rate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Retention rate is an especially vital metric for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-maturity-for-saas&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;SaaS and subscription-based businesses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the percentage of active users versus total users over time. For more in-depth retention breakdown, HubSpot offers a free downloadable &lt;a href=&quot;https://offers.hubspot.com/customer-service-metrics?hubs_post-cta=body&amp;amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com%2Fservice%2Fcustomer-retention-metrics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer service metrics calculator&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Much like its converse churn rate, retention rate goes beyond just marketing. Customers have bought the pitch. Keeping their monthly/yearly loyalty is a matter of meeting expectations, delivering continuous value and giving them reasons to stay. Improving retention is a deep, large, and wide challenge involving every customer touchpoint, from product to performance to customer service. For ideas and inspiration, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketingcharts.com/brand-related/brand-loyalty-115053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;2020’s top brands by customer loyalty&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One specific strategy for boosting retention is through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/07/01/seven-ways-to-make-your-subscription-loyalty-program-irresistible/?sh=5fab2bb15a04&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;loyalty program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Many companies extend perks and incentives to reward and engage current customers to recommend products and membership to others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;4. Customers lost/churn rate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Like retention rate, churn rate is relatively easy to grasp and often complex to improve. It’s the percentage of customers that leave over a given time period. Simple enough. However defining the time period to measure, even defining what constitutes a customer, varies almost as much as the companies using the metric. The guiding principle, as with any calculation is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.profitwell.com/customer-churn/calculate-churn-rate&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;keep it simple&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reducing churn, as with increasing retention, is a multifaceted objective. It’s of little surprise that attrition rates are highest among new customers and especially trial customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5. Customer satisfaction (CSAT)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer satisfaction, or CSAT, might seem a bit vague in concept, but nonetheless is vital &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2014/08/the-value-of-customer-experience-quantified&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;to quantify&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for players in highly competitive segments. Whatever the particular calculation, the prime driver of CSAT is meeting customer expectations. And they have many. From ordering/signup to delivery/access to performance to support, keeping customers happy means firing on all cylinders, every time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The complexity of determining customer satisfaction begins with determining what “satisfied” means for your business. The term is commonly defined by lack of frustration–as in, customers won’t leave if they don’t have a reason to. However, more-insightful qualitative data can reveal deeper understanding of users’ desires and how well they’re being met. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There used to be only one way to find out how customers really feel–to ask them. Now with tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, not only can you uncover customers’ feelings without conducting lengthy interviews, you can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/session-replay-elevates-qualitative-analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;quantify their sentiments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with data and analytics. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Conversion Rate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversion rate is a basic metric that can have any number of different meanings, even within a single company. Simply put, a conversion rate is the percentage of users who take a desired action or set of actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For SaaS companies, conversions often refer to the rates at which people move through your sales/marketing funnel. This might look something like: &lt;i&gt;number of people who are targeted by a demand generation campaign → % of those people who visit your site → % of visitors who start a free trial → % of free trialers who upgrade to a paid plan. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For product managers, conversion rates signal how successful your product strategy is, and how well your marketing and demand generation campaigns align with that product strategy. Low conversion rates might be tellers that you’re missing the mark somewhere within these strategies. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Stickiness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No other metric is as performance-driven at stickiness. Are people actually using your product, and how regularly? For SaaS and tech providers, whose products are designed for daily and weekly use, stickiness gives a clear view of adoption. This metric is calculated as daily active users (DAU), weekly active users (WAU) and/or monthly active users (MAU) versus total number of subscribers/downloaders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Stickiness trends are prime indicators of both churn and retention rates, and any spikes are certainly cause to track down the source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Just as no single food guarantees physical health, no single metric, nor collection of metrics, guarantees product success. The importance of all indicators, including the ones listed above, depends upon organization and circumstance. But identifying and relying on the most relevant metrics provides the best-informed guide to achieving it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[3 traits of DXI-ready companies]]></title><description><![CDATA[What are the components of a company that’s ready to accelerate digital experience?

(As revealed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-state-of-digital-shopping-2021/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a recent survey report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—maybe even more than a physical experience.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A customer’s ability to navigate your website or mobile app to find what they need is essential, and companies that get this right are quickly excelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That fact may seem obvious, but is worth reaffirming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s not obvious, however, is what happens behind the scenes that results in effective, powerful, and profit-driving websites and mobile apps. Which leads to the question: What’s the hold up? If it’s widely agreed upon that impressive digital experiences are vital to growth, why aren’t they the expectation, not the outlier? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The truth is that not all organizations have the right internal mechanisms to make digital experience improvements really adhere to organizational processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep reading to learn the three characteristics of companies that are truly ready to accelerate the digital experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Making Digital Experience Intelligence stick&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we get the chance to work with some of the leading companies in the world who focus on improving digital experience for their customers. And I’ve noticed some commonalities between companies who thrive with digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;In sum, those who are truly breaking new ground are organized to make decisions differently based on facts that matter to their success.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Leading companies are not only able to keep up with changing consumer demands but also to shape expectations—as compared to traditional, siloed organizations who benchmark success with outdated KPIs and make decisions at a glacial pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Does your company have the right characteristics to make DXI work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Organization: Cross-functional teams are essential&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many large organizations today are still structured as they have been for decades—where IT, UX, and revenue departments may as well be on separate planets. Each team’s executives might understand how their work progresses the company’s goals, but individual contributors are likely to feel that their daily tasks are disconnected from those metrics that really matter to company growth. When priorities aren’t challenged, company growth stagnates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The opposite of that traditional model is companies who excel with Digital Experience Intelligence tools. When product, design, engineering, UX, data, analytics, and other functions can access and look at the same dashboards, goals and metrics are clear and up-to-the-second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For instance, impressive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/session-replay-elevates-qualitative-analytics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;dashboard functionality&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; curates the relevant information that your team is looking for into an at-a-glance update alongside deeper insight. Rather than each team performing their own calculations and analyses, FullStory can bring all relevant DX data together to create a single source-of-truth for cross-functional teams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Decision-making: Driven by customers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data-driven decision-making is critical to business success. However, there is one major drawback to be wary of: data can be manipulated to say just about anything someone wants it to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And—especially for a large single-function team—what feels like your north star could be leading you further astray from decisions that drive growth for your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, when teams base decisions on what the &lt;i&gt;customer data&lt;/i&gt; is telling them, they can solve the data-deluge paradox— and the ability to do that is a sign that your team is ready for DXI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Asking simple questions of DXI data can yield incredible results: Where are our customers frustrated? Where are they confused? Where is our site not working as designed? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With DXI, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;empathy and data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; go hand in hand to improve customers’ experience, ensure purchases today, and build long-term brand loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Metrics: Emphasis on what’s effective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s the oldest trope in business: “You can’t manage what you don’t measure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Which is a nice idiom on its face, but falls apart when you consider that &lt;i&gt;you can’t realistically measure everything&lt;/i&gt;. Nor is every measurement worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The third essential trait of a company that’s ready for DXI is being laser focused on the metrics that matter most to company objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Even cross-functional teams that are focused on customer needs can get lost in the weeds when they are unsure what they are tracking and why. Looking for errors and exception messages or shaving time off performance may or may not matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What matters? Put bluntly, the money trail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Imagine being a product manager at an ecommerce company, and you’re giving a talk about shopping cart conversion rate to an executive. Here are two things you could say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After changing our checkout flow, our conversion rate is down 2%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve failed to convert $5 million in transactions since changing our checkout flow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The second option would be much more likely to catch executives’ attention. And, it can help you get the buy-in and resources to make necessary changes happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you’re already making a case for substantive changes on your website or mobile app using impactful data, DXI offers the next level of qualitative data to back up and accelerate your claim. &lt;/b&gt;One example of how companies emphasize critical metrics is by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051147573-Conversions-Revenue-Opportunities&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Revenue events&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within FullStory, which helps teams prioritize their efforts by revealing lost conversions associated with an issue and potential revenue gain from addressing the issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Anyone can make digital experience change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Regardless of your level, seniority, or role in an organization, you can make a positive difference in your customers’ experience and your company’s long-term revenue with your digital properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re sizing up digital experience at your organization, download our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/dxi-buyers-guide/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DXI buyer’s guide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who&lt;/b&gt; you work with and consult—are they all clustered within one function or diversified across technology, business, and analytics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How&lt;/b&gt; you’re making decisions—are decisions based on data for data’s sake, or driven by objective quantification of the customers’ experience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What&lt;/b&gt; you’re basing decisions on—is it a metric with no clear connection to your company’s core strategy, or is it explicitly tied to company revenue and growth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Putting these elements together will drive meaningful change in your customers’ journeys and their likelihood to return, with payoffs that go beyond today’s revenue and into tomorrow’s growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Interviewing product designers?

For tech companies, in particular, the competition to attract and retain talent is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-07-31/employers-bow-down-to-tech-workers-in-hottest-job-market&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fiercest it has been in decades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;more transactions being conducted digitally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, many savvy companies are hiring product and UX designers to help build better digital experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This means that product designers are in high demand, and they have plenty of options. For those doing the hiring, ensuring long-term employee satisfaction and retention starts with choosing the designer who’s the best fit for the job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are eight product designer interview questions to ask to gain a meaningful understanding of your candidates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. What’s an example of a user experience that you think is broken? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A passionate product designer shouldn’t need to hem and haw over this one—if they love user experience, they’ll have an answer at the ready. Have them critique the experience from multiple angles, and then ask them to speculate on how it ended up that way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Can you give an example of something recent that inspired you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is essentially the opposite of the above question, and gives the candidate the opportunity to talk about a user experience—or a single element of one—that they find excellent. You can follow up by asking them if and how they took that inspiration back to a project they were working on. Asking candidates to “provide an example of a time when…” is also a great way to gauge their introspection and willingness to talk about when things &lt;i&gt;didn’t&lt;/i&gt; go right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. What type of work or project do you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; not &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;enjoy doing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Talking about what you like to do is easy when you’re interviewing. Talking about things you’d rather not do (while remaining professional)? Well, that’s trickier. Candidates don’t want to seem lazy or overly particular, but it can be telling to hear how someone talks about work that’s less-than-thrilling. It’s unlikely that the outcome of the interview will hinge on this response, but understanding what types of projects a candidate &lt;i&gt;isn’t&lt;/i&gt; interested in helps you assess how they might fit into your team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. How do you know when you’ve gotten a design right? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Answering this question gives the candidate an opportunity to demonstrate how they analyze and measure user experiences—whether newly launched or on an ongoing basis. Not having an answer to this question is likely a bad sign, as it points to the practice of launching product experiences and never checking in on how they’re being used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, this allows the candidate to mention the tools and softwares they use to measure and monitor their designs. This is a good place for you to dig deeper into what kinds of metrics they typically look for and leads you into the next question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Describe a time when you’ve used data to solve a problem. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The ability to demonstrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;data-driven decision making&lt;/a&gt; is important in any role, but especially product design. Ideally, this question will lead the candidate to talk about a time when they noticed some type of user friction and then proposed a change to make the experience smoother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, a product designer who uses FullStory might see in their Dashboard that an element on the login page is causing a frustrating user experience. The designer can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-to-convince-your-product-manager-that-a-bug-needs-to-get-fixed/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;build a case that this issue should be fixed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by combining the qualitative data of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;Session Replay&lt;/a&gt; to provoke user empathy with metrics that quantify how many users are having this frustrating experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. How have you worked closely with software engineers?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Understanding how a candidate views &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/engaging-engineers-in-the-design-process/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;cross-team collaboration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is important both from efficiency and cultural standpoints. You can dive deeper into this question by asking them to describe a time when they pushed on engineering constraints to get something done, and conversely, an example of a time when they had to relinquish something they cared about. This helps you understand how the candidate approaches and navigates tradeoffs in the design process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Read about how engineering teams can leverage Digital Experience Intelligence in &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/engineers-guide-dxi/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;this guide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Have them walk you through a key project in their portfolio. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And ask “why” about &lt;i&gt;everything. &lt;/i&gt;Asking a candidate to explain why they made every small decision on a project lets you see inside their mind. Were their choices based on data, experience, or gut? Why did the project exist in the first place? What made it important to the business? How did it impact the users? Why did they choose to walk through this project in particular? What lessons did they learn or what would they have done differently? The amount of insight you can gain from this exercise is endless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. What’s your dream tech stack?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every product designer has a different set of tools they like to use, from project management tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/capture-bugs-like-fireflies-in-a-jar-with-fullstory-for-jira/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;JIRA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to user survey tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dx-and-xm-insights-with-fullstory-and-qualtrics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But asking your candidate the components of their tech stack can demonstrate their interest in—and capabilities of—pushing the boundaries of their role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Enter Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) platforms such as FullStory. When product designers are familiar or comfortable with using Session Replay as a way of gathering qualitative and quantitative information about real-life users to improve their work, it’s a major force multiplier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;P.S. If you’re interviewing to be a product designer at FullStory, don’t get &lt;/i&gt;too &lt;i&gt;excited at having found this—it’s only a tiny peek behind the curtain. That said, thanks so much for your interest! We look forward to talking with you soon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[5 key mobile app trends for 2021 ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here are 5 key mobile trends to keep in mind as we head into 2021, brought to you by the team at leading mobile app agency, Yodel Mobile.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/mobile-app-trends</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/mobile-app-trends</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[FullStory]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;This post was updated in July 2021.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article Summary: &lt;/b&gt;Here are five key mobile trends to keep in mind as we head into 2021, brought to you by the team at leading mobile app agency, Yodel Mobile. From an accelerated shift to a mobile-first lifestyle, to calls for more data transparency, make sure you know what to expect from mobile users in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For business leaders, trying to predict what a new year will bring is always a challenge–and 2021 holds even more uncertainty than usual. The past year, we’ve seen many unexpected trends emerge, we’ve seen companies and consumers defy all expectations, and we’ve seen every element of our daily life and work transform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As organizations continue to navigate new obstacles and attempt to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/deliver-value-now-boost-customer-loyalty&quot;&gt;mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, careful planning will be crucial to build stability and minimize uncertainties. In order to plan ahead successfully, businesses need to understand both:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the mobile market is evolving &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How consumer lifestyles are shifting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To that end, we’ve assembled a list of the top five mobile trends that mobile app designers and marketers can expect to see in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. An accelerated shift to a mobile-first lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With global restrictions on travel, entertainment, and work, people are increasingly turning to mobile as a channel to complete core tasks efficiently. Your customers are now using mobile apps to learn, shop, network, and even exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The shift to mobile-first has been occurring for several years, but the pandemic exaggerated the speed of this trend in 2020. This dramatic leap forward will likely cause a notable increase in the number of available mobile apps, leading to an increasingly saturated app marketplace. App companies that want to stand out among competitors need to implement an end-to-end marketing strategy that increases app discoverability, user acquisition, and, most importantly, user engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Unpredictable spikes and trends across app stores&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As people continue to adapt in 2021, app marketers should expect the unexpected when it comes to new trends and spikes across the app stores. You should make sure that your app is ready for potential sudden influxes of users and can mitigate increased drop offs, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If there is a rise in users looking for apps in your category, you need to have a proactive plan to  ensure that your app is visible on the app stores to avoid missed opportunities. Achieving this means placing a continuous focus on keyword optimization and app store optimization (ASO) to ensure that your app ranks for as many key search terms as possible. Below is a great example from &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.gymshark.com/pages/the-gymshark-conditioning-app&quot;&gt;Gymshark: &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You should also focus on ensuring that your user journey is seamless; a lack of clarity, complex onboarding processes or existing pain points can cause increases in user drop offs that you can’t afford in a saturated marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. The importance of mobile UI/UX optimization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With an increased dependence on mobile and rising consumer expectations for what mobile should provide, it’s critical that your app has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://yodelmobile.com/seamless-user-journey/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;engaging, easy-to-use user journey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To start, a concise, friendly onboarding process can significantly limit user drop off. New users are unlikely to understand the full value of your app, and will be quick to delete your app if they feel you’re asking for too much intrusive information up front. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many companies highlight the value of their app with a quick walk-through for new users &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; by offering limited access before requiring users to sign up. With increased competition in the marketplace, it’s important to build relationships with your users by providing them with a mobile experience that is not just informative, but also interactive, intuitive, and delightful.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myfitnesspal.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.myfitnesspal.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; does an excellent job of engaging the user, allowing them to get a feel for the app and all of its key features before they sign up for a free trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It is also important to understand which channels your customers are using. If you have a mobile web presence for instance, you should consider directing users from mobile web to your app—where conversion rates are &lt;a href=&quot;https://jmango360.com/wiki-pages-trends/mobile-app-vs-mobile-website-statistics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;over three times higher&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One way to do this is via &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/PromotingAppswithAppBanners/PromotingAppswithAppBanners.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;smart banners&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on your website. A smart banner will automatically determine whether the app is supported on the user’s device. If so, it will direct the user to either the app store listing or to the app if the user already has it on their device. With proper tracking, these banners can provide valuable information as to how many app users came from mobile web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. The bid for an increasingly data-transparent future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With increasing consumer awareness and concerns around data usage, there has been a significant shift among big tech companies to be more transparent about user data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One significant upcoming change is Apple’s depreciation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://yodelmobile.com/idfa-opt-in-app-marketing/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Once introduced, app users will have to opt-in to the IDFA. This means mobile apps will have to request permission to track unique user or device data, in particular device advertising identifiers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many third-party tools, such as attribution and analytics platforms, rely on IDFA as their primary method of collecting data; because of this, there will be a significant push to diversify the ways in which data is collected ahead of its depreciation. It is worth noting that some third-party solutions, such as FullStory, already have a privacy-centric model in place, which negates the effects that many other platforms are currently facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are of course other ways of collecting data that fall in line with Apple’s new regulations as well as increasing privacy regulations from governments. This includes being more dependent on probabilistic attribution models—using historical data to determine the probability that an install was driven by one or more campaigns—as well as using predictive power to curate in-app experiences. By widening the net when it comes to the data you choose to track, you can still learn a lot about your users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You may also have to re-evaluate the growth metrics you track. Whereas before many mobile apps were reliant on metrics that required device identification, such as Cost Per Install, testing out more advanced metrics, such as Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) or Lifetime Value (LTV), may be key to using less precise data to build out a more comprehensive picture of your users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Using consumer-centric marketing to build user loyalty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to truly engage your customers, you must humanize the relationship. Users are more likely to react positively to humor and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-incorporate-empathy-into-customer-messaging-9f5f937eb50f&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;empathetic messaging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (especially during times of crisis!), so it’s important to consider incorporating this throughout the full user journey. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jamesmaytheorytest.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jamesmaytheorytest.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;My Theory Test by James May&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an app that provides users with a fun and engaging alternative to existing theory test apps. James May, well-known for being one of the presenters on the UK TV series Top Gear, is the face of the app and his humor is incorporated into the videos, lessons and training plans—all intended to provide users with a more engaging way of passing their theory test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another popular approach is to get personal with users. Customized push notifications that include a user’s name and are specific to their preferences (e.g. based on their search history) can go a long way to improve open rates and drive engagement with your app. Thoughtfully tailored marketing across all channels will help you to build long-lasting relationships with your users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Planning ahead for mobile app success in 2021 &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To drive long-term app engagement and remain competitive in an increasingly crowded app marketplace, your company needs to implement a holistic app marketing plan. A successful approach blends organic and paid growth strategies to maximise app discoverability, user acquisition and, most importantly, retention of high-value, loyal users. Proactive planning and testing–and staying on top of mobile trends–are the keys to implementing an effective app marketing plan that drives larger business goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To learn more about app marketing and mobile trends, you can read our blog post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://yodelmobile.com/app-launch-series-understanding-mobile-market/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;understanding the app marketplace&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or watch our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzbNs5Sf_YEISZ1FkY4KfLQ&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mastering Mobile Marketing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; video series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;About Yodel Mobile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://yodelmobile.com/?utm_source=directory&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Businessofapps&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yodel Mobile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the leading app growth consultancy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://yodelmobile.com/yodel-mobile-named-mobile-agency-of-the-year/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mobile Agency of the Year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, specialising in launching and scaling apps.

Each quarter, we set lofty goals to generate demand, close deals, engage customers, and release new features and product improvements. On top of all that strategic OKR work, we also have to keep up with the “business as usual” work–the stuff we do day-to-day that keeps this place humming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But for one week, at the start of each quarter, we intentionally take a step back. We affectionately call this “Listening &amp;amp; Alignment Week,” and it’s an opportunity to reflect on where we’ve been, re-anchor around where we’re headed, and restore our energy. It’s a time to reconnect with each other and with our mission as a company. This week is also a chance to pause and reward ourselves for a successful quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But Listening &amp;amp; Alignment Week had an especially important purpose this time around–it marked the beginning of the second half of our fiscal year, and what a doozy the first half was! With a global pandemic, civil unrest across the United States, and a heated election season, things just kind of felt sideways in the world. At FullStory we are still running hard and our company continues to thrive, but in the midst of external uncertainty and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-goes-remote/&quot;&gt;transition to 100% remote work&lt;/a&gt; internally, we felt a heightened need to press “reset” and take a week to ground ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This L&amp;amp;A Week “reset” meant embracing a completely remote culture and focusing on taking a step out of the day-to-day. Our series of internal micro-talks centered around reminding people of our mission, sharing progress on big projects, giving opportunity for professional development, and bringing people back together for some community time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It was like a mini-conference, really. Here are some highlights from the many great things we had going on all week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We kicked the week off with our &lt;b&gt;Q3 OKR meeting&lt;/b&gt; like we always do–it gave us an opportunity to reflect on the past quarter and rally around what our goals and objectives are for the next three months. Throughout the week we anchored back on the vision and strategy of the company, and how we all play a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We had some fun reconnecting with one another with a &lt;b&gt;DERP&lt;/b&gt; (an old school FullStory term for Drop Everything for Recreational Play), and a &lt;b&gt;FS Voices&lt;/b&gt; session where we heard about one FullStorian’s experience living through Hurricane Katrina and another’s motorcycle adventure across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We also wanted to take this opportunity to grow our social awareness through &lt;b&gt;Allies Training&lt;/b&gt; sessions, where we learned how to develop our ally skills in everyday interactions, in-the-moment interventions, and ongoing advocacy. FullStorians also had the chance to learn best practices on slide building, writing, and management from coworkers in educational sessions throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We even brought in some outside guests. The &lt;b&gt;Meet the Customer&lt;/b&gt; session gave us an opportunity to see how FullStory is being used “in the wild” and ask questions directly to real users, while our &lt;b&gt;Fireside Chat&lt;/b&gt; with an investor offered a glimpse of what makes FullStory stand out in the world of venture-backed businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall, we learned some things and had some fun, too. We saw that even as the world evolves, and we evolve to meet its demands, we are still able to stay true to our core values of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics/&quot;&gt;empathy, clarity, and bionics&lt;/a&gt;. Most importantly, it felt really good to hit that reset button and realign ourselves around the mission, vision, work, product, and community that make FullStory so special.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Finance and insurance: 9 proven tips to build better digital experiences ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Even for must-do tasks like managing finances and insurance online, customers will walk away from a poor digital experience. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/finance-insurance-digital-experience-maturity</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/finance-insurance-digital-experience-maturity</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Madison Eubanks]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2021 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article summary: &lt;/b&gt;In this post, we outline nine research-backed ways finance and insurance companies can create a digital experience that meets customers&amp;#x27; needs and expectations. All data presented here is from FullStory&amp;#x27;s original research, &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;The State of Digital Experience 2020: Mapping a Path to Digital Experience Maturity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital transformation, Net Promoter Score (NPS), CSAT, and Voice of customer are topics that are top-of-mind for insurance carriers and finserve companies working to perfect their digital experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As is the case with nearly all industries in the digital age, insurance and finserve companies are using the digital customer experience as a key differentiator, a way to attract new customers, and a means for retaining (and delighting) existing ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For insurance and finserve organizations, a digital experience analytics platform like FullStory can answer questions like: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How are prospective policy holders using our public pages? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How well are our portal registration programs operating? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How are process flows such as bill payment, claim submission and quoting performing? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are investments and enhancements to web and mobile properties being valued/used by policyholders, prospective policyholders, customers, etc?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are errors, dead clicks and performance issues impacting digital experience? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are active daily users trending upward, downward, or staying the same? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the most common user journeys? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
FullStory is engineered to answer these questions and more for finserve and insurance organizations. More importantly, FullStory provides a framework to support continual improvement and to ensure your investments in a better experience are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;grounded in data, not guesswork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In an original research report we released last year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The State of Digital Experience Maturity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, data showed that DX maturity can be measured across four key categories: &lt;b&gt;Alignment, Technology, Outcomes, and Mindset (ATOM). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, what actions can financial service and insurance DX pros take to achieve greater digital experience maturity? Below, we outline nine research-backed guidelines and focus areas that span those four key categories to help you drive long-term DX success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Digital experience success should have an executive owner &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While DX efforts are likely to be spread over multiple teams and/or departments, the executive owner is the person responsible for ensuring that everyone involved in the digital experience is aligned on the overarching goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data shows that organizations with a more mature DX are 93 percent more likely to report that “everyone working on the digital experience understands the organization’s goals and how to achieve them.” This implies that having an executive owner to educate, delegate, and measure the organization’s digital experience efforts is one key to DX success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Cross-functional team structures enable DX improvement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is a cross-functional team? Essentially, it’s a team built of people who have different job functions and areas of expertise, who can come together and use their collective know-how to achieve certain goals. A team structured in this way can lead to improved decision-making, creative problem-solving, and a de-siloing of relevant information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are four tips for building effective cross-functional teams: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set clear goals for each team.&lt;/b&gt; Goals should be aligned with the organizations’ overall digital experience objectives. For a cross-functional team, clearly defined, common goals are a critical unifying factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make sure cross-functional teams are plugged into key stakeholders.&lt;/b&gt; Stakeholders in DX success–like an executive owner–need to be bought into each cross-functional team’s mission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anticipate team conflict and pave a path for conflict resolution.&lt;/b&gt; By definition, cross-functional teams group together people with various levels of influence and expertise. In order to be effective, each member must feel able to contribute equally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make sure each team is set up for success.&lt;/b&gt; Teams should have both the authority, accountability and resources to accomplish the mission at hand. 


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Democratized information facilitates employee autonomy and quick decision-making&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To democratize information and combat data silos, some organizations turn to data visualization platforms that allow individuals to have near complete access to relevant customer data that enables them to do their jobs efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the onset of widespread remote work, it’s more crucial than ever for organizations to focus on reducing the impact of disconnected teams, breaking down existing data silos, and preventing future ones from arising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Highly integrated technologies diminish the impact of disconnected teams and prevent data silos &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When choosing technologies for your organization, one of the first decisions to make is whether to use a technology suite or to build a stack. There are, of course, pros and cons to each. However, depending on the size of your organization, it often makes sense to create a technology stack that can meet your teams’ more nuanced needs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When researching and building a tech stack, ensure that your technologies have: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robust APIs that empower developers to enrich their tech stack with platform data and deepen the insights they receive within the platform itself &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webhooks to power workflows across the business and allow you to set up automations and take action in real time &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ecosystem of integrations that allows you to connect your tech stack and create a shared language around digital experience across your business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is an opportunity to source technologies that proactively point you toward actionable insights and automatically surface your most important opportunities for improvement, according to potential business impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Building a fully integrated digital experience tech stack with FullStory has been a game changer for us. With Optimizely we’re able to run experiments on our own digital experience, use Amplitude to analyze results quantitatively, and with both connected to FullStory we can easily analyze the underlying customer experience and find the best opportunities for improvement.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Matt Stein, VP of Product Design, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/session-replay-helps-metromile-grow-revenue&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Metromile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Technologies should provide a complete view of your customers’ digital experience &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having a vivid picture of your organization’s digital customer experience allows you to understand which parts of your DX do and don’t work, and guides decisions around how to prioritize improvements and fixes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do you put together that clear, complete picture? You need two important capabilities: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1) complete, unsampled data ingestion, and 2) quantitative and qualitative data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first part–complete, unsampled data ingestion–hinges on instrumentation and the ability to retain large amounts of data. There are two main ways to do this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a traditional product analytics tool, which requires you to manually tag any element that you want to monitor in order to report on it later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, with a digital experience platform, like FullStory, that leverages instrumentation-free analytics. These will capture and index every user interaction on your site or app from the moment you install the JavaScript snippet, and require no manual tagging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The second piece of the puzzle–&lt;a href=&quot;http://v&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;collecting quantitative &lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt; qualitative data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–gives you the ability to understand both &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; users are doing on your site or app and &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; they’re doing it. An effective tech stack will proactively surface where issues lie in the customer journey, the scale of those issues, and what’s causing them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Prioritize customer empathy to understand the “why” behind customer behavior&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Offering a better digital experience means developing an organization-wide mindset that truly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/use-empathy-to-build-better-products&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;values customer empathy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and seeks to understand the customer journey. And customers who are visiting a finance or insurance company’s site or app are more likely to be in a high-stress situation–making your team members’ empathy skills even more critical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are many ways to train this muscle including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking directly with customers, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;observing customers using your product,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;reading customer reviews and feedback, and/or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;collecting survey responses, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The closer individuals at your organization can get to the customer experience, the more easily they’ll be able to empathize with customers’ struggles and needs. This is an area where a platform that offers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can come in handy–and save time. Watching real users navigate (or struggle to navigate) your site or app is a great way for non-customer facing team members to see and empathize with how users are feeling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Adopt and nurture a test-and-learn culture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to our research, companies that deliver better digital experiences more often are more likely to encourage testing and learning than their less mature counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;An effective test-and-learn culture empowers individuals at your organization to share and learn from both successes &lt;i&gt;and “&lt;/i&gt;failures” in their work. Giving team members the opportunity to test data-driven ideas and learn from their wins and inevitable losses fosters an innovative environment–where great ideas are born and shared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some key components of a test-and-learn culture include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone checks their ego at the door&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test ideas are backed by evidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transparency: You share your wins and “losses”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Develop a system for prioritizing digital fixes and improvements. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By this point you know that a poor digital experience can have enormous consequences for your business. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/63794/40-of-brits-abandon-bank-onboarding-process&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;40 percent of customers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; say they will abandon the process of creating a bank account if the process takes too long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Identifying such issues is one thing, but knowing their business impact is an entirely different story. At FullStory, one of the key complaints we hear from product leaders at ecomm and SaaS companies is: We have a lot of data, but we struggle to find clear, actionable insights and a way to prioritize them.

The key is to implement a tool that can help assign revenue values to specific elements of your DX. For example,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/user-experience-issues-by-revenue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory Revenue Opportunities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;–a feature of our Conversions function–let you assign actual dollar amounts to elements of the user experience, creating a highly quantifiable way to determine which improvements to focus on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conversions immediately helped us pinpoint friction in our funnel. With FullStory, we were able to easily identify improvement opportunities, validate our findings with Session Replay, and update it quickly. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Christiaan Johnson, Director of Product Design, Finicity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Optimize the digital experience for key conversions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you think about your organization’s ability to optimize for key conversions and increase revenue, you should consider the success of your digital experimentation program. Running strategic digital experiments at a high volume is proven to generate positive results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Research from Optimizely shows that organizations that run a high volume of experiments—21 or more per month—drive a 14% increase in revenue. Compare this to organizations running fewer than 20 tests per month, driving 1 to 4% increases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/5-tips-experimentation-strategy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;high-level strategies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for evaluating and adjusting your digital experimentation program: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refresh your customer research regularly, using both quantitative and qualitative methods to make sure you are addressing their most important needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track current product demand, and identify and validate emerging product opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make calculated investments where you can: Hire the best talent, acquire traffic, invest in technology to power your digitization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmark your digital tech maturity, audit your existing toolset, evaluate alternatives and then consider negotiating better rates or changing to a provider that allows you to modernize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FullStory helps your organization raise the bar on digital experience maturity. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Request a demo today.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Structured Wrongness with the Suck Less Cycle]]></title><description><![CDATA[Software development is so malleable, it's easy for teams to slide into the chaos of possibility.

It’s sooo easy to add a little here and tweak a little there just because you feel like it. Or, in some companies, you might show up to work only to find an influential executive has had a visionary shower-thought they&amp;#x27;re convinced will be a &amp;quot;game changer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software is so malleable that while it’s reasonable to say &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; is possible, it doesn’t follow that &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you&amp;#x27;re designing and developing while chasing a constantly moving target, it&amp;#x27;s hard to maintain a sufficient level of focus and directed momentum to truly finish arcs of work. Eventually, everyone&amp;#x27;s frustrated and wondering if you&amp;#x27;ve completely lost direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That’s the double-edged sword. Software is so malleable that while it’s reasonable to say &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; is possible, it doesn’t follow that &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You have to pick your battles and see them through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Loop Forever: Dogma→Product→Insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Recognizing that, like everyone else, we at FullStory are likely to fall into these predictable, dumb patterns, we saw a need for a conceptual framework that could mitigate those frustrating aspects of product development. What we wanted was a way of expressing our shared goal of evolving quickly but &lt;i&gt;avoid&lt;/i&gt; flailing–a structured approach that would keep us mind-melded and help us move cohesively as a team. And we needed a way of communicating expectations about each iteration of the creative process so no one would be surprised where we ended up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The concrete result of our abstract needs? A silly but evocative diagram. An approach to &lt;i&gt;structuring our wrongness&lt;/i&gt; so as to reliably reduce it over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We call it &lt;b&gt;The Suck Less Cycle&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Suck Less Cycle is an iterative loop. You can have short iterations or long ones, but the point is, this is a cycle you repeat forever. And if you’re doing it right, with each turn you get a little bit better, and suck a little bit less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 1: Dogma&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first and most important step is establishing the &lt;i&gt;Dogma&lt;/i&gt; about how you think you should proceed. &amp;quot;Dogma&amp;quot; was chosen intentionally because your assertions aren’t facts. They are hypotheses—sometimes just guesses—about how to operate so as to produce some desired future outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Critically, during any one iteration of the Cycle, everyone agrees to show deep and abiding reverence for the current Dogma as if it were revealed truth handed down by Lord Huron himself. Yes, deep down you’ll know that sometimes your Dogma includes wild-ass guesses as to the best way forward, but at least they’ll be well-articulated wild-ass guesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s an example set of tenets your team might decide to adopt as Dogma:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should build features A, B, C instead of features X, Y, Z.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should prioritize fixing bugs over adding new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our homepage should load in less than 100 milliseconds on a 10Mb cell network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;...any other tenet you choose that helps everyone proceed unambiguously...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each tenet helps &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; make decisions about what to work on when while setting clear expectations for everyone else on your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should we start developing marketing materials for feature Y? &lt;i&gt;No. &lt;/i&gt;For feature B? &lt;i&gt;Yes!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should we expect more bugs to be fixed and feature development to be slower?&lt;i&gt;Yes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our homepage takes 3 seconds to load on a smartphone. Is that bad? &lt;i&gt;Yes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;...and so on...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s typically easy to get buy-in from all the stakeholders for this sort of Dogma, at least for one iteration of the Suck Less Cycle, because it&amp;#x27;s just so...clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because Dogma is the solid foundation upon which the Suck Less Cycle is built, we&amp;#x27;ll return to it in even more depth below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 2: Product&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With clearly established Dogma–we like to say &amp;quot;we&amp;#x27;ve banged the gavel&amp;quot;–you now have conceptual cover to justify embarking on a substantial arc of work towards building &lt;b&gt;Product&lt;/b&gt;. You can act without the ground shifting beneath your feet. Since you’ve front-loaded the understanding of how you’ll proceed, you can move faster and more autonomously. You don’t have to “check in” all the time to see if anything has changed. It won’t have changed because it &lt;i&gt;can’t&lt;/i&gt; change! Why? Because &lt;i&gt;Dogma!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;(At least until the next iteration of the Cycle.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thus, you can make progress fearlessly, and eventually, launch your &lt;b&gt;Product&lt;/b&gt;. And now that you’ve got yourself a Product (or an update to an existing product) it&amp;#x27;s time for &lt;b&gt;Insight&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 3: Insight&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your new work is out there, so now you have the opportunity to support it and observe how it’s used. In other words, you’re gaining real-world evidence, which is the best way to pressure-test your &lt;b&gt;Dogma&lt;/b&gt;. Analysis follows, and with a little luck you’ll gain some insight that you can use to update your &lt;b&gt;Dogma&lt;/b&gt; for next time ‘round, either by reinforcing tenets that worked out well or changing prior assumptions based on evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Suck Less Cycle helps you relax about being wrong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;None of this is rocket science, so why even have this diagram? And why is it all about “sucking less?&amp;quot; Calling this loop “The Suck Less Cycle” helps everybody chill out about the fact that, yeah, we suck in a lot of ways. Acknowledge the imperfection. It&amp;#x27;s okay!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building great software is not about being perfect. It’s about reliably making progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of course&lt;/i&gt;, we all want everything to be perfect. And things could always be better, if only because the goalposts shift to an ever-more-exciting vision as a product evolves. We’re always falling short of our imagination. Embrace it! Accepting that you don&amp;#x27;t have to be once-and-for-all right, all the time, is liberating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s hard to be creative and effective when you’re anxious or fearful about failure. Being innovative usually &lt;i&gt;requires&lt;/i&gt; taking risks, and they don&amp;#x27;t always work out. Putting the sentiment right there in the title–WE SUCK!–removes the sting. It’s a self-seriousness pressure relief valve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Building great software is not about being perfect. It’s about reliably making progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dogma! You can’t change all the things all the time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re getting into the Suck Less Cycle, it&amp;#x27;s worth digging deeper on why the notion of Dogma is so critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The explicit presence of Dogma in the diagram is everyone&amp;#x27;s reminder that you can’t just change all the things all the time. Some guardrails simply must be set in stone for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Such constraints turbo-charge creativity by focusing invention toward clear goals, and your Dogma creates space for designers and developers to feel that they are able to truly solve a problem &lt;i&gt;well&lt;/i&gt;. Anything less than &lt;i&gt;well&lt;/i&gt; is bound to inhibit your potential insight, because nobody trusts the outcome. Anything less than &lt;i&gt;well&lt;/i&gt;, and you&amp;#x27;d be inclined to say, “We’re only getting bad results because we didn’t get a chance to &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; do what we planned before getting randomized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dogma breaks the above chicken-and-egg paradox, so that you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; trust the outcome, gain reliable insight, and learn institutional lessons about what works and what doesn&amp;#x27;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dogma? You can change next time ‘round, though&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But! Because it’s a &lt;i&gt;cycle&lt;/i&gt;, it’s explicit that, yeah, we &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; change our thinking—so long as it&amp;#x27;s the right time. Not midstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;E.g. “We’re doing X, you think we should do Y. That’s fine. I hear you. Next time we want to update our worldview, we’ll consider Y. And when we do, we’ll have evidence of how X worked or didn’t work. We can use what we learn from X when we consider new things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Importantly, Dogma is both an input and an output, and &lt;i&gt;it should change over time&lt;/i&gt;. How does Dogma change? At FullStory, we have a special kind of meeting we call a &amp;quot;Prove It&amp;quot; which we’ll talk more about in a future post.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having a Dogma in the fight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#x27;t know whether you were right or wrong, you can&amp;#x27;t improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The very act of &lt;i&gt;stating&lt;/i&gt; your Dogma–and making a habit of talking about Dogma as a first-class thing–is powerful because it forces you to communicate important concepts broadly that might otherwise go unstated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Write your Dogma down. Only by having recorded what you &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; would be true in the future can you know, later, whether you were right or wrong. If you can&amp;#x27;t know whether you were right or wrong, you can&amp;#x27;t improve. By contrast, if you never &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; take a position, you can’t really know how you should evolve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;May we all strive to suck less&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As simplistic as this framework may be, &lt;b&gt;The Suck Less Cycle&lt;/b&gt; has a clear effect on how our whole company operates at FullStory. Leveraging Dogma to effectively communicate and execute while accepting and embracing the reality of never-ending improvement, we get excited about the marathon, knowing that with each turn we know a little bit more and suck a little bit less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If this article triggers any thoughts, if you&amp;#x27;ve seen alternative approaches to solving the same problems, or if I can clarify anything about the Suck Less Cycle, let&amp;#x27;s discuss in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Perhaps with a dose of Dogma and a simple intent to &amp;quot;suck less&amp;quot; we can return a little health and sanity to software development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Prove-its: Make crisp decisions, move faster]]></title><description><![CDATA[How the 5 part Prove-Its system can help you make crisp, binding, company-wide decisions faster. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/make-better-decisions-faster</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/make-better-decisions-faster</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Bruce Johnson]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 Apr 2018 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How we bang the gavel on the path to building FullStory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“I think you guys are just wrong.

He was challenging a tenet of our dogma that had been in place since FullStory launched a couple of years prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Gio was a newbie, though. Was it okay for him to be outspoken? If so, and especially if he was right, how could he &lt;i&gt;actually achieve&lt;/i&gt; the change he was advocating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ll come back to Gio and how his crusade turned out, but to do that we have to talk first about the relationship between FullStory Dogma and Prove-Its.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dogma solvent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a related post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.fullstory.com/suck-less-cycle/&quot;&gt;The Suck Less Cycle&lt;/a&gt;, I talked over and over about “dogma” and how critical it is to be clear about the tenets that teams will use to add constructive constraints to make decisions and guide progress. Dogma is the cornerstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But how exactly do you make dogma a thing? How do you make it, you know,&lt;i&gt;official&lt;/i&gt;? And later on in the Suck Less Cycle, when you start to think some tenet might be wrong, how exactly do you change your dogma in a way that everyone can understand and accept?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Everyone at FullStory knows the answer to that: you call for a Prove-It.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is a Prove-It?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Prove-It is just a meeting. That may sound anticlimactic, but it’s a very special kind of meeting that everyone takes particularly seriously. The purpose of a Prove-It is to make a crisp, binding, company-wide decision about a specific proposition that is being advocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some examples of Prove-Its over the last year or so:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will adopt the “Voltron” Security Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will overhaul the FullStory onboarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will offer a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.fullstory.com/introducing-fullstory-free/&quot;&gt;free version of FullStory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will introduce &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.fullstory.com/continuity/&quot;&gt;Feature Packs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will interact with customers according to this new Smugging Playbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sounds weird, I know.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And, of course, there’s Gio’s Prove-It:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will allow people to sign up for FullStory using free email providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, while it’s a “just” a meeting, everyone knows that when they see a Prove-It on the company-wide FullStory calendar, it’s a big deal. A meeting not to be missed if you have any interest in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The anatomy of a Prove-It&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do you actually undertake a Prove-It? It’s meant to be very simple and not-at-all bureaucratic. And, despite the seriousness of how it may look when described clinically below, it actually feels quite friendly and lighthearted in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Prove-Its have 5 parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Proposition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Prove-It starts with a straightforward proposition–a single, clear sentence–stating what will become true if the Prove-It is approved. Getting this right is critical, because you want everyone to easily understand exactly what’s at stake. It’s also harder than you’d expect, because being starkly opinionated takes a lot of courage. And the clearer you are, the harder it is to dodge pointed critique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A weak, squishy proposition might sound like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s improve support availability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whereas a strong proposition will be unambiguous:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will begin offering dedicated chat support on X date.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s hard to miss what is being proposed in that second variant, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Advocates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You’ve got a proposition. Now who will actually make the case for it? You and fellow advocates. Typically one person leads the charge, but it’s really helpful to have multiple people who are willing to publicly promote the idea, too. The best advocates are people who can make the case in an objective way. Too much emotion tends to confuse the issue. Advocates should be prepared to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-highest-form-of-disagreement/531597/&quot;&gt;steel man&lt;/a&gt; the status quo even as they point out why their proposed change would be better still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Approvers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Prove-It must have an explicitly named set of approvers. These are the people whose unanimous, explicit agreement you need in order for something to be proved. The best slate of approvers should be those people who need to be fully bought-in so as to ensure the proposition is implemented successfully if approved. For example, when we have “This feature is ready to launch” Prove-Its, we always want to make sure trusted leaders from marketing and sales are approvers because they’re the ones who have to make sure they’re excited to talk to customers about what we’re proposing to launch. If they don’t understand a feature or don’t believe in its value, that’s bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We want approvers to give a public, explicit “Yes, I approved this and want to move forward.” It makes a big difference having them go on the record. For one thing, they pay a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; more attention to the presentation because their name will be attached. In addition, it sends a strong signal to their respective teams that the decision has been well-vetted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Who actually decides who the approvers are? While different companies may have different approaches, at FullStory, we founders reserve the right to specify the set of approvers who must be included for any Prove-It. However, the advocates can choose to include additional approvers if there are other people whose active buy-in they wish to galvanize. Interesingly, although it might sound as if picking approvers could be contentious, in practice it’s never been even the slightest problem for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Attendees&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, almost every Prove-It is completely open for anyone in the company to attend, and Prove-Its are published on our company-wide calendar. Openness is an important aspect of a Prove-It, so that even people who aren’t directly involved can at least see how decisions are made. Attendees will realize that they can contribute to the conversation if they want to. And, at a minimum, attendees will have no doubt that everything has been thought of, debated, and reasoned out. Even people who don’t choose to attend will have strong buy-in merely knowing that they could have attended if they had wanted to. Consequently, they’ll be more likely to accept whatever it is that’s been proved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Meeting and decision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The meeting itself should be as short as possible, typically an hour and almost never longer than 90 minutes. Keeping the meeting short puts constructive back-pressure on the advocates to have their case prepared in a succinct, digestible form. A slide deck is ideal. It can make the case, with all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;supporting data&lt;/a&gt; and arguments clearly articulated, is efficient and creates an artifact that you can keep around for the future so that new people (or forgetful future selves) can look back on the rationale for any of your current dogma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You end up with a crisp decision, which is always better than abiding ambivalence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the meeting, the advocates talk through the deck, clarifying any points that are confusing, and then hard questions and a discussion follow. When the end approaches, it becomes time for the approvers to make a decision. If it’s unanimous, the Prove It is adopted and change is ratified. If not, nothing changes. Based on the sentiment from the approvers, the advocates may choose to improve their case and try again later. Either way, you end up with a crisp decision, which is always better than abiding ambivalence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What happened with Gio’s “free email signups” Prove-It?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was something we had done one way for years, yet a brand new person to FullStory was able to change that part of our dogma in a single meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Circling back to Gio and the question of whether FullStory should allow non-business emails. Disallowing free email providers from use in our sign-up form had been our policy for a couple of years. Gio deeply disagreed with that so much that he put together a really thoughtful case. We all showed up, and he just blew us away with his reasoning, and in an hour, we changed our policy. This was something we had done one way for years, yet a brand new person to FullStory was able to change that part of our dogma in a single meeting. It’s cool that Prove Its make those sorts of changes possible. And it sends a message to everybody else that if you have an idea, it can really be heard, and it can really create change in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And that’s perhaps my favorite thing about Prove-Its: anybody can drive them. They’re agnostic to seniority. It’s the antidote for drinking too much of your own Kool-Aid. Everyone has a voice, reasoned arguments rule the day, and you should want it that way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Managing GDPR and FullStory Session Replay]]></title><description><![CDATA[GDPR soon goes into effect.

Now FullStory users with admin permissions can entirely &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828373&quot;&gt;erase users&lt;/a&gt; from their account at the click of a button (with confirmation, of course).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After a user is completely deleted, you’ll receive a discreet email, a receipt of sorts, to confirm that the appropriate action has been taken. We also offer an &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828373&quot;&gt;API endpoint for deleting users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Better exclusions and consent tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While we’ve always offered the ability to exclude any element from recording, we concluded the general feeling of our UI for element exclusions was slapdash. It was just a textarea to dump CSS selectors that left some users intimidated and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We also massively enhanced our excluded elements by allowing users to &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623254&quot;&gt;selectively record them based on user consent&lt;/a&gt;. Using the FS.consent API, you can now let FullStory know, with a little bit of code, whether or not to record any consent-sensitive parts of your webpages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep user IP addresses out of FullStory (if you want to)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For our users who consider IP addresses to be personally identifiable information, we now offer the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020622834&quot;&gt;ability to discard IP addresses&lt;/a&gt; from FullStory. We will hold the IP address while the session is cooking, but once it’s been served, ready to consume, the IP address will be in the virtual garbage can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The rigorous demands of GDPR may feel complicated, but FullStory’s foray of feature functionality should leave you feeling just fine. And while the future under GDPR may still be murky, we’re confident we have good options in place to keep our users satisfied and, as always, we’ll be open to trying new things when they’re right for us and our users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/gdpr-and-fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learn more about GDPR and FullStory.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[3 ways web performance is critical for digital customer experience]]></title><description><![CDATA[When it comes to customer experience online, web performance is a critical for driving brand love, loyalty, and your business's bottom line.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/cx-and-web-performance</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/cx-and-web-performance</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hanna Woodburn]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2018 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Build a brand worth fighting for: 3 ways web performance drives exceptional customer experiences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The forum on my neighborhood &lt;i&gt;Nextdoor app&lt;/i&gt; has recently been bursting with passionate commentary about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atlanta.curbed.com/2018/5/3/17315024/bird-scooters-atlanta-commute-last-mile-connectivity&quot;&gt;influx of Bird scooters in Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There is the expected hemming and hawing about Birds as a nuisance, clogging sidewalks and interrupting traffic flows. But, there is also an outpouring of Bird users extolling their value and—most importantly it seems—the fun of riding them. One lengthy post from our forum moderator states that Birds are popular because they are widely available, easy to use, fast, and make the rider feel like a kid again. Simply put, in his eyes, they deliver an exceptional experience for the rider. Good customer experiences build brands worth fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Good customer experiences build brands worth fighting for.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For electric scooters, retailers, SaaS apps, and everything in between, &lt;b&gt;availability&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;ease of use&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;speed&lt;/b&gt; are all critical drivers of customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Undergirding web performance in complementary yet distinct ways, these tenants create a mutually reinforcing relationship between CX and customer satisfaction online. In other words, it is impossible to focus on one and not the other—let&amp;#x27;s see how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Availability—&amp;quot;Yes, we’re open!&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Have you ever navigated to a website looking for a specific product, adding it to your cart, plugging in your payment info only to get an error message? Not fun. Generally speaking, you want your customers to be able to find and access the products they are looking for. Product availability is a driver of good CX. Sure, product scarcity can drive demand, especially around a hot release, but that isn’t a great customer experience. Availability matters to customers—it&amp;#x27;s a sign out front that reads, &amp;quot;Yes, we&amp;#x27;re open!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From a web performance perspective, availability is measured as uptime. The most basic of performance metrics, uptime answers the question “is this website up or down?” Frequent outages or periods of downtime frustrate users and harm brand perception. This is why companies use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/blog/statuspage/statuspage-examples-25-status-pages-showcasing-excellent-customization-design-incident-communication&quot;&gt;status pages&lt;/a&gt; to help create transparency around outages and work to rebuild trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While uptime may be the most pressing availability issue, it’s not the only one. What about those annoying 404 error pages (no matter how &lt;a href=&quot;https://uxplanet.org/10-great-examples-of-404-error-pages-6dff84eea87d&quot;&gt;cute or clever&lt;/a&gt; they may be)? Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/using-ref/frustration-signals&quot;&gt;dead links&lt;/a&gt;? Are your customers able to do the same things on mobile as on desktop? While not as worthy of panic bells, these errors and bugs impact availability, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Easy to use—no roadblocks ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No one likes to see their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/&quot;&gt;customers struggle on their website&lt;/a&gt;, even if it does create empathy. Websites and apps that are intuitive and easy-to-use are more likely to be adopted. While some companies leverage &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/an-open-bar-for-beta-testers&quot;&gt;inebriated users&lt;/a&gt; to find ease of use issues, we like to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/why-you-cant-do-a-user-interview-without-skin-in-the-game/&quot;&gt;FullStory for understanding usability&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ease of use matters for website performance, too. For instance, your complex website might render beautifully on a desktop monitor, but if it isn’t responsively designed, it could be clunky and cumbersome for customers on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s worthwhile both from a CX and a web performance standpoint to understand how many steps your users have to take to perform mission critical user flows. Are you making checkout processes too laborious? Can you simplify search?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Page speed—fast and furious&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of these three tenants, speed is the only most often associated with website performance. And for good reason. Website performance is primarily concerned with how long it takes for a user to see, access, or interact with your content. Good or bad performance is measured with metrics, such as time to first contentful paint, time to first interactive, page load time, and many, many more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But just because speed is the purview of web performance doesn&amp;#x27;t mean it isn’t also applicable to CX. It’s equally important to ensure that customers feel like their time is respected, which means setting expectations properly. This is done virtually by incorporating loading animation and in real life by enabling customers to track their purchase--be it pizza or pens--in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, 53% of mobile website visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load. How do your mission-critical pages stack up against this benchmark? Can you identify easy performance wins, such as unoptimized images or slow third party scripts you don’t rely on anymore?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;(You can use FullStory&amp;#x27;s Dev Tools to troubleshoot page speed plus other errors abd unoptimized perforance—&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/performance-issues-got-you-down-turn-on-new-dev-tools-in-fullstory/&quot;&gt;learn more&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A great digital experience requires great web performance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most users who have a bad experience with your website won’t tell you that they were frustrated—they’ll just leave. You’ve already spent money and resources to drive these potential customers to your website, and failing to capitalize on that investment because of poor performance is, simply put, bad for business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer experience and web performance are two birds that flock together, which is why if your site isn&amp;#x27;t available, easy to use, and fast, these birds won&amp;#x27;t fly. And like Bird scooters, perhaps making your website breezy, effortless, and ready when your customers need it most will leave your customers feeling like kids again.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Heatmaps for engagement on FullStory: Visualize user clicks online]]></title><description><![CDATA[FullStory now has Engagement Heatmaps: These colorful visualizations show you how aggregate users are interacting with your site or app.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/engagement-heatmaps-on-fullstory</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/engagement-heatmaps-on-fullstory</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jaime Yap]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We hear you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sometimes you&amp;#x27;re replaying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;session recordings&lt;/a&gt; in FullStory and feel too close to the action.

That is, problems like approximating [X, Y] positions, accounting for dynamic app states and page overlays, configuration, and the pesky challenge of “splotch” mapping. We covered these &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-are-web-heatmaps-how-do-they-work-pros-cons-alternatives/&quot;&gt;4 major problems of heatmaps&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite these challenges, heatmaps have a major advantage over Click Maps: heatmaps are a much faster way to contextualize aggregate user trends for a given page. They give you a useful impression. You can see what clicks—quick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And what heatmapping tools may lack when it comes to precision, they make up for in time to insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Engagement Heatmaps speed up &amp;quot;time to insight&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wait. &lt;i&gt;What’s time to insight?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory we’ve spent a lot of time thinking about analytics and insights. In particular, we think about the relationship between data relevance and time—something we call “time to insight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Time to insight is how long it takes to go from “Ah, hmm … 🤔” to “Aha! 😍” And at FullStory, it&amp;#x27;s a useful frame for assessing the value of a given feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A fast time to insight can make all the difference when it comes to taking decisive action quickly. How often do you receive incredible new knowledge when it’s no longer relevant? When it comes to insights about your tens of thousands or even millions of users, timing is everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engagement Heatmaps speed your time to insight&lt;/b&gt;. They make it fast and easy to shift from the ground-level perspective of a single user&amp;#x27;s interactions on a page to high-level insight about how lots of users engage with that same page. From the micro to the macro &lt;i&gt;fast.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, our Engagement Heatmaps can also show you engagement by our popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/&quot;&gt;frustration signals&lt;/a&gt;. You can go from your top-level Engagement Heatmap to one based on Rage Clicks, Dead Clicks, or Error Clicks.

&lt;/i&gt;🔧 &lt;i&gt;Are there easy ways to modify the product to improve the experience?
&lt;/i&gt;😖 &lt;i&gt;Why are customers losing interest and churning?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To answer these kinds of questions, you must understand motivation. What pulls people to act? What pushes them away? While each of us has a unique blend of desires and dreams—or fears and anxieties—we have much more in common because we&amp;#x27;re all human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That is, we&amp;#x27;re all working with similar organic &amp;quot;hardware,&amp;quot; and that hardware will work in common ways from person to person. Thanks to research on human behavior, we are beginning to both understand our hardware—what makes us tick (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/does-what-make-us-tick-also-make-us-tap/&quot;&gt;or tap&lt;/a&gt;)—and apply that understanding to building better products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you do this successfully, customers will be motivated to use your product. New product features will be adopted right away, the product will be engaging, and customer relationships will be stronger and longer-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;All this sounds good, but how do you get started? While there&amp;#x27;s no manual for how the brain works, thankfully, there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; models that can point us in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One such model captured by the acronym &amp;quot;SCARF.&amp;quot; Created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://davidrock.net/&quot;&gt;Dr. David Rock&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuroleadership.com/about-us/background/our-story&quot;&gt;NeuroLeadership Institute&lt;/a&gt; and author of the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Your-Brain-Work-Strategies-Distraction/dp/0061771295&quot;&gt;Your Brain at Work&lt;/a&gt;, the SCARF model helps you break down motivation across five major dimensions. Once you understand the SCARF model, you&amp;#x27;ll find you can apply it quickly to tease out new insights about how to build the kind of products your customers are motivated to use—and avoid demotivating product pitfalls, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The SCARF model is all about understanding motivation. So let&amp;#x27;s get to it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We Walk to Rewards ... And Run From Threats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In 2008, David Rock published &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuroleadership.com/portfolio-items/scarf-a-brain-based-model-for-collaborating-with-and-influencing-others/&quot;&gt;SCARF: A Brain-Based Model for Collaborating with and Influencing Others&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20100705024057/http://www.your-brain-at-work.com:80/files/NLJ_SCARFUS.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). Therein, Rock detailed his brain-based model for human motivation—one he created based on pouring over years of neurological research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it came to motivation, Rock observed a clear, simple pattern in the research: people classify stimuli as either &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; based on whether a given stimulus leads to a reward or threat. Here&amp;#x27;s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a stimulus is &lt;b&gt;rewarding&lt;/b&gt;, it&amp;#x27;s classified as &amp;quot;good.&amp;quot; We are motivated to &lt;b&gt;approach &lt;/b&gt;good stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a stimulus is a &lt;b&gt;threat&lt;/b&gt;, it&amp;#x27;s classified as &amp;quot;bad.&amp;quot; We are de-motivated by &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; stimuli, so we disengage or &lt;b&gt;avoid &lt;/b&gt;them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Encoding stimuli as &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; means they can be processed by the limbic brain. Simply put, the limbic brain operates at a subconscious level without recruiting the executive function—a.k.a. the prefrontal cortex. By avoiding the prefrontal cortex, stimuli are assessed rapidly while conserving resources. In situations of life and death, reacting quickly—and conserving energy—can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of note, &lt;b&gt;our brains pay outsized attention to potential threats&lt;/b&gt;. This makes evolutionary sense as missing a potential reward has a limited upside while the threat you miss could kill you. As Rock puts it, we walk toward rewards but run away from threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We walk toward rewards and run away from threats.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Simple. And now that you&amp;#x27;ve got this basic background on rewards and threats, you&amp;#x27;re ready to apply it using the SCARF model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The SCARF Model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;David Rock&amp;#x27;s SCARF Model is an easy way to remember the five major domains across which people assess stimuli as &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;bad,&amp;quot; rewards or threats. The acronym &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;SCARF&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; stands for &lt;b&gt;status&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;certainty&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;autonomy&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;relatedness&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;fairness&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each domain can be assessed independently though they ultimately all play a part. Below we will examine each domain in detail and then dive into discussion about how to apply SCARF to products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;S → Status&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Status&lt;/b&gt; concerns an individual&amp;#x27;s social standing—that is, where they fall in the &amp;quot;pecking order&amp;quot; or their place in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_hierarchy&quot;&gt;dominance hierarchy&lt;/a&gt;. Rock points out that status activates &amp;quot;primary reward circuitry&amp;quot; in the brain and highlights research on primates that connects higher status with lower baseline cortisol levels (i.e. lower stress and inflammation), as well as longer and healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s no surprise people are motivated to act in ways that positively improve their status. But perhaps more importantly, Rock points out that the &amp;quot;perception of a potential or real reduction in status can generate a strong threat response.&amp;quot; Citing research on social rejection, Rock notes that a hit to status can light up the same regions of the brain as physical pain. Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Expect people to approach things that improve status and to disengage or avoid things that threaten it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Status and your product&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask:&lt;/b&gt; How does my product elevate the status of users?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While this question is easily answered for luxury products, what about for software? How does your product improve the credibility of its users with peers? What about your product signals high value to external stakeholders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are countless products built almost exclusively to fight for status—e.g. see the most popular social media platforms. Within the product world, sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://dribbble.com/fullstory&quot;&gt;Dribbble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/search?q=fullstory&quot;&gt;ProductHunt&lt;/a&gt; are status machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The takeaway? Build outputs into your products that elevate the status of users, things that say, &amp;quot;Hey look at me! I&amp;#x27;m doing something important!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;C → Certainty&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Certainty&lt;/b&gt; is about our ability to make accurate predictions about the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rock talks about certainty by describing a simple task: picking up a cup of coffee. When you pick up a cup of coffee, your sensory system works with your motor cortex to ensure you hold the cup properly so it won&amp;#x27;t spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now imagine what happens when your hot mug is filled to the brim with a fresh pour of steaming hot coffee? Compared to the same, only half-full mug, it&amp;#x27;s hard to make accurate predictions about how your movements will effect the likelihood of spilling the coffee. A wavering grip could mean a mess or even burning your skin. If you choose to take a sip too fast or too soon, the coffee could burn your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rock writes that in the face of uncertainty:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain must use dramatically more resources, involving the more energy-intensive prefrontal cortex, to process moment-to-moment experience.
—David Rock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Uncertainty means you slow down, hesitate, procrastinate, avoid entirely, or disengage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While our hot coffee example may seem trivial, the takeaways readily apply to major everyday tasks. Let&amp;#x27;s say your boss just gave you a multi-month project to solve a complex product problem. Working the project requires long-range planning and coordinating efforts with numerous stakeholders across your organization. Will you see the project as a motivating opportunity or a possible threat you need to carefully assess? Your ability to confidently predict how this long-term project will unfold will inversely correlate to your anxiety and ambivalence about taking on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, contrast our fictional product project with a situation where you know just what to do. Here, the predictable nature of the project means a reward is certain. And you know you&amp;#x27;ll be motivated to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Certainty and your product&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask:&lt;/b&gt; How does the product assure users it does what it&amp;#x27;s says it does?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Analytics software is a useful example for understanding the importance of certainty. Your analytics are only as good as the data presented &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;what you can deduce from studying that data&lt;/a&gt;. Is the data trustworthy? Does it accurately reflect what&amp;#x27;s happening in my product? Can I use it to &lt;i&gt;confidently make business decisions&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because on the flipside, data you can&amp;#x27;t trust and analytics that lack clear actions result in uncertainty—and aren&amp;#x27;t likely to motivate users to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For a good example of how certainty can be built into a product, consider how certain retailers promote price-matching and free, fast shipping. Making it clear to customers they are guaranteed the best price and won&amp;#x27;t see hidden shipping fees at checkout goes a long way to removing uncertainty—and motivating action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A → Autonomy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Autonomy&lt;/b&gt; is about the power to exert control over your environment. It&amp;#x27;s the freedom to make choices. When you have autonomy, you&amp;#x27;re empowered to take action. Combined with certainty, autonomy is highly motivating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As Rock put it in his paper, autonomy is about the ability to &amp;quot;influence outcomes.&amp;quot; When you lack autonomy—say you want to pursue a course of action but lack the power to do so—you hit a motivational wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider the common, painful experience of feeling micro-managed. When you&amp;#x27;re micro-managed, not only means are you told what to do, a direct affront to your autonomy, you start to feel helpless about making any decisions whatsoever. You&amp;#x27;re too concerned any decisions you make will be quickly overturned by your manager. As a result, you simply don&amp;#x27;t act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you combine a lack of autonomy with &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;certainty, the impact on motivation is devastating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Autonomy and your product&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask:&lt;/b&gt; How does my product empower my users to act?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to digital products, autonomy is everything. Search functionality, fast loading pages, knowing where to look for answers (e.g. a Knowledge Base, Help Center), having clear calls to action—all of these things are ways to increase individual autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of course, allowing your users and customers to do &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; on your product may not be advisable because this can hurt &lt;b&gt;certainty&lt;/b&gt;. You must strike a balance between &amp;quot;all things are possible&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;you have a few options.&amp;quot; In fact, with autonomy, there&amp;#x27;s something to be said about limiting choices to reduce the cognitive load on your users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google is perhaps one of the most powerful, widely used digital products that when you think about it, is all about autonomy. Google empowers you to get answers to whatever question you have instantly, from anywhere, with almost no friction—plus it&amp;#x27;s free. Is it any surprise using search engines like Google makes users feel empowered—and motivated to act?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;R → Relatedness&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Relatedness&lt;/b&gt; has to do with feeling connected to other people—in particular people we identify as being similar to us. Feelings of connectedness are rewarding because we expect others who are similar to us to be think, act, and have similar desires to us, which makes them potentially helpful for our survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What does it mean to feel connected to another person? David Rock had this to say about relatedness in his paper:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Relatedness comes down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics/#empathy&quot;&gt;empathy&lt;/a&gt;. The more you empathize with someone else, the more you are motivated to help them ... because helping them is, in effect, like helping yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Relatedness has been seen as a highly motivating stimulus in the field of psychology for some time, and you can do a deep dive into relatedness as a persuasive tactic by picking up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X&quot;&gt;Robert Cialdini&amp;#x27;s book &lt;i&gt;Influence&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;i&gt;Influence&lt;/i&gt;, Cialdini talks about relatedness as &amp;quot;Liking,&amp;quot; and it&amp;#x27;s one of his six core principles of influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Relatedness and your product&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask:&lt;/b&gt; How does my product help me connect to others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Again, relatedness is all about empathy and identifying with others. While social networks might seem like good examples of products that drive empathy, that&amp;#x27;s not clear. In general, digital products make for challenging channels for driving relatedness due to the unavoidable wall—typically a screen—they put between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Still there are a few strong contenders. You&amp;#x27;ve likely heard about the &amp;quot;YouTube community.&amp;quot; What does that mean? If you&amp;#x27;ve ever followed a vlogger on YouTube, you know: watching videos of vloggers connects you to them in a way that is surprisingly personal. YouTube viewers feel connected—spoken to—by influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The same is true for Instagram influencers via the story function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Outside of video, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/digital-experience-empathy/&quot;&gt;FullStory&amp;#x27;s replay function is an empathy engine&lt;/a&gt;, an on-demand way to motivate through relatedness. Watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;recorded sessions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;struggling users&lt;/a&gt; in FullStory connects you to the real experience of using your digital product. It builds empathy. Watching a session replay gives developers the relatedness they need to feel motivated to fix bugs. This goes double for support agents seeking to solve customer problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And product managers feel connected to their users as they struggle to adopt a new feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;F → Fairness&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Humans have a hardwired desire for fairness. Consider the common refrain repeated by children everywhere, &amp;quot;That&amp;#x27;s not fair!&amp;quot; As any parent will tell you, when children insist they&amp;#x27;re being treated unfairly compared to siblings or friends, telling them, &amp;quot;Life&amp;#x27;s not fair&amp;quot; simply doesn&amp;#x27;t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;David Rock reports that, &amp;quot;Fair exchanges are intrinsically rewarding.&amp;quot; So regardless of the fairness or unfairness of life, when it comes to day-to-day interactions, maintaining the perception of fairness is important when it comes to motivating people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, avoiding the perception of unfairness—or injustice—is likely even more important as any sense of unfairness is likely to leave people running away, completely demotivated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fairness and your product&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask:&lt;/b&gt; Is my product fair?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Evaluating your product through the lens of fairness can be challenging. Here&amp;#x27;s one way to think about it: make sure your product clearly delivers value above and beyond its price. Products that outperform on value are assured to be loved by users and seen as a good deal—that is, &lt;i&gt;fair&lt;/i&gt;. While you&amp;#x27;re confident your product is of high-value, how do you ensure your users understand that value? It needs to be obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now consider the opposite situation. Products that are seen as expensive and overpriced will get no love from users. And if users feel stuck with your product because of some contract they had no control (autonomy!) over, it&amp;#x27;s especially demotivating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In these situations you can almost guarantee customers won&amp;#x27;t be motivated to use your product ... unless they have no choice. The worst part? These users are the ones likely to take their &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-best-products-will-win/&quot;&gt;frustration out online in the form of reviews&lt;/a&gt;—in the age of the Internet, this could be a death sentence for your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That&amp;#x27;s a wrap! 🧣 (for now)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;David Rock originally created the SCARF model to help individuals understand their own motivations as well as the motivations of others in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you can see, SCARF is also a powerful framework for teasing out insights about products.

Bad experiences mean lost customers, even when they love a brand. As companies increasingly understand and acknowledge the connection between positive customer experiences and the bottom line, agencies face more pressure than ever to make client sites and apps as easy and effortless to use as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In short, agencies are now on the clock to deliver CX perfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The path to providing more value to your clients—by eliminating CX potholes—is clear. Your clients want an agency that will don a hard hat for them, smooth out the bumps in their digital customer experience, and pave the way for conversion, retention, and advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That&amp;#x27;s where FullStory can help. We&amp;#x27;re proud to announce the FullStory Solutions Partner Program. The program is designed to make it easier than ever for product development, marketing, and customer success teams at digital agencies to wow clients with the CX insights and solutions made possible by FullStory&amp;#x27;s innovative technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory empowers your agency to be the go-to, indispensable source of expertise in all areas of digital customer experience. You&amp;#x27;ll be positioned to reap the financial rewards that come with activating new lines of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hitch Your Wagon to a Digital CX Trailblazer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is FullStory? Launched in 2014 and backed by Google Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, and Kleiner Perkins, FullStory has emerged as a category leader in digital experience intelligence. Thousands of customers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/love/&quot;&gt;love and trust our platform&lt;/a&gt; for analyzing, testing, visualizing, and perfecting the customer experience on their sites and apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you currently work with clients on their customer experience, or you&amp;#x27;re looking to enter the CX space for the first time, the value of our Solutions Partner Program is twofold. We&amp;#x27;ll coach you on how to use FullStory to deliver your existing services more efficiently and accurately, and we&amp;#x27;ll show you how to use our technology to unlock new business opportunities anchored to improving the digital customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your Definitive Answer to Every Client Question&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you put FullStory to work for your clients, the struggle of solving CX problems vanishes. Uncertainty is replaced with the confidence that comes from knowing just what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From capturing the digital experience of customers on your client&amp;#x27;s site or app, FullStory indexes everything so it can be searched, and presents it in a user-friendly platform. That means every single interaction—every click, tap, scroll, and mouse movement—is discoverable. With FullStory&amp;#x27;s pixel-perfect &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay technology&lt;/a&gt;, you can watch a visual re-creation of individual customer sessions in their entirety. And with our unique OmniSearch capabilities, it&amp;#x27;s exquisitely easy to investigate any type of CX issue, from a buggy interface to a high bounce rate—or even create multi-event funnels on-the-fly without advance set up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Traditional web analytics platforms tease insights but lack answers. FullStory turns that paradigm on its head. Now, it&amp;#x27;s easy to investigate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantitative trends and anomalies in your aggregate data&lt;/a&gt;. You simply use FullStory to scope problems in aggregate and then zoom &lt;i&gt;all the way in&lt;/i&gt; to reveal the underlying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;qualitative insights&lt;/a&gt; from the real-life customers who comprise it. (This works just as well in reverse, too!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Essentially, FullStory does for web analytics what instant replay does for sports: it changes the game. You get the insights needed to make definitive calls on product development, customer service, conversion rate optimization, bug diagnostics, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reduce Painful Uncertainty. Engage Clients Confidently&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Remember that big project—the one that &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to go exactly right? Remember the uncertainty and questions leading up to launch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;• What will we do if the conversion rate is low?
• What if users can&amp;#x27;t find what they&amp;#x27;re looking for?
• What if there&amp;#x27;s a bug?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Imagine you no longer had to worry. Now, you can confidently know just what the customer experience was because FullStory reveals that experience exactly how it happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory is the source of truth you need to prove that things are working just as planned. And if and when things don&amp;#x27;t go as planned, FullStory reveals a blueprint for fast, confident solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fuel Your Clients&amp;#x27; Growth With Glorious CX&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Is your agency ready to turn customer experience into a critical competitive advantage?

We call these concepts our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=watchword&quot;&gt;watchwords&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unlike traditional &amp;quot;corporate value statements&amp;quot; that are too easily forgotten or ignored, our watchwords are meant to be easy to grok so that we can truly put them into practice. And it works! People at FullStory do pay attention to how our day-to-day choices reflect (or fail to reflect) our watchwords. These words are mentioned far more than you might expect around the office, in meetings, documents, presentations, blog posts (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/3-steps-to-build-bionics/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/use-survey-for-marketing-attribution/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/use-empathy-to-build-better-products/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and, perhaps most meaningfully, in casual conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We wanted to share our watchwords publicly so that customers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/careers&quot;&gt;future colleagues&lt;/a&gt; can get a sense for how we think and what we value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Empathy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Care to understand how others feel&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Talking about empathy might sound touchy-feely, but empathy has supremely practical benefits. Caring to understand how others feel keeps one’s mind open to valuable information and viewpoints that don&amp;#x27;t originate inside one’s own head, which can lead to better decisions. And trust skyrockets when people feel genuinely heard and respected, making even difficult situations in the future warm and constructive. So, when it comes to how we work with colleagues at FullStory, while we may disagree on some topic—in fact, it&amp;#x27;s crucial to feel empowered to disagree—empathy reminds us that winning an argument is NOT the same as getting durable buy-in from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Does all this “empathy” stuff mean we think we’re, like, super-nice all the time or something? For example, do we think “the customer is always right?” Not necessarily, but there’s no denying that the customer is the sole authority on &lt;i&gt;how they feel&lt;/i&gt; about a situation. A habit of empathy reminds us not to assume that we properly understand a customer’s request (or question, or complaint) unless we have first made an effort to view the problem from their perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Clarity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Few problems can survive their thorough description&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Without clear communication, staying aligned while solving hard problems is next to impossible. Think of the effort your team goes through to kick off a major undertaking. You’ve organized a call to discuss the deliverables and timeline, but what if the meeting ends and everyone is still fuzzy on the details? If the project is scheduled to last weeks or months, isn&amp;#x27;t it worth taking another 10 minutes—or even much longer—to be absolutely sure everyone is crystal clear on the goals, scope, trade-offs, and fail-fast signals? The consequences of being misaligned compound quickly, and, especially if you intend (as we do) to empower individual contributors and avoid heavy-handed management, there’s really no alternative to being well-aligned...the only variable is how skilled your organization is at achieving the requisite clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That&amp;#x27;s also why we write internal documents and presentations for any non-trivial topic. The mere act of writing information down helps clarify it to everyone, including and especially the author. Creating a document also saves time down the road by avoiding the need to explain the topic repeatedly. In fact, we use writing to operationalize clarity in both &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/suck-less-cycle/&quot;&gt;The Suck Less Cycle&lt;/a&gt; (writing down our tenets of “dogma”) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/prove-its/&quot;&gt;Prove Its&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Clarity helps in other ways, too. The very act of describing a problem can often reveal its solution. For example, FullStory engineers make a habit of “talking to the fern”—the fern, as it were, is another engineer who mostly listens, smiles, and nods—to explain the symptoms of a tricky bug in excruciating detail. By the time they’ve finished fully putting the problem into words, the cause of the bug becomes obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Bionics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The human touch at superhuman scale&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Is it bionic?&amp;quot; If you were to visit the FullStory offices, that&amp;#x27;s one of the questions you would hear most frequently. What we&amp;#x27;re asking is whether it&amp;#x27;s possible to scale up an idea or innovation without scaling down the human element. As we build technology, can we design it to benefit the largest number of people without losing the essence of what makes high-touch, one-on-one interactions meaningful? Bionics is not a synonym for mere automation. Bionics reminds us to identify what makes a process great for people, and then apply mechanical leverage to &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;. Scale something worth scaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A simple example of bionics is making a bigger-than-normal investment in the design of a great self-service help portal to ensure customers can find the answers they need without filing a support ticket—and regardless of their time zone or whether your support team is asleep. In the spirit of bionics, you could increase the human touch even more by localizing the content and design to the reader’s region. The payoff: for every support ticket you don’t have to spend time answering thanks to your extraordinary help portal, you have more time to do something else instead. Your support agents are happier, having avoided “the death by a thousand cuts,” and your customers feel more empowered. (Our support team spends 60% of their time in the support queue and 40% on projects, including ways to make FullStory more bionic.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For more ideas on bionics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/3-steps-to-build-bionics/&quot;&gt;read this recent post from Jaclyn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Watchwords Help Us Operationalize Our Values&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The concepts of Empathy, Clarity, and Bionics are meant to be disarmingly simple and trivial to remember. They spring to mind easily and frequently, so that without really trying, they become habits. We hope these habits shape for the better how we treat each other inside of FullStory and how we create an unusually positive experience for our customers in interactions and (bionically!) through the FullStory platform itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The tale of gRPCurl]]></title><description><![CDATA[gRPCurl is a command-line tool that allows you to query your gRPC servers.

Perhaps—finally—you have the digital intelligence you need to help your organization make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Only, as the weeks go by with countless hours spent mining and monitoring metrics, you&amp;#x27;re left with a nagging suspicion something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But what is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What Does Security Have to Do With Signaling?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A little over ten years ago, security expert Bruce Schneier wrote &lt;i&gt;Beyond Fear&lt;/i&gt; and coined the phrase &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater&quot;&gt;security theater&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/analytics-theater/#fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; Security theater is when an organization engages in behaviors that &lt;i&gt;signal&lt;/i&gt; security even if those activities don&amp;#x27;t provide any additional, real security, at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The most commonly cited examples of security theater in recent years tend to involve the TSA—that is, airport security—but if you&amp;#x27;ve ever noticed the blinking red light in your locked car you&amp;#x27;ve witnessed a bit of security theater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Security theater is a form of signaling. What&amp;#x27;s signaling? Signaling is when information is communicated indirectly through a medium separate from the underlying reality. E.g. gestures, actions, products, behaviors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Signaling is everywhere—from banks being made of marble, signaling wealth and stability, to little &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1PID91sEW8&quot;&gt;puffer fish creating &amp;quot;art&amp;quot; on the ocean floor to signal fitness to potential mates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/analytics-theater/#fn2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You might think of signaling as advertising—trying to convey information about something more complex. When signaling works, the signals act as a useful proxy—a kind of hueristic. When signals &lt;i&gt;don&amp;#x27;t&lt;/i&gt; work, they take on a life of their own. They can become a confusing distraction or worse, lead to making poorly informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Security theater is an example of wasteful signaling—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/01/tsa-business-security-theater-not-security/357599/&quot;&gt;sending a costly message of safety that doesn&amp;#x27;t hold up under scrutiny&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what does this have to do with web analytics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How Charts and Graphs Put On a Show&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The purpose of analysis is to distill complex underlying realities into salient insights—the kind that inform decisions. Just like signals. The signals in analyses come in the form of visualizations (charts, graphs, etc.) and metrics. Consider this trend line:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Without knowing anything about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; behind the chart, what&amp;#x27;s the signal? You might guess that this graph represents an underlying reality that is &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt;. If you saw this kind of graph in the context of a presentation—accompanied by a narrative you have no reason to question—you&amp;#x27;d likely begin to nod your head in understanding. &lt;i&gt;This is good.&lt;/i&gt; After all, up and to the right means warm fuzzies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now look at this next trend line. It presents a very different, yet equally clear visual story:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ouch&lt;/i&gt;. That doesn&amp;#x27;t look good ... someone has some explaining to do!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What&amp;#x27;s going on here? As discerning as we may be, when you run into enough analytics, you inevitably become trained to draw conclusions. You process visualizations instantly without a critical thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here we see signaling at work. Remember: the power of signals is that they can tell us something without us having to think critically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This lack of critical thinking can create problems because decisions made based on signals have real consequences. Instead of mindless nodding, we might be better served taking a second look. The next time you see some warm fuzzy-generating chart—or wince-inducing graph, let that be a different kind of signal—one to start asking critical questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the graph accurately represent the underlying reality?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the &amp;quot;insight&amp;quot; you&amp;#x27;re getting telling you something &lt;i&gt;useful&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am I better able to do my job because of this analysis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If &amp;quot;No&amp;quot; is the answer to any of the above questions, your analytics signals may have gone off the rails—you may be experiencing &lt;b&gt;analytics theater&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The fact is the savior, as long as you don’t jam it into some preconceived pattern. The greatest obstacle to discovery is not ignorance—it is the illusion of knowledge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;—Daniel Boorstein&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now Introducing Analytics Theater&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is &amp;quot;analytics theater?&amp;quot; It&amp;#x27;s when your web analytics serve up metrics, charts, graphs, and more that give the appearance of valuable insights—while being near useless and/or poorly reflecting what&amp;#x27;s actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Analytics theater is a show of signals that seem like insights—but are more like noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You&amp;#x27;ve certainly experienced analytics theater. Very likely, you may have even put on a show, yourself. These days, it&amp;#x27;s too easy to razzle dazzle with data. (Finding true insights is hard.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That said, there are a few places you&amp;#x27;re more likely to run into analytics theater. Here are a few common offenders:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automatically generated &lt;b&gt;dashboards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monthly reports &lt;/b&gt;(particularly if they trot out the same metrics)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ad-hoc &lt;b&gt;analyses that backfit data to justify decisions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Powerpoint presentations &lt;/b&gt;with slides and slides of graphs and numbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And you&amp;#x27;re right: &lt;b&gt;None of the above instances need necessarily be analytics theater&lt;/b&gt;. There are plenty of useful reports and dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, next time you see that whizbang dashboard with all its metrics and graphic visualizations, ask questions. Are the analytics signaling something insightful or simply summarizing performance? Having read through the &amp;quot;insights&amp;quot; in your report, do you feel compelled to take specific action?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your analytics leave you with little more than good feeling, perhaps there are better ways to spend your time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Most Insightful Analytics Drive Actions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you want to know if the signals you get from your analytics are more than theater, direct your attention to outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do your analytics help you determine what you should do next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do they empower you to dig deeper for additional information?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do your most important metrics tell you enough to make a decision?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The best analytics produce insights that help you decide and &lt;i&gt;drive you to take action&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They motivate you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Isn&amp;#x27;t it Time You Expected More From Your Web Analytics?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A little bit of analytics theater is harmless and unavoidable. Who doesn&amp;#x27;t like the occasional warm fuzzy—like seeing DAUs (or revenue!) go up and to the right? And sure, sometimes a &amp;quot;status update&amp;quot; is all you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Just don&amp;#x27;t confuse those signals for the kind of insights on which you can take action.

The round was led by New York-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://stripes.co/&quot;&gt;Stripes&lt;/a&gt;, a new investor to the group, with additional new investor Dell Technologies Capital joining alongside existing investors GV (formerly Google Ventures), Kleiner Perkins, and Salesforce Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since launching in 2014, FullStory has grown to be trusted by thousands of customers globally, helping product, developer, marketing, and support teams (among others) in SaaS and eCommerce companies large and small. Our goal has always been to help our customers &lt;i&gt;help their customers&lt;/i&gt; through revealing the hits and misses, problems and opportunities in the digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory aims to tell you when, where, and why you are losing CX-related revenue and operationalizes concern for the digital customer experience across organizations in a secure, scalable, and privacy-compliant way. The resulting insights are actionable, intuitive, real-time, and easy-to-access for organizations big and small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This Series C funding marks a major milestone in our journey—though we’re already racing toward that next marker. We’ve got big plans to use these funds to further evolve our digital experience platform into an engine for digital intelligence. Seriously, gang, there are some cool things in the works. We want to make FullStory the critical place where product managers, developers, marketers and support professionals—anyone with a stake in the online experience of a site or app—go to find the answers they need to important questions that are presently unanswerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While we are already thinking ahead to the future we want to build, given this big moment, we have a chance to take a step back and reflect on how far we’ve come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Looking Back&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over the last two years, our platform has grown tremendously. FullStory now indexes trillions of events for thousands of customers, making it easier than ever to find, analyze, and understand their digital experiences through on-the-fly, behavior-based funnel analytics, auto-detected frustration signals, daily active user trends and metrics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/heatmap/&quot;&gt;heat maps&lt;/a&gt;, Dev Tools, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Through integrations with FullStory, our customers can unlock even more value from their existing software stack. For example, with our recent launch of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/custom-events-in-fullstory/&quot;&gt;Custom Events&lt;/a&gt;,” which improves our integration with Segment and Tealium, critical digital experience moments that customers have already instrumented can be seamlessly searched and analyzed directly in FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Apart from the product, the FullStory ecosystem of partners is growing, too. We launched our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-solutions-partner-program/&quot;&gt;Solutions Partner Program&lt;/a&gt; just two months ago, creating exciting new opportunities for digital agencies and consulting firms to use FullStory to help their clients deliver world-class digital experiences. The program has over 60 partners globally and is adding more teams every week as service oriented organizations realize the competitive advantage that FullStory unlocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How have we accomplished so much in so little time? Through tremendous, consistent effort, robust operational processes, a product with incredible power and scale, and a growing and wonderful team of people. Speaking of people, since we completed our last funding round in May 2017, we’ve grown from around 45 to 175 FullStorians, adding more every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Not surprisingly, we outgrew our current office space many months ago. We eagerly anticipate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/we-need-more-room/&quot;&gt;opening of our new headquarters&lt;/a&gt; off Peachtree Street in the next two weeks. FullStory “HQ4” will make it possible for our company to add over 100 more friendly faces over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Even with all this growth, the future is what excites us the most.  We still have so much to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back to the Future!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to Gartner, “Customer experience (CX) is emerging from organizational silos and is becoming a cross-organizational, board-level focus. Respondents to the 2018 Gartner Survey prioritized customer analytics as the No.1 investment to improve the customer experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Organizations prioritize customer experiences because they know: success will only come through meeting—and exceeding—the exceptionally high expectations of customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Which is where FullStory comes in. At FullStory we believe everyone benefits from a more perfect online experience. That’s why we’re evolving our digital experience platform to give organizations the customer insights they need in a way that is fast, reliable, and secure—all while breaking down organizational silos so that everyone works off the same source of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now Let&amp;#x27;s Get Back to Work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, as we celebrate this milestone in our company’s history and ready ourselves for the future, we want to say thanks to our customers who have made FullStory their trusted digital experience platform. We’re excited to have new investors on our journey with us as this gives us more fuel to grow and develop our product while our everyday continues to be all about you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re interested in helping us build this future, &lt;i&gt;yes&lt;/i&gt;, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/jobs&quot;&gt;We’re hiring&lt;/a&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How FullStory enhances Salesforce and deepens customer insights]]></title><description><![CDATA[FullStory session replay combines with Salesforce to support customers more efficiently and drive customer success more effectively. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/integrate-salesforce-with-fullstory</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/integrate-salesforce-with-fullstory</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sanjay Bharadhwaj Vijayaraghava]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2019 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Amplify your customer support and customer success efforts with the FullStory⇆Salesforce integration.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As the world&amp;#x27;s largest CRM platform, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/products/what-is-salesforce/&quot;&gt;Salesforce&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful tool for tens of thousands of companies, assisting everything from customer relationship management to customer support, customer success, and more—and &amp;quot;more&amp;quot; now includes extending Salesforce with deep customer insights provided by FullStory search and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s what the integration can do for you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connect &lt;b&gt;Salesforce &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Service &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cloud &lt;/b&gt;to FullStory and never have to ask for a screenshot again.

The challenge is that support tickets can be terribly vague and unclear—customers struggle to explain just what isn&amp;#x27;t working, or what broke on your site or with your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Could you take a screenshot?&amp;quot; ... &amp;quot;Could you walk me through what you were doing?&amp;quot; These common support questions have been nearly unavoidable and result in complex, hard to understand answers. They can quickly take a bad customer experience and make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The problem of understanding context around a support ticket goes away with FullStory. With FullStory, you just replay the customer&amp;#x27;s session, watch what they did, and understand exactly what they saw that led to them filing a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How the FullStory Lightning Component appears on the Case page in Salesforce. Here you get a full list of the customers sessions to investigate exactly what problem they were experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How Salesforce &lt;i&gt;Service&lt;/i&gt; Cloud ⇆ FullStory Works&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the Salesforce Service Cloud integration with FullStory, you never need to ask for a screenshot again. Customer problems automatically have the most recent FullStory session recordings for the user alongside the case. Your support professionals can review customer sessions for the much-needed context around a customer&amp;#x27;s problem. With FullStory, you can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/want-to-co-browse-with-your-customers-in-real-time-go-live-with-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Go Live&amp;quot; and co-browse with your customers&lt;/a&gt; to see what they see in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The result is fewer touches, greater clarity, faster resolution, and improved customer support metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Plus &lt;i&gt;happier customers&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch how you can proactively help a struggling customer who ran into an error on your site in this short video (0:43, no sound):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory ⇆ Salesforce &lt;i&gt;Sales&lt;/i&gt; Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Problem: Understand the Customer&amp;#x27;s Current Experience With Your Product&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You&amp;#x27;re managing a relationship with a newly created customer. How is their experience with your product going? What parts of the product have they tried? Where are they struggling? What are they missing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Traditionally, the only way to know the answers to these questions is to ask the customer directly. This process can be tedious for the customer who struggles to articulate their features, fails to remember their specific interactions, and doesn&amp;#x27;t have time to waste helping you do your job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With FullStory&amp;#x27;s integration, you can see—like watching a video replay—just what the customer has been doing across all their online session recordings, giving you the context you need when you talk to them about how well—or not so well—their experience is going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Details: How Salesforce &lt;i&gt;Sales&lt;/i&gt; Cloud ⇆ FullStory Works&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory records all of your customer&amp;#x27;s sessions online so that you can replay their experiences, and by watching these video-like recordings, you can determine how they have been using your product, what features they have tried (or not), and what questions they might have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch this brief video (0:44, no sound) for an overview of how the integration connects Salesforce Sales Cloud and FullStory. Notice how by watching the session replay, you can tease out the interests of a prospect to personalize your correspondence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to Get Started With the Integration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Salesforce ⇆ FullStory integration uses Salesforce AppExchange and there are a handful of steps you&amp;#x27;ll need to go through to get fully set up with FullStory for Service Cloud and Sales Cloud. Open up &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828973&quot;&gt;our Knowledge Base article to get started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The end result is that you can use the FullStory Lightning Component in Salesforce on any record page. Use the included configuration for Cases, Contacts, or Leads pages, or add your own configuration for other objects. Wherever the FullStory component is present, you&amp;#x27;ll get a list of sessions that correspond to the customer in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But Wait: Privacy Matters!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your users care about privacy, and so do you! Users entrust you with their personal data, and you don’t want to share that data with other systems unnecessarily. The Salesforce ⇆ FullStory integration can be configured to fetch user sessions using an anonymous user ID, rather than a user’s email address. No need to send email addresses or any other personal information into FullStory!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now go and drive customer success with Salesforce and FullStory!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why you should optimize customer support for queue-based performance]]></title><description><![CDATA[Optimize your customer support organization and create happier support professionals, more loyal customers, and a better quality product.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/optimize-support-for-performance-and-quality</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/optimize-support-for-performance-and-quality</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben McCormack]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2019 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’ve noticed a pattern when talking to people who have worked in customer support at early-stage startups. As someone who runs customer support teams, I’m always interested in connecting with people who have this experience, regardless of how short their stint was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The conversation will go something like this, starting with me asking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;  Oh, you handled support at Company X. Why did you leave X?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Them:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;  I loved support. I was clearing the inbox every day, but I was getting burned out. When I talked to my boss about adding someone else to the team, the conversation didn’t go anywhere.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;  So what’d you do?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Them:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;  I left for a position in a different role at Company Y.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;  What happened to support at X when you left?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Them:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Oh, right. They ended up hiring 3 people to keep up with the inbox.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Maybe I’m missing something, but some back-of-the-napkin math says her manager could have added one person to the team like she recommended, given her a 50% raise, and still come out ahead. And the customers wouldn’t be left adrift while three new support hires learn the ropes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So why didn’t that happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s this weird thing in customer support where we’re almost shy about rewarding—with higher salaries—queue-based performance. The doubts, which take about 30 seconds to conceive, sound something like this: “But support is much more than answering tickets,” or perhaps, “Throughput is nice, but what about &lt;i&gt;quality&lt;/i&gt; responses?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ll deal with the objections in a second. First, we have to recognize how we stand to benefit by properly valuing queue-based performance in customer support. Imagine a world where you’re able to attract and retain the very best people to support your customers &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;create a closed feedback loop for improving the product in response to what customers value. The result would be better products and happier customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Optimizing for queue-based performance will help you create that world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why you should optimize for queue-based performance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First, let’s narrow the scope of our discussion to speak specifically of customer support at growth-minded product companies where (1) customer experience is a differentiator and (2) support professionals are expected to help shape the product to serve evolving customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Both points are important. If you value customer experience as critical to the success of your brand, you want highly skilled individuals serving your customers—and you want to figure out how to retain those individuals. To the second point, if you intend to improve your product in response to what customers value, it’s crucial for the same smart people who interact with your customers on a regular basis to be vocal champions of their wants and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you say, “Yes, I want someone who is an expert at this technical craft of delivering high-quality customer service, can do it very quickly and empathetically, &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;provide crucial feedback to the product team.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Then, you should optimize for that—and be willing to pay a premium for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because when it comes to throughput, the more adept and empathetic your support professional is at solving tickets, the faster they’ll get through the queue. Then, they’ll be able to bionically build those solutions into the product. Either way results in happier customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, let’s look at the objections that might be raised to this type of performance-based model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objection! What About Quality?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Quality matters. If Nathan replies to 60 customers in a day and Alex replies to 40 customers—but Nathan’s replies appear rushed and tone-deaf compared to Alex&amp;#x27;s empathetic responses—you’ll rightly question the value Nathan is providing in terms of quality customer service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To optimize for queue-based performance, you first have to control for quality. How do you do that?  At FullStory, we’re using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maestroqa.com/&quot;&gt;MaestroQA&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate our responses to customers based on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics/&quot;&gt;watchwords of empathy, clarity, and bionics&lt;/a&gt;. Other ways to control for quality include Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), Customer Effort Score (CES), and Net Promoter Score (NPS), each with their own benefits and tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Even while having high standards for quality, we’ve noticed that the very best people in customer support can deliver &lt;i&gt;quality&lt;/i&gt; responses very quickly. They’re able to serve more customers in a shorter amount of time without sacrificing a warm, personable tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objection! Isn’t Support About More Than Just Answering Tickets?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The most responsive way to support customers is by improving the product. Meaning, if you have a bug that generates a significant number of customer emails per day and you have a choice to respond faster (perhaps by adding headcount to customer support) or to fix the underlying problem (perhaps by forwarding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/debugging-with-session-replay/&quot;&gt;all the relevant information to engineering&lt;/a&gt;), you’d likely choose the latter so that customers no longer encounter the bug in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By rewarding queue-based performance, the objection goes, you’re valuing responsiveness at the expense of improving the product. This is a valid concern, and if people in customer support spend 100% of their time in the support queue, they won’t have time to come up for air to create the feedback loops necessary to improving the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thankfully, this challenge can be overcome. At FullStory, we control for this problem by structuring customer support so that our senior practitioners spend &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/when-working-the-support-queue-less-is-more/&quot;&gt;40% of their time outside of the queue&lt;/a&gt;. Not only does this ensure we retain the best people—burnout is real, y’all—it also ensures that the people closest to the customer maintain a direct feedback loop with the product team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Set the Bar High&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once we’ve controlled for quality of response and for the feedback loop to improve the product, we’re in a place where it makes sense to figure out how to value high performers in the customer support queue. To value high performers, you can create individual contributor levels within the practice and justify higher compensation bands at the higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, at FullStory, you can’t be a senior member of customer support without being an expert at your craft. We set the bar high and structure the practice in such a way so we can attract and retain the best talent. We look at expertise in three broad areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communication with customers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queue-based productivity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra-queue-rricular work 😉&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These criteria drive the levels that help us distinguish between a senior member of customer support and someone who is newer to the craft. Senior members are able to handle the most difficult customer conversations, serve more customers in less time, and execute higher-leverage work with their time outside of the queue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The nice thing about having clear criteria is that the math works out. If one of the outputs of customer support is providing high-quality responses to customers, it makes sense to pay people more if they’re able to support more customers in less time, assuming you control for quality and the feedback loops that improve the product. Bonus: giving customer support professionals time outside of the queue is itself a much-appreciated benefit that helps you to attract and retain the best talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Queue-Based Performance is a Win-Win-Win&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You might be thinking, &amp;quot;This is great. But will it work for my team?&amp;quot; It&amp;#x27;s a good question. We know that what works for us may not work for all organizations. For starters, if you&amp;#x27;re not using a product like FullStory to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/session-replay-customer-support/&quot;&gt;connect the online experiences of your customers to their requests for help&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., support tickets), your workflow will be markedly different. For example, using FullStory means we don&amp;#x27;t need to ask our customers for screenshots or lengthy explanations about what they were doing before they reached out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, we&amp;#x27;re a SaaS company. (For &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; context, we serviced 1200 tickets in the last month.)  SaaS customers are demanding folks. They expect a lot out of the products they spend so much money on—products they rely on to do their job. Having an efficient, master-level support team is a must-have if you want happy customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For other businesses—say, eCommerce—the support model can change in meaningful ways. But the human nature of your customers? Same as it ever was. Delivering exceptional customer support can make all the difference between being a Kmart or a Nordstrom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you’re a SaaS startup or an established eCommerce company, it’s our hope that these tips will help you think differently about support and how to prioritize employees who excel at delivering fast, empathetic answers to your customers’ most pressing needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you should optimize for queue-based performance, you might find that doing so yields happier employees, more loyal customers, and significantly higher-quality products and experiences—we sure did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

Fundamentally, FullStory&amp;#x27;s session replay works by recording DOM mutations on the page. So, we&amp;#x27;re able to record changes to web components in the same way that we&amp;#x27;d record changes to all other basic HTML elements in a browser. You can read more about the DOM and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;how session replay works&lt;/a&gt; in our Definitive Guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Recently, it&amp;#x27;s become popular for developer frameworks to nest something called a &amp;quot;Shadow DOM&amp;quot; within custom web components. Shadow DOMs are useful because they are reusable, configurable custom elements that don’t clash with any other CSS or JavaScript on the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Historically, FullStory was unable to capture content within Shadow DOMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But&lt;b&gt; now we can.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why We Built Shadow DOM Support for FullStory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to improve customer experiences on the web, you need to deeply understand a customer&amp;#x27;s end-to-end experience. And in order to deeply understand a customer&amp;#x27;s end-to-end experience, you need a complete picture of their behavior—preferably one that is built from the ground up while also capable of being analyzed from the topdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Replaying a customer&amp;#x27;s online experience in FullStory gives you that ground truth. And where FullStory goes further is by enabling you to measure and analyze customer interactions with specific elements &lt;i&gt;in aggregate&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For FullStory&amp;#x27;s unique qualitative &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;quantitative approach to function, it&amp;#x27;s critical we continuously adapt our recording capabilities to support popular technologies. As we saw more and more developers adopting modern frameworks that rely on web components and Shadow DOM, we knew it would be important to close the &amp;quot;blind spots&amp;quot; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; for those customers ... that is, if it was possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Well, as it turns out, it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; possible—so, we did it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What the Tech?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At this point, you&amp;#x27;re probably thinking either:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Excellent, this blog post answered my question about whether FullStory supports Shadow DOM and I&amp;#x27;m ready to move on with my day&amp;quot; or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have absolutely no clue what you&amp;#x27;re talking about, Joel.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you find yourself in camp B and you&amp;#x27;re also curious to learn more, I&amp;#x27;d invite you to read for a bit more about how the technology works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Web Components 101&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Web Components” is a general term that refers to the practice of creating reusable, custom HTML elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, instead of using a semantic, standard HTML element such as a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag (paragraph) or &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag (container), you could create your own custom HTML element such as a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;joels-awesome-special-module-thingy&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and let that represent a specific type of component on your website or web app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By default, the browser treats those custom HTML elements like they&amp;#x27;d treat any regular HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. As we mentioned earlier, for simple web components that are custom elements but don&amp;#x27;t employ the Shadow DOM, FullStory has long been able to record those elements in the same way that we&amp;#x27;d record all other basic &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements in a browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What we did in our most recent recording upgrade was extend the ability to record the Shadow DOM elements nested &lt;i&gt;within&lt;/i&gt; those custom web components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why Use Shadow DOM&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Shadow DOMs are useful because they are self-contained and reusable. They allow developers to write code and styles for a part of a webpage in isolation without conflicting with rules that affect the rest of the page styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s How Shadow DOMs Work&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When a web component includes a Shadow DOM, the browser initiates a special little DOM subtree that can include HTML, CSS, and other code that&amp;#x27;s specific only to that web component. Similar to how page-level CSS style rules can&amp;#x27;t apply to code within an iframe (because they can&amp;#x27;t &amp;quot;reach&amp;quot; that code to modify it), style rules in the containing/host page can&amp;#x27;t apply to code within a Shadow DOM&amp;#x27;s subtree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But, unlike content loaded via iframes, web components with Shadow DOM are much more lightweight and performant. They also work much better at scale. Components can easily fit within the page where they&amp;#x27;re rendered instead of being hosted at many different unique locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For this reason, lots of popular web frameworks such as Angular and React have begun supporting web components with Shadow DOM as part of their libraries. We&amp;#x27;re also seeing developers take up web components as a way of implementing design systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;(For more on Shadow DOM, check out the Shadow DOM &lt;a href=&quot;https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#shadow-trees&quot;&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM&quot;&gt;explainer&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What Shadow DOM Recording Means For You&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re already a customer of FullStory, you shouldn&amp;#x27;t notice much of a change: Expect FullStory to record the web components on your website or web app as well as any nested elements within them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, if you tried FullStory in the past and were disappointed to find that we couldn&amp;#x27;t support your Shadow DOM setup, we hope you&amp;#x27;ll give us another try.

That&amp;#x27;s why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pandadoc.com/&quot;&gt;PandaDoc&lt;/a&gt; developed their cloud-based software tool: to help remove the burdens typically associated with creating and managing sales documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By digitizing and streamlining document processes, PandaDoc helps salespeople close more deals—and close them faster. And for a software company whose raison d&amp;#x27;être is to save busy salespeople time, a hiccup-free digital experience is an absolute imperative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To help them better achieve this goal, PandaDoc turned to FullStory&amp;#x27;s experience analytics expertise to gain a more rigorous understanding of their customers&amp;#x27; behavior, surface usability issues, and quickly implement optimizations and fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Recently, we met with the Product, Customer Support, and Development teams at PandaDoc in order to discover the specific ways FullStory helped PandaDoc close the deal on a seamless digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Observe your users in the wild, not in captivity  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Prior to discovering FullStory, Nathan and his team relied solely on traditional usability testing to observe customer behavior. They continue to run these types of tests because they can produce insights. The problem is they often also produce a bunch of headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Too often, user testing forces us to rely on paid participants rather than actual PandaDoc users, leaving us with doubts about the validity of our findings. And even when we are able to run user testing on our user base instead of artificial participants, the process of getting opt-ins is so expensive and inefficient that it’s challenging to run at scale. —Nathan Lippi, Product Manager for Growth and Insight, PandaDoc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In short, the process causes panda-monium.

Traditional user testing—with its inherent biases and artificiality—can be like watching animals in a zoo. They might play to the crowd. They might be indifferent. Or they might not appear at all, even though you&amp;#x27;ve had their usability test appointment scheduled for weeks and confirmed it with them numerous times.

As useful as observing user testers can be, the observations can feel forced.

Indeed, the only way to get a full, authentic picture of how your users behave is to observe users in their natural habitat. And that&amp;#x27;s what FullStory has enabled PandaDoc to do: study the behaviors of their actual customers using the product during real sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A key differentiator that separates PandaDoc from its competitors is its built-in document editor. Through features like one-click uploading, a drag-and-drop interface, reusable proposal templates, and a ready-to-use content library, the editor cuts the time it takes to create fully customizable, highly professional proposals and contracts by up to 65%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ensure optimum user onboarding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;PandaDoc is in the process of releasing a supercharged version of this editor, and while its core editing features allow for the creation of beautiful, highly flexible documents with fewer clicks, the team was unsure how new users would respond to the not-yet-battle-tested interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The PandaDoc team had many questions. They needed answers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would users react to the new onboarding flows?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How difficult would it be to discover all the goodies under the hood?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which parts of the reimagined interfaces would cause confusion for users?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, how could the PandaDoc team make sure the new editor’s value shined through?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nathan and the product team relied on FullStory to answer each of these questions. They searched in FullStory for the segment of actual users who navigated through the new workflow. They replayed user sessions to see, with their own eyes, what was working smoothly and what wasn&amp;#x27;t. And they used this knowledge to tweak the interface to be more relevant and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s what Nathan had to say about the process: &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;Before we took the plunge and watched dozens of FullStory sessions of people using Editor 2.0, we were really confident in our new interface. As we watched FullStory recordings of users, we realized that there was still more work to do. New users were getting stuck on what seemed to us to be easy tasks. After this discovery, we were able to go in and get some relatively quick wins.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Editor 2.0 is still a work in progress, but all the customer-focused work is paying off. The new editor already has a meaningfully higher NPS score than the previous editor, and the team only expects this score to grow—with continued help from FullStory, of course. —Nathan Lippi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By acting on the real user insights uncovered from FullStory, the PandaDoc team insured the success of their new Editor 2.0, resulting in higher NPS scores and happier customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get all the other giant-sized benefits:  Customer support, debugging, and QA testing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;PandaDoc has also used FullStory to transform the way they solve digital experience issues through customer support, debugging, and QA testing. Every time a customer contacts PandaDoc with an issue, a support professional can pull up the replay of their session to see exactly what they were in the midst of doing and precisely where things went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Katya Barsuk, Head of Support at PandaDoc, calls FullStory &amp;quot;invaluable:&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our support team has found FullStory to be invaluable. Knowing the exact nature of the issue that customers experienced without having to bombard them with questions makes resolutions so much faster and more pleasant for everyone. —Katya Barsuk, Head of Support, PandaDoc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Similarly, PandaDoc developers are no longer stuck receiving bug reports with details so scarce it might take days or weeks to fill in the gaps. Instead, through an &lt;a href=&quot;https://bionic.fullstory.com/react-redux-errors-with-fullstory-and-sentry/&quot;&gt;integration with Sentry&lt;/a&gt;, when an error occurs the development team gets notified in Slack. Then, each error report links directly to the session replay showing in absolute detail what the issue looked like to the customer who experienced it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The combination of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;visual information from replay&lt;/a&gt;, along with session metadata such as UserAgent data, viewport, and more, ensures PandaDoc developers get everything they need to replicate bugs and resolve tickets in less time than it takes a giant panda to work up an appetite. PandaDoc developer Dmitry Volokh shares:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The FullStory + Sentry integration has significantly sped up bug investigation —at times by a factor of 10. —Dmitry Volokh, Developer, PandaDoc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tanya Aulachynskaya, Product Lead, Core Unit is just as enthusiastic about the ways that FullStory can improve QA testing. &amp;quot;Every time we roll out a mission-critical update, we &amp;#x27;canary test&amp;#x27; it with a small percentage of customers, and we watch FullStory closely, looking for bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“So far, in 100% of these QA tests we&amp;#x27;ve found an important bug that would have otherwise gone straight into production and caused meaningful problems for our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Plan a game night&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One of the best ways to get the maximum value out of FullStory is to make watching sessions a spectator sport. Gather your coworkers for a night (or day) of analyzing user sessions (as if watching game film), observing customer interactions, and bonding over &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-session-replay-dvr-for-website/&quot;&gt;wins and winces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Recently, PandaDoc team members did exactly that. Assembled in their Belarus office, they replayed hundreds of FullStory sessions on a Saturday they dubbed “Customer Empathy Day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As they watched sessions, the team learned, celebrated, and &lt;i&gt;winced&lt;/i&gt; together: They shared the joy of seeing things go right, and, conversely, the disappointment when users struggled. And perhaps most importantly, they left with valuable insights and action items, notably regarding their mobile sign-up process, the kind of insights they can use to improve their product immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Vik Kuushynau, Head of Product at PandaDoc, said this about the Game Film experience:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that FullStory allows our team to see how our customers use the platform is very meaningful. Moving forward, this Game Film meeting is going to continue to be a valuable part of how we raise organizational awareness of our users’ needs. —Vik Kuushynau, Head of Product, PandaDoc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Make the digital customer experience your product team’s competitive advantage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We&amp;#x27;re proud to help PandaDoc take their digital customer experience to the next level, and we want to thank the product team for sharing the amazing results they&amp;#x27;ve experienced with FullStory so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discover how FullStory can help your organization: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get a demo of the platform today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How many sessions do I actually need to watch?]]></title><description><![CDATA[How many sessions do you really need to watch?

For many of our customers, FullStory’s session replay is their first experience gathering behavioral insights at scale and they dive in head first!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Often, when people get FullStory up and running on their site, they quickly find themselves watching session after session &lt;i&gt;after session&lt;/i&gt; with no end in sight. Before long, they ask one of the most common questions we hear at FullStory:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many sessions do I actually need to watch? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is a great question, and a really common one, especially coming from people who have less experience working with qualitative behavioral data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The good news is you can get a great deal of value from watching far fewer sessions than you might guess. Let’s explore how!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Follow the Rule of Five&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s the short answer: 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watching five sessions per study (More on “studies” in a minute) will help you uncover roughly 80% of major usability problems. In addition, watching significantly more end-users will often fail to provide you with &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; additional insights and could very well be a giant waste of time. This is, in short, similar to the effect of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns&quot;&gt;diminishing marginal returns&lt;/a&gt; from economics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you can see in the graph above, as you add more and more user tests to your research you gather fewer and fewer additional new insights. You only need to see the same issue so many times before you are informed enough to make meaningful changes to your digital property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Replay five sessions &lt;i&gt;per study&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because a digital property has so much surface area, you can’t optimize the entire thing by watching only five session replays. You have to break your digital property up into smaller “chunks” of digital experience for this method to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is where “studies” come in. As defined here, a “study&amp;quot; has two main components. The first is the portion (think bite-sized) of your site or app you are looking to optimize—that is, the digital experience chunk. The second component is the group of end-users interacting with that piece of your digital property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It is okay to go with your gut when determining how large the chunk of digital experience you want to study should be, but as a rule of thumb, I try to stick to specific experiences that take an end-user 10 minutes or less to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are a few examples of these two study components for you to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital experience “chunk&amp;quot;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homepage experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New user signup flow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checkout flow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newsletter opt-in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Account creation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playlist creation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landing page experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;End-user group&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First-time visitors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guest shoppers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile visitors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desktop visitors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat visitors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users from a specific region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visitors from paid clicks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You may scope your studies incorrectly a few times. Don’t worry. With some practice this should become quite intuitive. For end-user groups, just make sure that each session in the study comes from a unique visitor. You want to avoid all of your sessions being from the same end-user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The portions of your site you choose to focus on first will depend on what kind of site (or app) you have, what your goals are, etc. Scoping your studies is the critical step to success with the Rule of Five. Meanwhile, the &lt;i&gt;ability&lt;/i&gt; to scope a study based on whatever digital experience and/or end-user group you want is why, even while you only need to replay five sessions, you need &lt;i&gt;all the sessions&lt;/i&gt; to ensure you can zero-in on what matters most for your research and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thankfully, by testing your digital experience in bite-size pieces, you never have to worry about spending too much time investigating any single thing and you can deftly avoid getting stuck in “analysis paralysis.” Using the Rule of Five makes it easy to test multiple iterations of a page or flow in quick succession or to simply move on to investigating something new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s cap things off by looking at an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Example: Optimize the checkout flow&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For an eCommerce company, there is arguably nothing more important than the checkout flow. As a result, this is often one of the first things people look to optimize using FullStory. In this example I will scope something a little more complex so you can get an idea of what it looks like to consider multiple user groups and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;My eComm company—we’ll call it CoffeeNet—sells mountains of beans across both desktop and mobile channels. Naturally, I am going to want to take this into account and watch sessions from both types of devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I also want to look at both first time shoppers and repeat shoppers to see if they experience the checkout flow differently. No UI should stand between my customers and their coffee!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, given these criteria, I would run four studies and watch five sessions for each of them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watching these 20 sessions will give me a good understanding of my major checkout-related usability issues. It will also provide insight into who, if anyone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;struggles&lt;/a&gt; the most with this process. Now, be careful not to overthink your process for collecting insights. A simple spreadsheet will do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After watching these 20 sessions, this is what I found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That’s it—High-five! 🙌&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Replaying sessions in FullStory is an amazing source of behavioral insights just waiting to be uncovered—and you don’t have to watch thousands of sessions to get at them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next time you want to learn more about how your new feature, page, flow, or form is treating your end-users, remember:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Scope your study and &lt;i&gt;just watch five&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;PS: Session replay is an amazing tool for seeing your site the way users see it. But the real power of FullStory is in the comprehensive, 360-degree intelligence we provide around digital experience, helping customers understand not only what is happening but why. &lt;a href=&quot;http://fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get a demo.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Seeing is believing: Generating screen captures from session recordings]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this post, you'll see how we used Puppeteer to bring thumbnails from proof-of-concept to production, and each aspect of the implementation. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/creating-screenshots-puppeteer-and-session-recording</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/creating-screenshots-puppeteer-and-session-recording</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Joshua Dutton]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2019 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Creating thumbnail &amp;quot;screenshots&amp;quot; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt; and Puppeteer.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Building the technology required to power a complex product like FullStory means routinely solving unique problems with non-routine solutions. Today, we’ll talk about one of these solutions—how we made it easy to identify specific moments from a user&amp;#x27;s digital experience by generating &lt;b&gt;thumbnails &lt;/b&gt;(a.k.a. screen captures or screenshots)&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;from their session, as logged by FullStory.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You might be thinking, &amp;quot;Screenshots from replaying sessions ... how hard could that be?&amp;quot; If so, that&amp;#x27;s a testament to the seamless experience of replaying user sessions in FullStory. This is because when you replay a user session in FullStory, even though what you&amp;#x27;re watching &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; like a video recording, it is really a complex re-enactment—like a play—of all the little things the user saw on screen (See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;Guide to Session Replay&lt;/a&gt;). In other words, generating a screenshot is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; like grabbing a frame from a video; it&amp;#x27;s more like conducting a play on demand and at a specific moment in time and then taking a photo of that exact moment, just how it happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That&amp;#x27;s far from easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So in this post, we&amp;#x27;ll cover how we brought thumbnails from proof-of-concept to production ready, walking you through each aspect of the implementation. You’ll get a sense for how real-life software is built, and in particular, how distributed systems come together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Passing Notes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A useful feature of FullStory is the ability to take notes and comment on sessions during replay. Here&amp;#x27;s how it works: Let’s say you’re watching a FullStory session and you notice something you don’t want to forget, so you make a comment. The &amp;quot;Note&amp;quot; gets attached to the session recording at a specific moment, and a link is generated directly to that Note in FullStory. Notes make it easy to collaborate within or across teams. You can share Notes with other users from within FullStory—or share them via integration with tools like JIRA and Slack. Within the FullStory app, you can review the “All Notes” page to quickly see all of the recent notes left by you and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Up until the beginning of 2019, Notes would show up as text-based cards in FullStory that included the name of whoever left the comment, a link to the corresponding moment in the recorded session, and more. This worked well enough, except for one thing: the Note cards were a little too abstract. They lacked a visualization of what the Note related to—a snapshot of the digital experience at the time of the comment. This made it hard to scan the notes quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We decided Notes needed screenshots, thumbnails to help the user see what the page looked like when the comment was created. And so we built thumbnails for FullStory Notes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you can see, thumbnails now appear above each of the Notes on the &amp;quot;All Notes&amp;quot; page. While the thumbnails are not earth-shattering, they add a certain je ne sais quoi to the page. 👌They make it easier than ever to quickly scan the page and find a Note that catches your eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Great. So how do thumbnails work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Master of Puppets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory’s session replay platform is, of course, a core component of the thumbnails implementation. By leveraging it, we can begin replaying a session, pause it at the right moment, and generate a screenshot. This screenshot can then be shrunk down and saved elsewhere to be used as the thumbnail. Done!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is a good idea. However, implementing it is more complicated than it seems. How do you convince an intern to sit and do this manually every time a Note is created? Obviously, you can&amp;#x27;t. And that&amp;#x27;s why we decided a humorless machine would have to shoulder the burden instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Enter the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer&quot;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/a&gt; library, built by the Google Chrome team. Puppeteer is a Node.js library that allows you to programmatically control headless instances of Google Chrome and its open-source cousin Chromium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you aren&amp;#x27;t familiar with the concept of a headless browser: it’s a fully functional web browser, but one that does not generally render the page to the screen or accept user input. Instead, it is controlled via an API by external tools. This means that it can navigate to pages, log-in, submit forms, execute Javascript, etc. It’s everything you&amp;#x27;d expect of a browser, maybe short of having extensions, bookmarks, or similar &amp;quot;quality of life&amp;quot; features. Typically, you encounter headless browsers in the context of automated user interface tests—such as through popular tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seleniumhq.org/&quot;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nightwatchjs.org/&quot;&gt;Nightwatch.js&lt;/a&gt;—which are able to manipulate headless browsers using a scripted series of steps to verify that your website’s functionality has not substantially regressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By leveraging Puppeteer and its ability to drive headless Chromium on our behalf, we had a way to power our session replay technology—and generate those moments we needed to screenshot—without having to perpetually caffeinate any humans. This solution could open and close the browser instance, navigate to the session replay page, and pipe the requisite data across the wire. Both spooky and useful, it could even support taking a screenshot of a page that it has not rendered out to the display! Just hit the right timestamp during playback and Puppeteer creates an image we can then buffer out to a file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Head in the Clouds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How does all of this play out in practice? Let’s look at some details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First, when a Note is first created inside the FullStory app, we place a message in a task queue. The message is just a small amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;data describing the session&lt;/a&gt;, such as display dimensions and resolution, and the point in time we&amp;#x27;d like Puppeteer to take the screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next, the message will be pulled from the queue by a task handler, which will validate the request and begin fetching the necessary event bundles for the page. (Event bundles are what drive session replay here at FullStory.) The bundles are sent alongside the rest of the request to a Google Cloud Function, which orchestrates the thumbnail creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here, the function navigates a fresh browser instance to the rendering iframe and injects the request parameters into the page:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;const handler = async (req: Request, res: Response) =&amp;gt; {
  const parameters: Parameters = { ... };
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  // exposeFunction adds a &amp;quot;bootstrap&amp;quot; function to the window object. It simply returns the parameters found
  // in the request body, including the event bundles, so that we can feed them to the rendering iframe.
  await page.exposeFunction(&amp;#x27;bootstrap&amp;#x27;, () =&amp;gt; parameters);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  // Navigate to the playback page, which will simulate session replay.
  page.goto(`file:${join(__dirname, &amp;#x27;headless_playback.html&amp;#x27;)}`);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  // Continued below.
};&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Inside the browser, the &lt;code&gt;headless_playback.html&lt;/code&gt; begins sending the event bundles over to the renderer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;// This script runs inside of the headless browser, not Node / GCF.
(async () =&amp;gt; {
  const parameters: Parameters = await window[&amp;#x27;bootstrap&amp;#x27;]();
  const [renderer, host, iframe] = openChannelToRenderer();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  // Point the playback iframe to the renderer
  const rendererUrl = buildRendererUrl(parameters);
  iframe.setAttribute(&amp;#x27;src&amp;#x27;, rendererUrl);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  renderer.playPage(parameters.page);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  await host.ready();
  renderer.playToTime(parameters.playToTime);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  // Signal to Puppeteer that rendering has begun
  iframe.style.visibility = &amp;#x27;visible&amp;#x27;;
})();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, at this point, our code is simulating session replay inside of a headless browser, purely for the purpose of extracting a thumbnail from the playback. Pretty cool! When rendering is finished, we can proceed to take the screenshot, do some quick resizing (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lovell/sharp&quot;&gt;sharp&lt;/a&gt;), and pipe the resulting image out through the response. Back in the request handler:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; // We&amp;#x27;re only interested in the contents of the renderer
 const boundingBox = await getBoundingBox(renderer);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; // Wait on Puppeteer to generate a screenshot of the page
 const screenshot = await page.screenshot({ clip: boundingBox });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; // Resize the image while maintaining aspect ratio. This should be sufficiently 
 // large for most use-cases while reducing storage costs and page load speeds.
 const resized = sharp(screenshot).resize({ width: 800, withoutEnlargement: true   }).toBuffer();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; return res.set(&amp;#x27;Content-Type&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;image/png&amp;#x27;).send(resized);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The task handler that sent the original request to the Google Cloud Function will then buffer the image out of the response into a file, where we can store it for use as a thumbnail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You Know What They Say About the Best Laid Plans ...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So far, the implementation is pretty solid. It just has one hurdle: we need to ensure the page is fully loaded and rendered before we proceed with the screenshot, rather than leaving it to guesswork. Otherwise the thumbnail could end up a garbled mess:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yep, that&amp;#x27;s it. White space and all. It goes without saying, this is not what the website looked like at the time in question.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Oof!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A simple solution to this problem would be to just wait a predetermined amount of time, say 5 seconds. But does this solution actually work? We recorded the network activity for a handful of websites out in the wild and compiled the data into the diagrams you see below. Each row represents an individual network request, moving from left to right through time, so rows stacked on top of one another indicate concurrent network requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above, you can see each network request made by the browser. For our purposes, we used this analysis to understand how long it takes to load a page. As you can see in this case, all requests were complete after about 3 seconds. You can pull these Gantt-like visualizations on your own by opening up the Developer Tools panel in your browser.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, in this first example, you can see the page initiates many requests simultaneously and they all finish relatively quickly. A+! The only drawback? Since we’re forced to wait the full 5 seconds, our code will continue to execute an additional (wasted) 2 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s take another example. Here, &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; of the requests finish with ample time to spare. Only if you look closely, there are two straggler requests who land past the 5 second mark. Our code would miss these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here, you can see almost all network requests are done after 3 seconds ... except if you look closely, there are a couple more that sneak in after 5 seconds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, look at these two pages. Both have requests that do not finish within our 5 second window ... and are lost. Hopefully those requests aren’t anything important like, say, a stylesheet or logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;These two last examples show how network requests can often drag out over many seconds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, two more pages whose requests do not finish within our 5 second window and are lost. Hopefully those requests aren’t anything important like, say, a stylesheet or logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We now know that for some pages, the 5 second cut-off will be too short. The resulting thumbnail could end up looking like an unstyled or partially loaded page. And for others, 5 seconds will be far too long, wasting time, money, and electricity on running code that has nothing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of course, 5 seconds is just an arbitrarily chosen cut-off. Adjusting it up or down does not fix either of our problems, so there really is no correct number here. &lt;i&gt;What were we to do?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Writing code that gets it right for every flavor of website out there is going to be very hard—and as every seasoned web developer knows, all we&amp;#x27;re trying to do here is cope. So here&amp;#x27;s how we coped: we gave the thumbnail function two heuristics: &lt;b&gt;network activity&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;rendering activity&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Holding the Door Open for Network Activity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you just saw, whenever the browser begins loading a modern webpage, it fires off a huge wave of requests in the background. It has to fetch all of the necessary fonts, stylesheets, scripts, images, and animations (the list goes on and on). As each of these requests finishes and the network activity “settles down,” we know the page is on its way to being presentable. So this “settling down” is our first indicator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Luckily, Puppeteer turns this vague concept of network activity “settling down” into a precise notion for us. It has a handful of &lt;code&gt;waitFor*&lt;/code&gt; functions, including &lt;code&gt;page.waitForNavigation([options])&lt;/code&gt;. This function takes a normal timeout as an option, and in addition it also accepts a &lt;code&gt;waitUntil&lt;/code&gt; parameter that can be any of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;load - consider navigation to be finished when the load event is fired.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;domcontentloaded - consider navigation to be finished when the DOMContentLoaded event is fired.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;networkidle0 - consider navigation to be finished when there are no more than 0 network connections for at least 500 ms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;networkidle2 - consider navigation to be finished when there are no more than 2 network connections for at least 500 ms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of the options above, we are interested in the bottom two since they give us a convenient way to measure network activity on the page. Thus, ideally, all of the network requests would finish quickly and Puppeteer would signal &lt;code&gt;networkidle0&lt;/code&gt; right away, allowing the screenshot to proceed. In practice some websites tend to have long-running but nonessential requests—or a recurring request that could prevent the &lt;code&gt;networkidle0&lt;/code&gt; condition from ever being satisfied. (These are the stragglers in example #2 above.) That leaves us with the more practical option—&lt;code&gt;networkidle2&lt;/code&gt;. If all but two requests have completed in a 500 millisecond window, we consider it good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What if those last two requests finish just outside the window? Catching the resources that load at the very last moment could make or break our thumbnail. This is that uncomfortable grey area you encounter when holding the door open for others. You should probably just let the door quietly shut, but you don’t. You insist on standing there with a half-hearted smile on your face as your victims do that awkward rush over to the door. This is that same dilemma, but in Javascript. Thankfully, it turns out we can reach a decent compromise without a lot of additional complexity using &lt;code&gt;Promise.race&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Proceed after either condition is reached. networkidle0 is preferable, but
// networkidle2 plus a small fudge factor is also acceptable.
const waitForNetworkIdle = async (page: Page): Promise&amp;lt;()&amp;gt; =&amp;gt; {
  const networkidle0 = async () =&amp;gt; {
    return page.waitForNavigation({ waitUntil: &amp;#x27;networkidle0&amp;#x27; });
  };&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  const networkidle2 = async () =&amp;gt; {
    await page.waitForNavigation({ waitUntil: &amp;#x27;networkidle2&amp;#x27; });
    return page.waitFor(1000);
  };&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  return Promise.race([
    networkidle0(),
    networkidle2(),
  ]);
};&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Promise.race&lt;/code&gt; accepts a list of promises. Whenever any of them resolve, no matter the order, &lt;code&gt;Promise.race&lt;/code&gt; will also resolve. If the page hits &lt;code&gt;networkidle0&lt;/code&gt; quickly, great! Otherwise, we&amp;#x27;re willing to hold the door open slightly longer for &lt;code&gt;networkidle2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rendering Activity&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The second indicator is rendering activity: as the page finishes loading and rendering to the (hypothetical) screen, there will be natural fluctuations in the amount of work the browser is doing. It will mostly be active, but there can be periods of inactivity or idling in between. We can queue up a function to be invoked during that browser idling using &lt;code&gt;window.requestIdleCallback&lt;/code&gt;, which takes a function as a callback and an optional timeout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Mind that &lt;code&gt;requestIdleCallback&lt;/code&gt; is not a standard browser function and will not be available everywhere. Notably, there is no support for &lt;code&gt;requestIdleCallback&lt;/code&gt; in Internet Explorer, Edge, or Safari. Since we&amp;#x27;re relying on Chromium for thumbnails, this is a safe choice, even though it&amp;#x27;s non-standard.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In practice, the browser may fire several idle callbacks throughout a typical page load. So only &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the page reaches network idle do we register the callback:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;const [idleState, renderer] = await Promise.all([
  waitForNetworkIdle(page),
  page.waitForSelector(&amp;#x27;#rendering-frame&amp;#x27;, { visible: true })
]);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Tell the browser-side code we&amp;#x27;re ready for the requestIdleCallback
// by invoking a custom function we placed on the window object
await page.evaluate(&amp;#x27;window.scheduleRequestIdleCallback()&amp;#x27;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over in the browser, on the &lt;code&gt;headless_play.html&lt;/code&gt; page:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Wait for the browser to signal that it is idle by using requestIdleCallback,
// or proceed after a short timeout if necessary
window[&amp;#x27;scheduleRequestIdleCallback&amp;#x27;] = () =&amp;gt; {
  const callback = () =&amp;gt; {
    window[&amp;#x27;onRequestIdle&amp;#x27;] = true;
  };&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  window[&amp;#x27;requestIdleCallback&amp;#x27;](callback, { timeout: 5000 });
};&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And back in the Cloud Function, &lt;code&gt;waitForFunction&lt;/code&gt; polls &lt;code&gt;onRequestIdle&lt;/code&gt; on the window object and waits for the condition to return true:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;// The network is idle and the rendering frame is visible; 
// just waiting on an idle callback from the browser
await page.waitForFunction(&amp;#x27;window.onRequestIdle&amp;#x27;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It may seem like a lot of work, but this extra effort helps ensure we produce good looking screenshots. If the browser is signaling that it is still working hard to render the page, either through network activity or delaying the idle callback, we&amp;#x27;re willing to wait around (up to a point, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Progress!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I See What You Did There: Visual Regression Testing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With our network and rendering heuristics in place, let’s talk about testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Constant change within a codebase will eventually lead to some broken features. To prevent these feature regressions from accidentally being shipped to the world, modern software engineering practices dictate your code is covered by a variety of automated tests, chiefly unit tests and integration tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thumbnails pose an additional challenge that cannot be easily tested by conventional methods: the code may advance from A to B to C without ever throwing an error even while generating a completely malformed thumbnail image! We need to reliably create thumbnails on-demand and at scale ... so we&amp;#x27;ll need a way to mitigate this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are a few possible approaches to consider, such as using traditional feature detection to reason about the quality of the image (e.g. by differentiating a blank webpage from one that is fully styled and rendered). Let&amp;#x27;s just cover one approach that has proven to work well in practice: &lt;b&gt;visual regression testing&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Visual regression testing uses a fuzzy image comparison algorithm to detect regressions in your code—typically changes in a program&amp;#x27;s user interface—that are very hard to notice with a normal test. To verify that the thumbnails implementation has not regressed due to any recent changes, we first generate a screenshot that has been checked by a human and certified as correct. This becomes what is known as the benchmark image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our benchmark image.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The benchmark image is committed to version control and lives alongside the rest of the code. Now, whenever any code is changed, the visual regression test will automatically run and check the output of the thumbnails function against the benchmark image. If the two differ beyond a low threshold, for instance a 1% difference, the test fails and the code changes are rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We perform this test using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot&quot;&gt;jest-image-snapshot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch&quot;&gt;pixelmatch&lt;/a&gt; libraries to perform the fuzzy image comparison:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;const toMatchImageSnapshot = configureToMatchImageSnapshot({
  failureThreshold: 0.01,
  failureThresholdType: &amp;#x27;percent&amp;#x27;,
  customSnapshotsDir: &amp;#x27;__image_snapshots__&amp;#x27;,
  updatePassedSnapshot: true,
});&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;expect.extend({ toMatchImageSnapshot });&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;test(&amp;#x27;visual regression&amp;#x27;, async () =&amp;gt; {
  const requestBody = JSON.stringify(testFixture);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  return request(app)
    .post(&amp;#x27;/thumbnails&amp;#x27;)
    .send(requestBody)
    .expect(200)
    .expect(&amp;#x27;Content-Type&amp;#x27;, &amp;#x27;image/png&amp;#x27;)
    .then(res =&amp;gt; expect(res.body).toMatchImageSnapshot());
}, 30000);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What does it look like when this test fails? Imagine a bug prevents one of the images from loading inside your session playback. The difference between the two thumbnails is enough to cross the threshold and cause the test to fail. When this happens, the pixelmatch library produces a helpful image diff to aid in troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Above you can see the output of our visual regression test. The test compares the benchmark image (left) to the screen from the session recording (right), identifying any difference (middle image).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Without the visual regression test, this change may have passed through the continuous integration pipeline and made it into production, where it could have gone unnoticed for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Automated testing such as this visual regression check help give us confidence that the thumbnail feature works and will continue to work into the future, even as the codebase and the product rapidly evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Thumbs Up!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And that&amp;#x27;s how thumbnails for FullStory are created. The interns are saved!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of course, even with all the above going on, there’s still more happening behind the scenes than what could be covered here—things like securing, deploying, and monitoring the thumbnails code. There&amp;#x27;s a lot that goes into making FullStory the product it is. Thumbnails may seem a small thing, but little things add up to make for big differences in the overall experience of a digital product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I hope this small slice provides a “snapshot” into how a feature is built and implemented here at FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;P.S.&lt;/b&gt; We’re incredibly proud of the work we do, and want to share our love for engineering with the world. FullStory is constantly on the lookout for others who share our enthusiasm for finding creative solutions to exceptionally challenging software problems.

You check it every single day—maybe even every hour—to see what your friends are up to, send messages, or check what&amp;#x27;s trending in the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Maybe it&amp;#x27;s just to check the weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your app has a similar group of powers users—people who regularly check in, are always looking to discover something new, get the latest info, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They use every part of your product and know it backwards and forwards. This makes them real-life knowledge databases. Not only do they know more about your product than your average user, they very well may know it better than &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What makes power users tick? How do regular users turn into power users? If you can understand &lt;b&gt;why&lt;/b&gt; power users become so engaged, you can use this insight help the average user, improving the product&amp;#x27;s value proposition, retention, driving growth, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Start by finding your power users.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Power users by definition use your product all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because they use your product so frequently, they understand what it&amp;#x27;s supposed to do for them. They know where to find features and how to adapt them to their specific needs. All of this work and patience makes power users valuable resources not only as long-lived customers, but as reservoirs of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of course, before you can learn from them, you have to know who they are. Below are common ways to identify your power users:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They&amp;#x27;re &amp;quot;regulars&amp;quot;—repeat users.&lt;/b&gt; One of your core metrics is probably DAU. Power users are usually the ones with the most visits under their belt. It&amp;#x27;s easy to spot regulars in FullStory (more on that below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They&amp;#x27;re vocal and share insights and feedback regularly.&lt;/b&gt; For example, they may reach out on social media or forums to talk about your product, offer ideas for new features, or share bugs they&amp;#x27;ve encountered. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Quora—all of these places are likely to contain public chatter. Google around and take notes on your findings. They are also likely to reach out over your support channels with ideas, feedback, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They&amp;#x27;re influential.&lt;/b&gt; Power users leave frequent, well thought-out comments about your product and have backgrounds that give their comments credibility. Other users are more likely to listen to them and trust what they have to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They&amp;#x27;re active early adopters.&lt;/b&gt; Launching MVPs is the norm these days. Power users are the ones who&amp;#x27;ll not only download a new app just because it&amp;#x27;s there, but use it consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While there&amp;#x27;s much to learn about power users &amp;quot;in the wild&amp;quot;—when they&amp;#x27;re talking about your product to others—the most surefire way to find them and learn from them is through observing how they use your site or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That&amp;#x27;s where FullStory search and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt; come in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Identifying your power users in FullStory.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are many ways to identify your power users in FullStory; however, we have a couple suggestions to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Top Users list card.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &amp;quot;came with the frame&amp;quot; solution is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/login&quot;&gt;login to FullStory&lt;/a&gt; and scroll down below your list of recent sessions and find &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/insights-on-the-top-users-for-your-web-site-or-app/&quot;&gt;the &lt;i&gt;Top Users&lt;/i&gt; card&lt;/a&gt;. This shows you top users based on total sessions logged. The list gives you a snapshot of who&amp;#x27;s most active in your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can refine the &lt;i&gt;Top Users&lt;/i&gt; list through filtering your sessions by whatever additional criteria you like.&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/learn-from-power-users-and-improve-your-product/#fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; This list is a great place to start your Top Users research. If there are specific identified users (e.g. you are using &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.fullstory.com/develop-js/identify&quot;&gt;fs.identify&lt;/a&gt;) you find particularly noteworthy, write down their ID. You could &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;create a segment in FullStory&lt;/a&gt; based off these IDs for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Create a Power Users segment.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The second option is to create a search in FullStory for your users who have reached a certain threshold of activity. For example, at FullStory, we have a &amp;quot;Power Users&amp;quot; segment. The search criteria for this segment are simple:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show me all the users with &lt;i&gt;greater than 100 sessions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exclude &lt;/i&gt;any users with @fullstory email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exclude &lt;/i&gt;any users with our IP address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you just created that segment, go ahead and save it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having created a Power Users segment in FullStory, you&amp;#x27;ll immediately get some juicy stats on them. For example, a cursory look at our Power Users segment in contrast to &amp;quot;Everyone&amp;quot; tells us that our set of &amp;quot;Power Users&amp;quot; represent 4% of our total but &lt;i&gt;40% of sessions&lt;/i&gt;. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When we run some quick numbers on the Average User Session stats card (read more about that &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/average-user-session-stats-by-segment/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), we further validate that our power users just do more all around:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pretty cool, right? But this is just the beginning of what we can learn about power users, and now that you&amp;#x27;ve identified them, you&amp;#x27;re ready to take the next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Learn from them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Power users reveal the path to your product&amp;#x27;s value.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Power users put in the time to climb the learning curve of your product. As a result, they know how to navigate your product efficiently. What&amp;#x27;s more, they are willing to dig around, tinker, and experiment to learn more. There is a very good chance they know your product in a way that you—on the inside of the product—may never quite understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can learn a lot from power users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you identify them, spend some time watching what your top users are doing—using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt;. Think of their interactions as well-worn &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-are-desire-paths-and-how-use-desire-paths-for-design-and-development/&quot;&gt;desire paths that imply intention and purpose&lt;/a&gt;. Getting an understanding of these paths will create opportunities. So take notes on their behavior and pay attention to things like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do they do first when logging in? &lt;/b&gt;The details matter. Remember: your top users are going to be more efficient at navigating your product, so there is very likely a clear purpose in their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What features do they use the most? &lt;/b&gt;If there&amp;#x27;s a specific feature you want to track interaction with, you could creatively search in FullStory for interactions with that part of your product and see if any of your Top Users are taking advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How long is their typical session? &lt;/b&gt;Are they typically in and out over and over again? Or do they tend to have marathon sessions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are there common patterns to their sessions? &lt;/b&gt;We are creatures of habit—power users are no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What features are they &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;using? &lt;/b&gt;We may be in love with our latest snazzy feature, but are the power users actually using it? What features are they not using?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the Job to Be Done? &lt;/b&gt;Try and tease out what it is—the task—they&amp;#x27;re looking to accomplish. What is the?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You might be surprised by what you find, but you can take what you learn from your research here and optimize which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.appcues.com/blog/user-onboarding-best-practices/&quot;&gt;features to emphasize during onboarding&lt;/a&gt;—the goal is to take that value and make it accessible to all of your users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you can &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-are-desire-paths-and-how-use-desire-paths-for-design-and-development/&quot;&gt;pave the path&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; for all your users and help them extract more value out of your product, your product will be all the more successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Caveat!&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;An important caveat: your power users are a special group of users who are likely the kind of people who &lt;i&gt;always do more&lt;/i&gt; when it comes to how they use any given site or app. They have a temperament and a tolerance that your average user may not possess. Therefore, while you&amp;#x27;re observing power users&amp;#x27; behaviors, it&amp;#x27;s important to remember not to take everything they suggest at face value. They may have a lot of feedback to offer, but they want you to build a product that meets their needs, which may not be the needs of your whole customer base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The last thing you want is a product they love but average users don&amp;#x27;t understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You still want to help the power users as much as you can, so if there&amp;#x27;s a feature that your power users are begging for, consider if you could build it with enough flexibility to make it useful for average users &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; power users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Give your users the power of appreciation!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Not only are your power users treasure troves of knowledge about your product, they&amp;#x27;re also hugely invested in what you&amp;#x27;ve built. They may even feel that your product is a part of their identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, have you ever talked to someone who a master at Excel? If you haven&amp;#x27;t, find one. Then, pour yourself a cup of tea, find a nice couch, and get them talking about how they use hotkeys, alt+ menu shortcuts, pivot tables, &lt;code&gt;INDEX&lt;/code&gt; functions, and on and on. You&amp;#x27;ll soon be lulled to sleep as they tell you about how to &lt;code&gt;Paste Special ➡ Values&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Commence power nap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Give your power users something back for their hard work. Recognize their dedication to your product. Incentivize your more average users to become power users. Here are a few suggestions to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get testimonials from power users and share them with all of your users via email or social media.&lt;/b&gt; Rather than hearing how great your product is from you, which is a lot like hearing a parent glow over their children, let your power users do the talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/love&quot;&gt;Share their tweets&lt;/a&gt;. Ask power users to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/use-cases&quot;&gt;share their stories&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;#x27;ll be happy to share and your other users will benefit from hearing their knowledge.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Send personalized messages when new users hit certain milestones.&lt;/b&gt; Ever considered reaching out directly to your identified power users? &amp;quot;Hey, we appreciate your dedication to our product! We wanted to show that appreciation by shooting you some swag if you were interested.&amp;quot; 

Since you&amp;#x27;ve already identified your power users (above) using FullStory, if you have their contact information as part of your user identification, the hard work is already done. Simply export a list, craft an email, and show some appreciation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create in-app messaging that rewards power users. &lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot;Achievement unlocked.&amp;quot; Who doesn&amp;#x27;t like being recognized? Who doesn&amp;#x27;t like getting a quick high-✋ when you did something cool? Little rewards work, so why not build them into your product?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I have the power!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you gain fresh insight from your data, it opens the door to new questions. As you have new questions, you need to update your instrumentation and analysis. Saying the process is “done” is saying you understand every thing there is to know about your users, product, and channels. -&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.interana.com/blog/61-analytics-quotes-experts&quot;&gt;Brian Balfour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keeping tabs on your power users is critical—both from a learning standpoint &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; also by knowing when your power &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/#sources-of-frustration-online&quot;&gt;users may be getting frustrated&lt;/a&gt;.

There are a variety of options out there—you can build a tool in-house or use a purpose-built product experience platform (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gainsight.com/product-experience/&quot;&gt;may we suggest, Gainsight PX?&lt;/a&gt;) to build and launch your engagements. No matter what, you want your technology to empower teams to personalize these in-app experiences, analyze the results, and do it quickly without a lot of overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Remember: the purpose of in-app engagements is to create a personalized experience that benefits your users. So make sure your solution allows you to target users based on qualities like user activity, the account they roll up to, and their job roles/titles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You might not get your in-app engagement right the first time, but that’s okay! We’re all in the business of experimenting or iterating, but if you want to do it right you need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever tech you chose should also have capabilities to track engagement performance. You can even pair your in-app engagement solution with a platform like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt; to understand how users interact with your engagements through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/features/#Replay&quot;&gt;replay&lt;/a&gt;. This can reveal &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/&quot;&gt;points of friction and frustration&lt;/a&gt; so you can optimize placement, timing, and frequency of appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can move much faster if your technology allows you to build in-app engagements without coding knowledge—this avoids the need to involve other departments for each engagement your team needs. “Involve other departments,” you say, “but won’t that mean that everybody will constantly be messaging our users and hurt our customer experience?”—not if you have a comprehensive in-app engagement strategy. That&amp;#x27;s why you need a framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Framework for In-App Engagements You Can &amp;quot;TRUSt&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By using a consistent &lt;b&gt;framework&lt;/b&gt; for evaluating in-app communications, you increase the likelihood that these types of communications are highly valued—even welcomed. A consistent framework also prevents users from getting message fatigue. In-app communications aren’t the same as email—they’re highly-targeted forms of communication intended to rise above the noise of a common inbox. Exercising care in how they are used is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At Gainsight, we use &amp;quot;The TRUSt framework&amp;quot; to evaluate which customer communications should be delivered in-app, via email, or in-person—and when to trigger them. &amp;quot;TRUSt&amp;quot; stands for &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;imely, &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;elevant, &lt;b&gt;U&lt;/b&gt;seful, &lt;b&gt;St&lt;/b&gt;raightforward, and the TRUSt framework works to make sure that all in-app engagements are TRUSt-worthy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Timely&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We should present engagements based on the user’s timing instead of ours. For example, you should not introduce in-app guides for advanced and sophisticated functionality on a user’s first login. This is because it’s too early. By comparison, if you present an in-app survey months after the user finished a task, then it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Relevant&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We should trigger engagements depending on clear use (or lack thereof) of our product. For example, if there are users that only use Feature A, don’t send them notifications about Feature B, C, or D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Useful&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Engagements need to help users in one way or another. A useful in-app engagement will help a user complete a task faster or learn something new—e.g. how to use a new feature correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Straightforward&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Engagements should be as unobtrusive as possible. Your users log in with a goal in mind so the more concise your message is, the quicker they can return to their original task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you devise your personal engagement strategy, it’s vital that you clearly define what makes an engagement “helpful.” What is the outcome you hope to achieve? The TRUSt Framework ensures all in-app communications have a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;That&amp;#x27;s it.&lt;/i&gt; Running through the TRUSt framework will bring rigor to how you think about in-app communications, ensuring you’re keeping the customer’s digital experience front and center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now let&amp;#x27;s take a look at how the TRUSt framework can&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; be applied in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The TRUSt Framework: A Practical Application&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At Gainsight, we recently released our new Gainsight Mobile Application, which makes certain features from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gainsight.com/customer-success/&quot;&gt;Gainsight CS&lt;/a&gt; platform available &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;for Customer Success Managers (CSMs) on-the-go. As you’d expect, we turned to in-app engagements to drive awareness and target the users that would get the most out of this new development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s how we applied The TRUSt Framew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;ork to ensure these in-app engagements were a success, starting with the first message our users saw in-app:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Timely&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To ensure we sent this message on our user’s time and not just ours, we only triggered the message when someone entered our Timeline feature (more on the relevance of this below). We could’ve made the message pop up upon login, but we all know that if you’re logging in with a mission, you’ll be quick to dismiss these pop-ups. Notifications can easily disrupt the user experience so aligning them to the user workflow can make them less jarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Relevant&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Relevance was a huge consideration in our mobile app launch strategy. To decide which users to target, we focused on user activity. A key benefit of Gainsight’s Mobile App is that users can access the full functionality of our Timeline feature on their mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We deduced that customers that regularly use Timeline on our desktop application were likely interested in accessing Timeline in our mobile app (simple enough, right?). So, we triggered the message to appear to our end users when they were using the Gainsight CS Timeline feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Useful&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This particular engagement informed users of the new mobile app. The Gainsight Mobile App was a highly-anticipated development, so we made the call to action button lead our audience straight to the app store so they could download the app ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Straightforward&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s important that your in-app engagements match your application visually. Otherwise, people might mistake it as a third-party advertisement! You can see in the close-up below that we used our brand colors and concise messaging to convey our point quickly and clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because we provided the content to our users in the right place, at the right time, we got 1.5x more click-throughs to download the app than through our email outreach. In less than two weeks we were able to increase mobile app downloads by 110%!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’d like to learn more about this use case for in-app engagements, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gainsight.com/blog/how-to-create-targeted-in-app-messages-with-gainsight-px/&quot;&gt;dive deeper into the thought and execution processes on our blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Create Meaningful Engagement With Your Users&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In-app engagements are the future of customer communications and, like any new frontier, there’s still much to be explored.

But first, I have to introduce Grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and a pioneer in the world of computer programming. She worked on one of the first computers and changed the game by popularizing the idea of machine-independent programming languages. Basically, she was an all-around &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper&quot;&gt;superstar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Grace Hopper also happened to be a woman, making her a pioneer in more ways than one. But almost 30 years after Hopper’s death, women are &lt;i&gt;still &lt;/i&gt;highly underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics, women in the United States represent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commerce.gov/news/reports/2017/11/women-stem-2017-update&quot;&gt;less than a quarter (24%)&lt;/a&gt; of those employed in STEM occupations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a mission to inspire, motivate, and move more women in technology, AnitaB.org hosts the annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghc.anitab.org/&quot;&gt;Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing&lt;/a&gt;. The event brings together women technologists from around the world; this year, several of FullStory’s women technical leaders were in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we are grateful to have many brilliant women on our team. Women who work tirelessly to build a product we can all be proud of. With Grace Hopper top-of-mind, we wanted to spotlight four of our women techstars—these are their stories. They inspire us daily and we hope their experiences, lessons, and voices inspire you too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Stephanie Brubaker, Director of Engineering and Founding Engineer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tell us a bit about yourself.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve always been a hopeless nerd, loving puzzles and math and any kind of problem to be solved. I went to Swarthmore (a liberal arts school) as an undergrad and Georgia Tech (pretty much the opposite) as a graduate student. I&amp;#x27;ll make up any excuse to do a soldering project, and the results are mostly successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What made you decide to work at FullStory?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I joined FullStory as employee number five, back when we had no product and no revenue. There&amp;#x27;s no better way to learn how to get a product off the ground than to actually try it, and I looked at this as another form of education. Even if we didn&amp;#x27;t make it, I would have learned a great deal about the process of building a company. What made me choose FullStory over other Atlanta startups was my trust in the talent and ethics of the founding team. I had worked with several of the members before at Google and knew that they were the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What have been some of your career highlights at FullStory so far?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve gotten to see a lot of milestones at FullStory, but one highlight was shipping the version of FullStory that we refer to as FS4. It was a major update to both the underlying technology and the user interface, so a lot of pieces had to line up for a successful launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It was right before Thanksgiving and we were moving offices, and it just so happened that our launch date fell during the time when we didn&amp;#x27;t actually have office space. In typical scrappy start-up fashion, we made a command center in Bruce&amp;#x27;s (Bruce Johnson, FullStory Founder and Chief Product Officer) basement with a bunch of couches and card tables and coordinated the release from there. It went off without a hitch!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What were your highlights from attending Grace Hopper?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hands down the best part of Grace Hopper was the Leadership Summit. Listening to advice from women who lead companies in all stages of growth was really powerful and gave me a lot to think about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s a mistake you made early in your career that you learned a lot from?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I had a job early on that I really didn&amp;#x27;t like, and I&amp;#x27;ve always felt that I should have moved on sooner. However, I still use so many of the lessons (good and bad) that I learned in that role, so I really don&amp;#x27;t think there&amp;#x27;s such a thing as wasted time. I do think, though, that the most common mistake is not asking enough questions. Humbling yourself and asking questions is the cure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2008/05/overcoming-imposter-syndrome&quot;&gt;Imposter Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; because you quickly learn more and gain confidence, and it&amp;#x27;s really important to learn from those around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What book(s) are you currently reading?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I tend to read a lot of mystery novels, but when I feel up for non-fiction, I usually choose autobiographies. Two that I&amp;#x27;ve enjoyed recently are &lt;i&gt;Hillbilly Elegy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/i&gt;. I also enjoyed the non-fiction book &lt;i&gt;Evicted&lt;/i&gt;. My favorite books are about real people and the struggles that they&amp;#x27;re facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Agata Bugaj, Head of Product Management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tell us a bit about yourself.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I currently lead the Product Management team at FullStory. Prior to that, I worked in product management at The Home Depot, did management consulting at Bain &amp;amp; Co, and engineering at IBM. I got my undergrad in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University and my MBA from the University of Michigan. I’m originally from Poland, but have lived all over. I’m the mom of two very loud, energetic, and incredible little boys. My happy place would have to be somewhere hiking in the woods, reading a book in peace and quiet, or cooking and baking with the kiddos! Oh, and travel. I love to travel. If there&amp;#x27;s a passport involved, count me in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What made you decide to work at FullStory?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Two key reasons: the product and the people. I was a user of analytics tools in my past life, and I felt that FullStory had absolutely nailed many of the pain points that I experienced. I was excited about the quality of the product and the potential for its evolution. Additionally, I was so impressed with every person I met during my interviews. I get to work with an incredible group of design and engineering practitioners: people who not only excel at their craft, but are driven, creative, customer-centric, and have a bias for action. It&amp;#x27;s such an inspiring group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What have been some of your career highlights at FullStory so far?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We recently launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/conversions-by-fullstory/&quot;&gt;Conversions&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#x27;m incredibly proud of how this product came to life. It was 100% rooted in customer need and developed at every step along the way with customers at our side. We had an empowered, cross-functional product team that had a clear mission. We were able to take best practices in product development to get the product where it needed to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When I look back at the beginning and our hypotheses about what we were building, and ultimately what we shipped (of course will continue to evolve!), it&amp;#x27;s a true testament to the importance of research, prototyping with customers, and being able to say, &amp;quot;Welp, that hypothesis proved false.&amp;quot; We deprioritized work we initially thought was important, and brought in other arcs that we didn&amp;#x27;t think mattered to customers. Now that the product is in the wild, we&amp;#x27;re continuing the journey and developing based on customer need. Not only am I proud of our team for what we built, but even more excited about what&amp;#x27;s next!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What were your highlights from attending Grace Hopper?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I had the opportunity to attend Grace Hopper in 2002 when it was a conference for about 600 attendees. This year there were over 20,000 attendees, so it was exciting to see the growth and momentum of the organization. Also, the connections I made, whether if it was with folks from FullStory or other places, were all incredibly meaningful to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Admiral Grace Hopper is a hero to many. Who are your heroes?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Marty Cagan: When it comes to Product Management thought leadership and defining this practice, Marty is it. Hands down. I have found his teachings to be instrumental in helping me develop as a practitioner as well as lead and coach others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Grant Achatz: I&amp;#x27;ve always been amazed by his culinary genius. But more importantly, what he went through with stage 4 cancer, a disease that could have left him with (best case scenario) the inability to taste, and how he overcame all of that while continuing to be one of the best chefs in the world. It blows my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;My grandfather: feels like that one&amp;#x27;s obvious. 😉&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s a mistake you made early in your career that you learned a lot from?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the beginning of my career, one of my former managers once said to me, &amp;quot;If you do the things I&amp;#x27;m asking you to do, I&amp;#x27;m paying you way too much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At first I didn&amp;#x27;t get it. I interpreted this as, &amp;quot;Am I not supposed to listen to my boss?&amp;quot; But really, what he meant was, &amp;quot;I need you to use the thought leadership skills that I hired you for. I don&amp;#x27;t have all the answers, but I expect you to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The point is every one of us is hired for a reason. We have a set of skills, experiences, and perspectives. We need everyone to bring that to work with them everyday. Yes, there&amp;#x27;s a role that leadership and management play, but, ultimately, you&amp;#x27;re closer to the work that you&amp;#x27;re doing. You know more about that arc than anyone else does. Your boss is operating on the inputs that they have, but so are you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You should feel comfortable challenging and asking questions, influencing upwards, and pushing back if something doesn&amp;#x27;t make sense. We (and especially PMs) are not order takers. By definition, we can&amp;#x27;t be even if we wanted to be. So it&amp;#x27;s critical that we take all of the inputs, regardless of where they&amp;#x27;re coming from, ask questions, debate, be open to being wrong, and ultimately have a perspective on the right course of action. Then we need to figure out how to bring everyone else along, whether that&amp;#x27;s our boss, partner, or stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What book(s) are you currently reading?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I just finished reading &lt;i&gt;High Growth Handbook&lt;/i&gt; by Elad Gil. It’s such a great read, especially given where we are at FullStory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Jessica Greenfield, Tech Lead and Software Engineering Manager&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tell us a bit about yourself.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I am a backend engineer who started out with C programming at age 10. My dad handed me a book on C and said something like, &amp;quot;I think you should learn this”—then left me to it. But I didn&amp;#x27;t love programming until my 8th grade basic class, where I used my spare time to build a text-based battleship game. I realized that pretty much anything you can imagine, with programming you can build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After getting a degree in Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech and working for a few years, I headed off to China for two years to teach English and travel. I met my husband there and dragged him back to the United States. I then got a master&amp;#x27;s degree in Chinese just for the love of the subject before finally returning to the world of IT. I like to knit and heckle my kids and husband, who happily heckle me right back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What made you decide to work at FullStory?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I had worked with Bruce and Joel Webber (FullStory Founders) at a startup called AppForge in the early 2000s. We went our separate ways until mid-2017, when I happened to be feeling like I had plateaued in my current position. Bruce randomly pinged me on LinkedIn, and I was like, &amp;quot;Bruce, omg I wonder what HE&amp;#x27;s doing now?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I read through the FullStory website and blog posts and liked what I saw. Then I applied and came in for an interview. I walked away from the interview thinking I had completely failed, but was so grateful for having had the chance to talk to four really smart people whom I would be eternally grateful to work with. But I got the job!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;TL;DR: I guess you could say it&amp;#x27;s the people at FullStory that made me want to join and stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What have been some of your career highlights at FullStory so far?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I&amp;#x27;m very lucky to have been part of building our webhooks platform (more information on this coming soon!). I feel like it&amp;#x27;s going to drive a lot of value for FullStory and for the upcoming integrations that we and our customers want to build. I&amp;#x27;ll be focusing on integrations next, trying to dive into deeper use cases and help nail down what our integration strategy looks like for the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What were your highlights from attending Grace Hopper?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been to many technical conferences in my career, but this was my first Grace Hopper. The highlight for me was just seeing so many women technologists together in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I had a moment on the first day where I just stopped walking for a second because I was emotionally overwhelmed. I&amp;#x27;ve spent most of my career being the only woman in the room, sometimes even in the building. We still have a long way to go, but seeing this community and the women who were building gave me a rare moment of pure joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Admiral Grace Hopper is a hero to many. Who are your heroes?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve never really had heroes in the sense that there was someone who made me consciously say, &amp;quot;I want to be like this person.&amp;quot; I admire my mother&amp;#x27;s grit and persistence; once she decides she&amp;#x27;s going to do something, nothing gets in her way. She removes obstacles with grace and a complete lack of drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;My aunt has had a subtle but lifelong influence on me. She made it feel like it was normal to pursue my interest in math and science despite being a girl. She was a biologist, and I grew up being regaled at Christmas with tales of life in the field, from checking toxin levels in freshwater fish to working with wild boars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s a mistake you made early in your career that you learned a lot from?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I didn&amp;#x27;t do enough introspection; I didn&amp;#x27;t spend enough time putting events in context and making sure that I learned all I could from them. I focused on my knowledge and technical skills, but understanding people, workplace dynamics, and yourself is just as important to being a successful engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What book(s) are you currently reading?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I&amp;#x27;m about to start reading &lt;i&gt;Mythos&lt;/i&gt; by Stephen Fry, which is a retelling of Greek mythology told as only Stephen Fry can tell it. I read a collection of Greek myths for the first time in fourth grade, and have always loved various retellings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lisa Su, Data Scientist &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tell us a bit about yourself.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’m Yi-Hsuan, but everyone knows me as Lisa. I’m originally from Taiwan and have lived in Atlanta for four years. I’m a data scientist at FullStory. Before FullStory, I worked at General Electric as a senior data scientist. Outside of FullStory, I enjoy traveling and eating the local dishes, with my favorite being the Thai skewered meat from the street vendors in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fun fact: I’m told I’m exceptionally great at catching baseballs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What made you decide to work at FullStory?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The fascinating, cutting-edge product and exceptionally bright people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What have been some of your career highlights at FullStory so far?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’ve really enjoyed developing an intelligent detector for customer experience frustration. “Intelligent detector” means that we’re using data driven approach to measure the customer experience and proactively surfacing sessions with frustration signals to FullStory users. The goal of creating the intelligent detector is to deliver actionable insights to our users before they ask for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What were your highlights from attending Grace Hopper?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One of the more memorable highlights was hearing the inspiring stories from women who have been in tech for years and are now industry leaders. Many offered insightful perspectives from their own industry advancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Admiral Grace Hopper is a hero to many. Who are your heroes?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s President, Tsai Ing-wen, and former President Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Also, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates for recent advances in tech and world philanthropy, along with money management and life advice. I also admire Elon Musk for his forward-looking perspectives and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s a mistake you made early in your career that you learned a lot from?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Early on, I feel that I did not communicate with my stakeholders as much as I could have. I felt afraid to ask questions, worried that I was taking up too much of their time. But in the end, I didn’t deliver the right product. That was a huge lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If I’d asked questions, our product drafts could have been better tailored to stakeholder specifications—&lt;i&gt;what they actually wanted&lt;/i&gt;—earlier on, saving everyone time. I would advise others early in their career to not be afraid to communicate as often as needed because guessing a stakeholder’s desires is ultimately an exercise in futility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What book(s) are you currently reading?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Classic nonfiction: &lt;i&gt;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&lt;/i&gt; by Covey.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Improve your digital experience with Qualtrics and FullStory]]></title><description><![CDATA[FullStory’s partnership with Qualtrics makes it easy for companies to combine qualitative customer feedback with robust, digital experience data. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualtrics-and-fullstory</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualtrics-and-fullstory</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Amy Ellis]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, we are excited to announce that FullStory is joining the Qualtrics Partner Network. Now you can connect the valuable customer feedback you get from Qualtrics with your digital experience data in FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With these technologies combined, it’s never been easier to understand the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; behind customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Build a big picture of your customer’s digital experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No matter how many data points you collect, it’s confoundingly hard to understand what the online experience really feels like for users and customers on your site or app. And without this knowledge, it’s nearly impossible to identify and prioritize opportunities to improve that experience—and your bottom-line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For product managers, one of the hardest problems can be reconciling qualitative feedback you get from customers with big picture quantitative analysis. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is one person’s negative Net Promoter Score (NPS) score correlated with an overall reduction in conversions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is a negative survey response indicative of your overall digital experience … or simply an outlier?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the digital experience like for your most enthusiastic respondents?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory and Qualtrics come together to answer these kinds of questions, giving you a holistic view of your customer’s online experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s how the Qualtrics + FullStory integration works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Connecting Qualtrics with FullStory enables you to search and segment your digital experience data based on custom events like &lt;code&gt;Qualtrics Survey Submitted&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Completed NPS.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What can you do with all this data? Imagine the possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantify the impact of a negative survey response and determine the prevalence of an issue uncovered through customer feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch what your digital experience is really like for customers leaving negative feedback (or positive feedback)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; to understand if lower NPS scores correlate with lower conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get notified anytime a customer gives you a low NPS and immediately jump into FullStory to troubleshoot the issues they&amp;#x27;re facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We already know there is great power in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/nps-surveys-fullstory/&quot;&gt;combining NPS scores with digital experience data from FullStory&lt;/a&gt;—so what are you waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let feedback fuel the digital experience fire&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This partnership is only the beginning and we’re excited to continue building solutions for product managers with Qualtrics.

For product and customer experience teams, the insights, issues, and ideas gleaned from customer feedback are priceless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medallia.com/&quot;&gt;Medallia&lt;/a&gt;. Medallia is the feedback backbone for many of the world’s top brands; their Experience Cloud makes it easy to monitor feedback across a multitude of sources from online reviews, chat logs, and surveys, to net promoter scores (NPS), click streams and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While user feedback answers many questions, it often inspires even more questions—questions like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &amp;quot;How are these low NPS scores affecting our conversion rates?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &amp;quot;Which issues will have the biggest impact on our bottom line so we can prioritize the most important fixes first?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &amp;quot;Are there any commonalities in the experiences of our happy customers versus our unhappy ones?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &amp;quot;How can the same product/online store lead to thousands of happy shoppers AND frustrated detractors?

That’s where FullStory comes in. When you pair FullStory with Medallia, you can instantly see the context behind every piece of feedback received from a customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory stores and organizes customer interactions on your site or mobile app, allowing you to see exactly what happened for any given customer session.

Understand the business impact of a bad digital experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &amp;quot;How are these low NPS scores affecting our conversion rates?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve heard from mutual customers that one of the most exciting aspects of our partnership with Medallia is the ability to understand the impact of negative feedback on conversion rates. Finally, product and CX teams can quantify the impact of issues illuminated by customer feedback, identify solutions, and prioritize efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How does this work? Using the Medallia and FullStory integration, your feedback metrics (e.g. survey data and NPS scores) flow directly into FullStory, connecting them to FullStory’s treasure trove of digital experience data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Then, from FullStory, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;search, segment,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/graph-monthly-weekly-and-daily-active-user-trends-by-behavior-user-attribute/&quot;&gt;view trends&lt;/a&gt; associated with those metrics. And if you’re a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/conversions/&quot;&gt;Conversions by FullStory&lt;/a&gt; user, you can find where frustrating customer experiences result in not only poor feedback but also underperforming conversion rates (and by how much).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you heard about our Conversions product? With Conversions by FullStory, you get a prioritized list of opportunities—all ranked by impact. Watch this video (1:50) to learn more.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you&amp;#x27;re able to connect digital customer feedback—like NPS scores—with the digital experience that led to it, you&amp;#x27;ll have &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/nps-surveys-fullstory/&quot;&gt;exactly what you need&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;What&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Why&lt;/i&gt; to make those customer experiences better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Find the common denominator among your detractors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;— &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Are there any differences in the experiences of our happy customers compared to our unhappy ones?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;— &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;How can the same product—or online store—lead to thousands of happy shoppers AND frustrated detractors?

That means once you bring Medallia’s Experience Cloud data into FullStory, you can get a high level view of the activity trends of your happiest customers compared to your most frustrated ones. Does one group take a different path through your site than another? What do the differences tell you about how you can improve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Imagine, you discover that your happiest customers—as revealed by Medallia—all visit the homepage of your site at some point during their shopping experience. Meanwhile, your less satisfied shoppers arrive by way of search and proceed straight to checkout. Both are completing their purchase but something doesn’t add up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using Engagement Heatmaps and Click Maps in FullStory, you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-are-web-heatmaps-how-do-they-work-pros-cons-alternatives/&quot;&gt;heatmap of users on the homepage&lt;/a&gt;. You see customers are clicking the current promotion banner on your homepage—it’s glowing “hot pink” from the heatmap. A-ha! Turns out your Googling customers miss this promotion and pay full price. Meanwhile your more-satisfied customers purchase confidently, knowing they’re getting the best possible deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Combining Medallia with&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;FullStory gives you a clear way to know just what’s going on—a way to solve even the most challenging CX mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Get straight to the heart of a customer’s b&lt;i&gt;ad&lt;/i&gt; experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;— &lt;i&gt;“What led to this customer’s bad experience?”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Medallia Conversations lets you reach customers &lt;i&gt;during&lt;/i&gt; their experience, when their feedback is top of mind and will be the most relevant and insightful. Hopefully, most of this feedback is positive and constructive, but once in a while a customer will have a bad experience and leave negative feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now with FullStory and Medallia working together, any negative feedback captured in Medallia will also include a FullStory session URL, making it easy to jump right into the customer’s experience and see for yourself what went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Find a bug? We’ve got you covered there, too.

Read on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Have you ever reflected on how neighborhoods take shape? In the beginning, families build their homes close to one another—for protection, for socialization, for support, for efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Those families need places to gather, places to purchase goods, a place to educate their kids. So along come the grocery stores, the public houses, the schools, and the parks. Each serves an important need in the community and, in playing their part, makes the neighborhood stronger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When this works well, a vibrant ecosystem emerges—an alchemical amalgamation of people, families, and the businesses and services who support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In software, a vibrant ecosystem is as essential to business success as the neighborhood is to the community’s survival. In the same way that a neighborhood school thrives because there is also a grocery store, a public house, and a park, FullStory thrives because of and in service to the larger technology ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because wonderful solutions exist to deliver things like experience optimization, customer feedback management, performance monitoring and more, FullStory can focus on building, improving, and providing exceptional digital experience intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our Technology Partner Ecosystem represents our investment in open, integrated platforms that work together and create a fully connected tech stack ready to be leveraged by companies focused on delivering a more perfect customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a fully integrated digital experience tech stack with FullStory has been a game changer for us. With Optimizely we’re able to run experiments on our own digital experience, use Amplitude to analyze results quantitatively, and with both connected to FullStory we can easily analyze the underlying customer experience and find the best opportunities for improvement.— Matt Stein, VP of Product at Metromile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Companies like Metromile are realizing that having the right tech stack can be a competitive advantage that helps them make smarter decisions that better serve their customers—and their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Meet the partners in our neighborhood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We want to ensure that FullStory’s digital experience data enhances every other “DX” technology in your stack—bringing them all together to create a single view into your customer’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the FullStory Partner Ecosystem we further our commitment to this mission by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fostering an active, connected developer community (See what we’re doing on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bionic.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;dev-focused blog&lt;/a&gt; a.k.a. “Bionic”),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providing thorough API documentation for every integration (&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.fullstory.com/introduction&quot;&gt;learn more&lt;/a&gt;), and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making a commitment to &lt;a href=&quot;https://partners.fullstory.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;bilateral integrations&lt;/a&gt;, which allow data to flow into &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;out of FullStory so you can get the answers you need where and when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What steps are you taking to fully integrate your tech stack? &lt;a href=&quot;https://partners.fullstory.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;Explore the Integrations Directory&lt;/a&gt; today and discover how FullStory can boost the capabilities of your favorite digital experience technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;An integrated technology stack is one of the key factors that will power a more perfect, seamless digital experience.

That&amp;#x27;s why we just released webhooks in FullStory. Now you can share digital experience data from FullStory across your tech stack—so that your team can do more with less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What&amp;#x27;s the story?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Insights into a digital experience problem—or opportunity—are only useful if you can do something with them. They need to be not only relevant and actionable, you also need to nail the timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This last part is really hard. For example, how helpful is it to know that you had a huge &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;Rage Click problem&lt;/a&gt; during checkout weeks after it happened, affecting thousands of customers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Timing is everything, which is where FullStory webhooks come in. Now, you can get real-time insight into your most important digital experiences so you can get close to the customer experience and turn real-time DX insights into a high-impact course of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory&amp;#x27;s webhooks are real insights in real time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you realize it or not, webhooks power many of the digital experiences we encounter on a daily basis because they enable an application to send data in automated messages to another application when something happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To understand how webhooks work, let’s take an example from e-commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Say you&amp;#x27;re an ecommerce manager at a jewelry retailer. You want to know whenever an error occurs on the checkout page. With webhooks, you could do this is by creating a webhook in FullStory to notify your #checkout-error-remediation-squad Slack channel when more than 5 errors occur within an hour. Here, the webhook has a trigger application (FullStory), which sends data when a threshold is met (errors exceed 5 per hour) and an action application (Slack), which receives the data. Voila!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With webhooks, you can turn digital experience insights into timely notifications to take action—saving your business from lost sales and unhappy customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get hooked&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Webhooks help you to take action on your FullStory data in new ways and in the tools you already use—and they do it instantaneously. Here are four ways you can put webhooks to work in FullStory today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Custom Events&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By creating a webhook event for whenever a Custom Event is triggered, you can kick off workflows in other tools based on your FullStory data. If you aren’t already using Custom Events, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/features/custom-events/&quot;&gt;learn more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Segment alerts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Go beyond Slack or email notifications by creating segment alerts and webhooks to implement a custom workflow. For instance, fire a webhook event to page an engineer in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pagerduty.com/&quot;&gt;PagerDuty&lt;/a&gt; when a segment indicating dead clicks exceeds a set threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Note created&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Notes in FullStory help teams work together to identify and fix digital experience issues. Now you can easily send your FullStory notes to other platforms, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623894-Jira&quot;&gt;Jira&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://asana.com/&quot;&gt;Asana&lt;/a&gt;, by firing a webhook event when a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828513-How-do-I-share-notes-or-session-links-with-my-team-&quot;&gt;note is created&lt;/a&gt; in FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Mobile app crash&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/mobile-apps/&quot;&gt;FullStory for Mobile Apps&lt;/a&gt; can help you better understand what caused your mobile app to crash, but maybe you want to be alerted to crashes as they occur. Setting up a webhook can help you get this data in real time, so you can triage and respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Only account Admins will have access to your webhooks settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The data you want, when you need it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When your customers interact with your digital properties, they send constant signals indicating frustration, confusion, delight. The trouble is, most brands aren&amp;#x27;t picking up on these signals—which means missed opportunities to improve the digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, using FullStory’s webhooks, you can action your digital experience data in new ways and within the tools you already know and love—and you can do it all in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Webhooks help you turn data into action.

Why? In truth, I struggled with the contradiction of having @fullstory tweet out profound words relating to systemic racial injustice knowing that, days later, the same twitter handle is likely going to promote a whitepaper on digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To me, I worried any statement would be seen as disingenuous, misconstrued as a company trying to promote its brand on the back of such a crucial, serious moment in history.

People all over the world analyze heatmaps to improve bounce rate, increase customer retention and learn more about how people use their service—all so that their site or product better help their users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are different types of heatmaps, and each tracks different user interactions on a responsive website, like clicking and scrolling. We are going to focus on the importance of scroll maps and what they can do for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is a scroll map?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A scroll map (also called scrollmaps or scroll heatmaps) is specifically &lt;b&gt;designed to take data on how visitors scroll through a part of a website, to help identify UX improvements, make changes, and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/3-ways-to-boost-conversions/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;increase conversions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This insight shows the section of a webpage that a visitor or a viewer is scrolling through the most and least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Scroll maps are a type of heatmap that provide insights into how visitors are engaging with your website so you can spot problems and make changes. Think of it like visual web analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This type of a heatmap is useful in many different ways, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving traffic to specific parts of your site &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instantaneously identifying popular content and data patterns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously identifying the best time to act on issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Like heatmaps, scroll maps can be collected on desktop and mobile devices—and color is used to represent the most and least scrolled parts of a page. They generate scrolling “heat zones” of your website or app pages from top to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Scroll maps also include percentages of how many visitors see different parts of a page and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abtasty.com/blog/above-the-fold/&quot;&gt;average fold score&lt;/a&gt; showing what percentage of visitors see the part of your web page element that is most viewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to use a scroll map&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using a scroll map has many different benefits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Capture and keep visitor attention&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a scroll map, you can find out where you’re losing visitors’ (and customers’) attention—by where they are landing on your page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At first glance, your scroll map will show you how far down the page users go (and what captures users’ attention), which typically equals how interested they are in your brand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The bottom line—the colder the color, the fewer people will have seen that section of the webpage. It may be time to optimize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Spot false bottoms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s important to understand the concept of &amp;quot;false bottoms&amp;quot; on websites—when a user thinks their scrolling has come to the end of the page when it hasn&amp;#x27;t, or when a user doesn&amp;#x27;t realize there&amp;#x27;s more content lower down the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &amp;quot;false bottom&amp;quot; is often caused by formatting—whitespace, line breaks, or blocks in the content and a scroll map can be used to &amp;quot;depth test&amp;quot; a page to check for false bottoms. That simply means testing how far down the page to check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The results of a depth test can help you identify a specific element of a page, and if it needs to be moved higher up due to lack of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Discover if users see what’s above the fold&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A scroll map is a tool that measures the average &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abtasty.com/blog/above-the-fold/&quot;&gt;fold on a web page&lt;/a&gt; by automatically calculating where people scroll the most—and then stop, for both desktop and mobile users. The fold line is basically the cut-off point at the bottom of the screen or web browser before scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By looking at scroll map average fold data, you can place important elements above the fold in a way that works across devices. This graphic information can help increase conversions on calls to action exponentially. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Figure out if users can find what they need&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Simply put, users scroll to find what they need, so your scroll map can detect that on a level you may not be. Here are a few ways you can help your visitors find what they need on your website with a scroll map: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add filters to category pages to improve the usability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design less for efficiency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimize scrollability &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When a user is scrolling, but can’t find what they need—you need a scroll map. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Learn if your page offers a good cross-device experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Collect your own scroll map data to find out how your viewers are behaving. From there, you can understand both your web and mobile experience better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Scroll data is there to help you design pixel-perfect user experiences and you can refer to this data to find exactly where you need a CTA to capture users&amp;#x27; attention on desktop and mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pros of using scroll maps &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll maps are excellent for optimizing a visible area of a website above the fold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching key information helps you discover whether users find what they are looking for or not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll maps help to develop strategies to make more visitors scroll further down to the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching the scrolling behavior of users can help design a long landing page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A website scroll map helps you understand how to prioritize content and where to place important elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll maps are an easily understood form of data visualization, and a good springboard for combining &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;qualitative and quantitative data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The cons of using scroll maps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll maps can’t help you measure the effectiveness of the elements on your website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also don’t compare how users interact with different elements or show you page impressions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll maps &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/what-are-web-heatmaps-how-do-they-work-pros-cons-alternatives/&quot;&gt;don’t always provide accurate data&lt;/a&gt; because of aimless, scrolling activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to mouse movements, related tools like click maps can be a more reliable representation of user engagement rather than scroll maps or move maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scroll map may not be very useful for web pages with dynamic elements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do FullStory&amp;#x27;s scroll maps work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Within FullStory, the Page Insights mode lets you see &lt;a href=&quot;/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantitative data&lt;/a&gt;, in aggregate, for the specific pages that come into view while you&amp;#x27;re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/what-is-session-replay-useful-for/&quot;&gt;playing back any user&amp;#x27;s session&lt;/a&gt;. Scroll maps give you a new type of insight based on the depth of visitor engagement. When the scroll maps feature is active, FullStory detects the page in view and generates stats based on the maximum &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-digital-engagement-signals/&quot;&gt;scroll depth&lt;/a&gt; for all views to that particular page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every scroll map includes a color gradient overlay that allows you to see, at a glance, where drop offs happen. This is valuable for understanding exactly where users lose attention and how you should prioritize content in terms of hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, maybe your checkout button is the most important call to action on your page. You can use Scroll Maps to verify that this CTA stays within view for the segment of users you&amp;#x27;ve defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to get started with FullStory scroll maps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First, find any session in FullStory and hit play. From playback, click Page Insights to open the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/how-to-use-click-maps-for-analysis-of-user-interactions-on-your-web-app/&quot;&gt;click maps&lt;/a&gt; view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From there, click on scroll maps and then place the map marker at any point on the page to see, in aggregate, how many visitors scrolled to that depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: Scroll maps work best for pages that are contained from top-to-bottom with no infinite scrolling or sections with their own independent scroll behaviors. That means they usually aren&amp;#x27;t ideal for single-page apps with lots of sections that scroll on their own or any page where you click a &amp;quot;Load more&amp;quot; button to fill in more items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further reading:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/heatmap-examples/&quot;&gt;Other types of heatmap examples&lt;/a&gt; any team should pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 4 potential problems with heatmap tools]]></title><description><![CDATA[Heatmaps visualize aggregate user behaviors (clicks, mouse movements) on a website/app using color.

Well, heat mapping tools claim they can do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But can &lt;a href=&quot;/heatmap/&quot;&gt;heatmaps&lt;/a&gt; deliver the goods? And at what cost to the reliability, accuracy, and &lt;i&gt;actionability&lt;/i&gt; of the information? What are heat maps, &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What are heat maps?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Visually, heatmaps can take many forms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While heat maps are simple enough in theory, in practice they are complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do analytics tools even know which elements and areas users are paying attention to, clicking on, or mousing over? There&amp;#x27;s no common approach. Heat mapping tools might determine areas of user interaction via eye-tracking, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#what-is-session-replay&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps just aggregated clicks on links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While heatmaps have become a go-to visualization for showing digital user interactions, they are far from perfect. And perhaps it&amp;#x27;s not surprising that when it comes to heatmaps, the devil&amp;#x27;s in the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When is a heat map not a heat map? The history.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s back up for a second to understand how we got here. The term “heat map” or “heatmap” was trademarked by Cormac Kinney in the 90s to refer to a 2D financial market visualization (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;; also &lt;a href=&quot;http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75263259&amp;amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;amp;searchType=statusSearch&quot;&gt;Kinney’s lapsed Trademark&lt;/a&gt;). Today, what most of us think of as heat maps—as evidenced by our simple definiton and sample heatmaps above—is entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to Kenneth Field (a.k.a. Cartonerd) in his post &lt;a href=&quot;http://cartonerd.blogspot.com/2015/02/when-is-heat-map-not-heat-map.html&quot;&gt;When is a heat map not a heatmap&lt;/a&gt;, most of the data visualizations referred to as “heat maps” are not actually heat maps. They are technically isarithmic density maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is an isarithmic density map? We&amp;#x27;ll get there, but first it&amp;#x27;s useful to take out the &amp;quot;density&amp;quot; and speak to just isarthmic maps, which the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Isarithmic_map&quot;&gt;Geographic Information Systems encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt; defines as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A type of thematic map that represents a continuous field using isolines (lines of equal value) or isopleths (regions of similar value). They are sometimes referred to as a heatmap, although a heatmap is only one type of isarithmic map that represents density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A popular form of isarithmic map is a contour line map. Think about topographic maps—each connected line in a topographic map represents the same elevation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your run-of-the-mill topographic map uses bright line data points — elevation at specific, unique geographic locations — and interpolates (i.e. connects the dots) the missing information across the data points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That brings us to web application isarithmic &lt;i&gt;density&lt;/i&gt; maps—a.k.a. &lt;b&gt;what we all think of as heatmaps&lt;/b&gt;. Web heatmaps don’t have isolines. Instead web heatmaps use isopleths. Isopleths are used to represent regions of similar value—red, orange, and yellow, green and blue color splotches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The splotches of color on heatmaps represent aggregated user experiences on a website or application. As data visualizations go, heatmaps make for an easy-to-grok, pretty picture. You look at heatmap analyses and say, “Ah, I see!” You feel like you understand something deep and meaningful—like you&amp;#x27;re peeking behind the curtain and seeing a remarkable bit of web analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But there’s a catch—or at least four catches—and if you’re hypnotized by the glowing hotness of heatmaps, you very well might miss these problems completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4 major problems with website heatmaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to heat maps, here are at least four major problems that you should consider because they call into question the very reliability of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Lies, damned lies, and [X, Y] positions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a world of responsive design and device heterogeneity, using a visualization designed for a fixed unchanging aspect ratio is a recipe for failure. Capturing engagement with an area “100px down and 350px to the right” on your site doesn’t mean the same thing across different user visits—each of whom might be browsing from different window sizes and/or screen resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ignore these differences and you might find yourself at a confusing dead end. Responsive design and varying display PPIs also make converting between aspect ratios possible only when you make a lot of assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Heat mapping tools get around this problem by forcibly siloing datasets. You only see heatmaps with aggregate data for users with the exact same screen resolution configuration. Users with a viewport 1024×768 go here. Users with a viewport 1366×768 go there. 1280×800 users go in the cupboard. These arbitrary silos mean you aren’t actually seeing a meaningful aggregate across your actual non-same-screen-resolution-using users. Kinda defeats the purpose of the “easy” visualization, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And this is just on desktop. There are thousands of different mobile browser resolutions in the market. Most heatmap visualization solutions pretend these differences don’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yet they matter &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Average and aggregate mouse hovers and un-contextualized [X, Y] click positions cause well-intentioned product teams to make actual product changes based on shoddy information, wasting time and money, harming customer experience and negatively affecting the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Dynamic applications are the norm today&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, a single web page is no longer a static fixed document. Modern web pages and applications are dynamic. Animations, slide out panels, expanding menus and modal dialogs are the norm. As you might guess, this poses a problem for heatmaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Simply put, heatmaps don’t work well with dynamic applications where the page changes. And that is an especially huge problem for JavaScript heavy single-page applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It isn’t just JavaScript heavy applications that are a challenge. Even server rendered websites that have data-driven content have this problem. The location of the thing you click on varies by the whims of the cosmos, popular culture, your scroll position, and what article grandma happened to post on her social media wall that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You end up with aggregated positional spaghetti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And this same issue affects everything from product inventory tables on an ecommerce site to data-driven menu options in your business enterprise app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Splotch analysis is botched analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Even when the stars align and heatmaps provide accurate and meaningful aggregations of user interactions, the visualization itself doesn’t directly tell you what you probably want to know. Because those aggregated splotches often obscure the very thing that users interacted with. You have to read the heatmap tea leaves and interpret the splotches to figure out what you think users were engaging with—what button, link, or control does that blob correspond to?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You might call this effort “splotch to element mapping:”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After seeing a heatmap and completing your back-of-the-envelope “splotch mappings,” what do you do next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here, heatmaps quickly turn into &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/analytics-theater/&quot;&gt;analytics theater&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; Analytics theater is when an analysis—via a graphical visualization, chart, graph, metric, ect.—dazzles your senses with signals indicating profound insights while in reality being either completely useless or so difficult to parse into action as to become useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Heat maps without any related &lt;a href=&quot;/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantitative interaction data&lt;/a&gt; are notoriously hard to convert into actionable business intelligence (&amp;quot;actionable insights&amp;quot;) because you can&amp;#x27;t measure the potential impact of a change. If you can&amp;#x27;t measure the potential impact of a change, you can&amp;#x27;t prioritize efforts to bring change to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Visualizations without tangible data points often become distractions that only generate more questions and spur more arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Did we mention the configuration?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most heatmap solutions ask you to configure complicated URL patterns and regular expressions to tell the system how to interpret interactions on a page-by-page level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Imagine asking someone (whether non-engineer, engineer, or developer) to configure the set of possible URL regular expressions for all the important pages in a modern JavaScript application, with complex histories and dynamic URLs with identifiers in them. It’s hard to get it right in the first place, and guaranteed to go sideways the moment something changes — and your application &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If heat maps are broken, how do you visualize aggregated user interactions on your site?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Click maps are heat maps, evolved&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having thoroughly examined heatmaps as a possible solution to meet our customer’s requests for a visualization of user clicks on a web application or web page, we decided heatmaps needed to evolve into something better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That&amp;#x27;s why we built Page Insights with &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/introducing-page-insights-with-click-maps-and-inspect-mode/&quot;&gt;Click Maps&lt;/a&gt;—to make it easy to see how your users are interacting with your website, in aggregate, while gracefully dodging the four major problems of heatmaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Page Insights are resolution independent&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because FullStory records every mutation of the DOM for every page on your site where a real user visit occurs, the platform understands the structure of your site. FullStory translates this into aggregations that make sense across screen resolution, device type, and even the most dynamic and varied data driven interfaces by focusing on &lt;i&gt;Elements&lt;/i&gt;. Not just position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Page Insights take into account what’s on (or not on) the page&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you watch a replay of a user’s session with a dynamic single page application on FullStory, you realize that many things pop in and out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Page Insights is smart enough to account for these dynamic states. It shows you what’s relevant to the state of the page in the session you&amp;#x27;re viewing. Click analytics for a non-existent popup won’t be shown when the popup isn’t there, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Page Insights are visually compelling &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; actionable&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With Click Maps, you start with a foundation of precise, element-specific data that lets you see answers immediately. And if you have questions you want to drill into, you can search to find sessions related to the numbers. If you&amp;#x27;d like to add a color overlay for visualization, you can do that too. But, manually mapping splotches to your web app is no longer required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Page Insights requires zero configuration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory uses machine learning to determine which pages belong to your web site or web application. FullStory understands which pages are the same, and which pages are different. So your insights are always relevant and contextualized. No need to do complicated configuration or setup brittle URL route regular expression voodoo. It just works out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bonus! Pivot insights based on specific segments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Page Insights gives you aggregate analyses that respect the searches and segments you build in FullStory, too. (If you’re not familiar, here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;an explanation of FullStory search&lt;/a&gt;). This helps you answer questions like “What do visitors from my ad campaign click on first?” Or, &amp;quot;How do returning customers interact with our site navigation?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Page Insights make your existing FullStory segments even more useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since this blog post was originally published in 2017, FullStory has released a number of enhancements to Page Insights including Scroll Maps, another type of heatmap designed to measure how far users scroll on any page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Curious to learn more?

This means—for the vast majority of shoppers—the seamless (or not-so-seamless) experience they have when they interact with your company carries as much weight as what you’re selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The past several years have seen the customer’s &lt;b&gt;digital&lt;/b&gt; experience become increasingly important, as people take to their screens and keyboards to shop and engage with brands. And the companies that are prioritizing digital experience are leading the way. (Just look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.borndigital.com/2020/06/24/ikea-evolving-retail-chief-digital-officer-barbara-martin-coppola&quot;&gt;Ikea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.borndigital.com/2020/02/06/chipotle-digital-surges-78-is-now-one-fifth-of-all-sales&quot;&gt;Chipotle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.borndigital.com/2020/06/15/lululemon-reports-68-spike-in-d2c-sales&quot;&gt;lululemon&lt;/a&gt; to name a few.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Last year, 59% of everyday transactions were made via digital payment. This trend is only accelerating with more transactions and interactions shifting to digital channels (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/digital-experience-stats/&quot;&gt;the preferred channel for younger shoppers&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And in 2020, a global pandemic has accelerated a shift to digital—across industries—that no one could’ve predicted. Which begs the question: How are you monitoring and improving your company’s increasingly important digital experience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;How are you monitoring and improving your company’s increasingly important digital experience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Last year, Patrick Gordon, Principal Product Manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jumbointeractive.com/&quot;&gt;Jumbo Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, was working to answer this question. He was on a mission to evaluate, select, and implement a technology stack that would allow Jumbo Interactive to deliver a best-in-class digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Patrick and his team have since onboarded two foundational platforms—Segment, a customer data platform, and FullStory, a digital experience platform; they have generated a 3% increase in overall conversion rate and identified critical digital problem areas, saving the company tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because of the value they have demonstrated, the product team will likely secure their next two platforms in the coming months, including an experience optimization platform. In this post, Patrick shares:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His vision for the ideal digital experience tech stack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How he fostered adoption of both Segment and FullStory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How he demonstrates the value of each platform, unlocking further resources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 1: Understand the key levers your business is trying to pull&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First things first: Are you tuned into your company’s main priorities and business objectives? This understanding is critical in order to bring on the right technology at the right time. “Before you bring on any tech, you need to be very clear on what the business is trying to accomplish,” says Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A year ago, Jumbo Interactive was in a transition moment. The company was expanding its offering, moving from exclusively selling lottery tickets online (an ecommerce model) to also providing lottery software. This shift required a renewed focus on the customer and a commitment to a customer-driven product roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The company needed a much deeper understanding of user engagement within the product. They had some basic tracking in place, but the product team needed to understand retention, churn, and how users were actually engaging with the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“I had actually originally started looking at experimentation platforms. But I quickly realized we were nowhere near ready because we didn’t even understand what customers were doing, let alone what behaviors we wanted to modify or encourage,” says Patrick. So he sat down and outlined a 4-step vision for Jumbo Interactive’s digital experience technology stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our tech stack must:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow us to get our customer data pipeline in place,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow us to understand and improve our existing conversion funnels,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow us to find new insights to encourage innovation and enable long-tail analysis,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow us to optimize and innovate through experimentation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While your company may not be shifting to a new business model, you may very well be in the midst of an accelerated digital transformation. If your company is in any kind of transition moment, it is particularly important that you align platform success with high-level business success. This will help you make sure that the technology you bring on is tied to impact that leaders care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 2: Demonstrate platform value at every stage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Securing budget for a new platform is often a time-consuming battle for product leaders who face internal politics, competing priorities, and doubting stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Depending on past initiatives, you may be up against skepticism about usefulness, added value, and future adoption. And when it comes to digital, there is often an internal learning curve to tackle. You’ll often come up against questions like: &lt;i&gt;Do we &lt;/i&gt;really&lt;i&gt; need this? Will people use it? How do we make sure it doesn’t become shelfware?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In Patrick’s case, he knew that he wouldn’t get the buy-in or budget to onboard multiple digital experience technologies all at once. Not to mention the fact that his team didn’t have the capacity to properly onboard multiple platforms simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;He needed to be patient and methodical; he needed to implement the right platform at the right moment to unlock budget for the next platform. And he knew he needed to prove value at every step of the way on his journey to the ideal DX technology stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Jumbo Interactive addresses data plumbing with a customer data platform&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Patrick began by evaluating various customer data platforms. “I knew we were going to bring on multiple platforms in building our digital experience stack,” he explains. “I’m a programmer by trade and I also knew that we were not going to do custom integrations for all the various platforms—that, frankly, is the way of the Dodo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fortunately, the marketing team at Jumbo Interactive was already doing a proof of concept with Segment—a leading customer data platform. Patrick was able to piggyback off of their POC and demonstrate quick value, securing Segment access for all relevant teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With Segment in place, the Jumbo Interactive product team could quickly and easily set up custom events and push that custom tracking across all of the connected platforms in its stack. With the infrastructure in place to support the free flow of customer information, Patrick turned his attention to the customer’s digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Segment proves its value with every platform we onboard. With FullStory, for example, I didn’t have to rely on a team to set up an integration. I was able to get the platform up, running, and recording (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/custom-events-in-fullstory/&quot;&gt;custom events included&lt;/a&gt;) within minutes,” Patrick explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Jumbo Interactive gets the whole picture with a digital experience platform&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While he was considering how to properly connect sources of customer data, Patrick was also considering the sources of customer data themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“We had basic analytics in place—but this was mostly monitored by marketing. We didn’t have any real insight into engagement within the product. We were doing some user testing, but because of circumstances within our industry, this type of research is extremely costly and time consuming,” Patrick explains. “It’s unwieldy at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Jumbo Interactive was missing key insight into user behavior in the wild. To provide an ideal digital experience across devices, they needed to understand user behavior at an aggregate level (the scale of an issue) and they needed to be able to zoom in and see the individual user’s experience (the root cause of an issue).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Patrick also knew that his team didn’t have all of the answers; in fact, they didn’t have all of the questions. He needed a platform that would provide customer insight based on paths and funnels the product team could predict &lt;i&gt;as well as&lt;/i&gt; insight based on user behaviors they couldn’t predict. So he began evaluating digital experience platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This search led him to FullStory. “We got on a free two-week trial of FullStory. Because we already had Segment in place, we were able to get FullStory set up really quickly. And the trial clinched it, for us,” says Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;On the first day we had FullStory up and running, we identified an error that hadn’t been recorded properly by our bug tracking tool. That error had been occurring for almost six months and was probably costing us a couple of thousand dollars a day. I was able to easily show our COO and our Head of Product what was happening, how we addressed it, and the outcome. It didn’t take much convincing after that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the first day we had FullStory up and running, we identified an error that hadn’t been recorded properly by our bug tracking tool. That error had been occurring for almost six months and was probably costing us a couple of thousand dollars a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over the past several months, Jumbo Interactive has identified several business critical bugs that they would not have found without the help of FullStory. FullStory also provides much needed context to user friction across the digital experience; the product team is able to prioritize improvements that will add clear value to web and mobile users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The insight they’ve gained into how people are engaging across all platforms has led to multiple feature enhancements and one complete redesign of a key customer funnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 3: Foster adoption and be transparent about your successes and failures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Patrick is adamant about the importance of fostering widespread adoption of digital experience technology. One of his biggest areas of focuses has been eliminating the disconnect between product and engineering at Jumbo Interactive. Because nothing kills agility quicker than silos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“It’s been awesome to see our development team get really excited about FullStory. This is stuff they built and FullStory shows them the pain users feel (or don’t feel) when they’re in the product. It has definitely lit a fire,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The engineering team at Jumbo Interactive has adopted FullStory completely, building their own documentation around the platform and embedding it into their day-to-day practices. “I get messages from our developers about things they’re seeing or noticing in FullStory all the time, now,” laughs Patrick. “It’s been really exciting to see them embrace it—and that really comes down to exposure. Once you can see what the platform does, it’s easy to get excited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Patrick is also adamant about being transparent about his team’s wins and losses. “We do public quarterly updates, warts and all. We’ll show instances where we used FullStory and kind of missed the mark. And we’ll show instances where we drove a really quality outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This transparent knowledge-sharing has garnered a lot of positive feedback and interest from across the organization. Patrick and his team gain credibility and continue to show how they use Segment and FullStory to drive value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Patrick isn’t close to being done when it comes to assembling Jumbo Interactive’s digital experience tech stack. He is currently building a business case for additional platforms based on the value he is driving with FullStory and Segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“We’re building an undeniable set of good core practices that have outcomes attached to them. And we’re able to communicate that. Which means when I go to my boss to ask for the next platform and they can look back at the value we’ve proven with each new platform.

Yet many still fail to deliver an experience that is consistently beneficial for customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This failure is rarely the result of a lack of awareness or even a lack of effort—but because delivering a seamless digital experience is really &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; hard. Any of these challenges sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our organization operates on gut instinct and stakeholders often argue over what our digital priorities should be.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Teams and individuals have a hard time quickly accessing information they need to do their jobs. This slows us down.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;We waste so much time communicating across teams and trying to get on the same page. It feels like we’re all solving different problems.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Customer-facing digital teams are all using different technologies. Everyone is operating from different data sets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;We know our digital customer experience is disjointed and inconsistent, but it’s so hard to prioritize the right areas to fix first.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Digital is clearly a side priority—it doesn’t seem to be a major focus at the top.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How can companies address these challenges and create a digital experience that is the envy of their competitors? That’s what we set out to answer with new original research on the state of digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We wanted to understand what organizations that are more successful at delivering an ideal digital experience are doing differently&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; What organizational traits do they share? What activities do they invest in? What technology platforms do they have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We surveyed hundreds of digital experience professionals primarily across North America to discover how they:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structure their organization to facilitate efficient digital experience improvements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source technologies to power the digital experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about the digital experience and encourage continuous iteration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set objectives and drive digital results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;new in-depth report&lt;/a&gt; presents these research findings and provides a roadmap to help organizations replicate what works and increase their digital experience maturity—ultimately driving better digital results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Introducing ATOM: A new way to understand and develop your digital experience maturity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Understanding what digital experience success looks like is one thing. But understanding &lt;i&gt;how to achieve&lt;/i&gt; digital experience success is another thing entirely. Which is why it’s helpful to use a maturity model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory’s digital experience maturity model includes four distinct phases of maturity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase 0: An organization is in the very early stages of going “digital”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase 1: Digital and the digital experience are a prominent focus, but there is still plenty of housekeeping to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase 2: The digital experience is a top priority and the organization is focused on refining the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phase 3: The digital experience is managed seamlessly and is continuously improving. Few organizations are here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We evaluate digital experience maturity across four attributes: &lt;b&gt;Alignment&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Technology&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Outcomes&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Mindset&lt;/b&gt;. We call this approach &lt;b&gt;ATOM.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alignment&lt;/b&gt; refers to the organizational structures, processes, and practices that facilitate efficient and continuous digital experience improvement.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Because&lt;b&gt; Technology &lt;/b&gt;and digital are almost synonymous, we also evaluate maturity based on the effectiveness of the suite or stack an organization uses to power the digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outcomes&lt;/b&gt; seeks to understand digital experience objectives and an organization’s ability to achieve those objectives. And &lt;b&gt;Mindset &lt;/b&gt;refers to the organizational mindset (or culture) as well as the individual employee mindset—demonstrating how certain cultural traits support digital experience success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our findings show shared traits across more mature digital experience organizations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our research revealed several key findings across the four attributes of maturity. When it comes to organizational &lt;b&gt;Alignment&lt;/b&gt;, we found that organizations that report being more able to deliver an ideal digital experience are more likely to (have):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An executive owner who is responsible for digital experience success&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared and transparent organizational objectives for digital experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to create consensus at the top-level around digital experience priorities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use cross-functional team structures to enable digital experience improvement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratize information that facilitates employee autonomy and fast decision-making&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A documented ideal customer journey across digital and non-digital channels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to reduce the impact of disconnected teams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, more mature organizations are 64% more likely to report that they structure teams cross-functionally:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In terms of &lt;b&gt;Technology&lt;/b&gt;, we see that organizations that report being more able to deliver an ideal digital experience are more likely to have technologies that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow teams to directly access the data they need to do their jobs (however, organizations across the maturity spectrum struggle to provide teams to access the &lt;i&gt;same &lt;/i&gt;customer data)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide a complete view of the customer’s digital experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow for customer insights to be customized based on the audience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncover user trends in aggregate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are highly integrated, diminishing the impact of disconnected teams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow teams to ship fixes and improvements quickly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to the data, for example, more mature organizations are much more likely to report that they currently have a complete picture of the customer&amp;#x27;s digital experience (though this number is still relatively low).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The research also demonstrates organizations that set longer-term objectives and increase their maturity across the key attributes of alignment, technology, and mindset are more likely to see results—to drive &lt;b&gt;Outcomes&lt;/b&gt;. More mature digital experience organizations are more likely to report being able to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easily prioritize digital fixes and improvements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quickly ship digital fixes and improvements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translate customer insights into action&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimize the digital experience for key conversions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As demonstrated by the graph below, more mature organizations are much more likely to report that it is easy to optimize for key conversions. However, this number is still quite low, indicating plenty of room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, our research reveals the primary &lt;b&gt;Mindset &lt;/b&gt;or cultural traits shared by organizations that deliver more perfect digital experiences. Organizations that report being more able to deliver an ideal digital experience are more likely to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Report that the digital experience is an extremely high priority&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritize customer empathy and seek to understand the &lt;i&gt;why &lt;/i&gt;behind customer behavior&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rely on evidence over gut feeling to make digital experience decisions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrate intentional failure and encourage individuals to test and learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, less successful organizations are 36% more likely to report that they rely on gut instinct when it comes to making decisions about the digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get your copy of the complete report today to explore all of the findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;Get the full report&lt;/a&gt; for an in-depth look at our findings along with strategic recommendations to increase your organization’s digital experience maturity and drive bottom-line impact from your digital efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Making kubectl easier with custom plugins]]></title><description><![CDATA[Custom kubectl plugins are a great way to consolidate common Kubernetes management actions in a way that are easily distributed across teams.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/kubectl-custom-plugins</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/kubectl-custom-plugins</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nick Mitchinson]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory we make wide use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;, the open-source container orchestration platform. Kubernetes is the base of almost all of our internal infrastructure, and powers multiple clusters across our environments. As a company, we have developed quite a list of repeated, complex actions that are executed against a variety of clusters. These are typically read-only actions, such as extracting or calculating a piece of information from a given cluster. We wanted a way to make these new commands easy-to-use by the rest of the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These complex, oft-repeated tasks are a perfect use case for writing our own custom `kubectl` plugins. Custom plugins let us neatly wrap up repeated actions against Kubernetes clusters in a discoverable way for the rest of our team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a quick refresher, a kubectl plugin is simply an executable on your `$PATH` which is prefixed with “kubectl-”; an executable named “kubectl-foo” is accessible by running `kubectl foo`.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As an example, in the past we had been fighting with a noticeable increase in `OOMKilled` errors across a couple of our services, which occur when a container attempts to use more memory than has been allocated to it. In order to dive deeper, we needed to know which particular pod was impacted, however this information was not available through our alerting pipeline at the time. It was common for our engineers to pass around large `jsonpath` schema selectors to use with `kubectl get`. To make this easier for everyone we created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/nrmitchi/b303dc2bf4cdaf947892cbeeb8de6a92&quot;&gt;quick script&lt;/a&gt; to identify and sort pods with recent restarts. The basic logic of our `kubectl-lastrestarts` plugin is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make a Kubernetes API call to list all pods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extract the time of the last exit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Print out the last container exit time, along with the reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After adding this basic plugin to our path, we are now able to get the results we need with the command `kubectl lastrestarts`.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Side note: If you are more familiar with the workings of Kubernetes, you may notice that this approach does not allow us to track events historically since some pods may be missing if they have been removed since their exit. This is why a proper monitoring stack is a necessity for accurate tracking of these events. For the use cases that our team was encountering, potentially missing pods are something that we are able to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Distributing Kubectl Plugins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are multiple ways to distribute kubectl plugins. In “the wild”, there is an impressive list of existing plugins available from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/&quot;&gt;Krew plugin repository&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to explore and use public plugins, or publish your own plugins to the world, this is likely the path you want to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we distribute our kubectl plugins as part of our existing monorepo workflow. We are already using &lt;a href=&quot;https://direnv.net/&quot;&gt;direnv&lt;/a&gt; to control the environment within our development environments, and our existing build routine places all of our build binaries onto the $PATH for the project. This ensures that any engineer, after building the workspace, has our entire fleet of kubectl plugins available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Do-s and Don’t-s of Plugins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Kubectl plugins are very handy for quickly addressing a specific problem. Much of the convenience comes from the familiarity of the existing tooling, which in this case is kubectl. We could get the same functionality by invoking a script directly, but that adds more cognitive load and complexity to the user of these tools since they need to remember which tools exist, how each one behaves, and where they live. You lose the kubectl functionality that you are already familiar with. This means that your plugins should behave as closely to a “native” command as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do &lt;/b&gt;Accept any common `kubectl` arguments that your team uses. `-n &amp;lt;namespace`, `-A` (all namespaces), and `--context` should be accepted when applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do&lt;/b&gt; use a kubernetes client, rather than sub-shell-ing kubectl commands. This makes your plugin less environment-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are shelling out to kubectl subprocess&lt;/b&gt;: explicitly set `--context` if you are making multiple underlying `kubectl` command calls. You cannot assume that the global `current-context` will not change during a longer-running plugin command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not&lt;/b&gt; change the current global `kubectl` context within your script&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not&lt;/b&gt; use existing `kubectl` arguments for non-standard purposes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Power of kubectl Plugins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Custom kubectl plugins are a great way to consolidate common Kubernetes management actions in a way that are easily distributed across teams. Our kubectl-lastrestarts plugin has simplified Kubernetes cluster debugging and management and increased the speed that we can diagnose problems with our services.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How our product team uses FullStory on FullStory to remove friction and optimize the user login flow]]></title><description><![CDATA[We explore how we used FullStory to discover (and fix!) issues in our user login flow, to create a more seamless first touchpoint for our users.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/optimize-user-login-flow-with-fullstory</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/optimize-user-login-flow-with-fullstory</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Madison Eubanks]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2020 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article summary:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; In this post, we walk through how the FullStory product team used the FullStory platform to uncover and address friction in our user login flow. This content is particularly relevant for SaaS product teams.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ll be the first to admit that watching user sessions in FullStory can sometimes be painful. &lt;i&gt;Really&lt;/i&gt; painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The ability to see your user struggling to navigate your online store or software is valuable and telling, of course, but it can also be a deeply cringey experience for product and engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Those hard-to-watch sessions often feel like both a blessing and a curse:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thank goodness we’ve uncovered this glaring issue in our digital experience!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;But we hate thinking about all the users who have encountered this problem on our app...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;However cringe-worthy, ignorance is not bliss when it comes to customer experience problems, and the FullStory platform is designed to reveal those unknown points of user frustration. Just like our customers, FullStory teams use FullStory to identify issues within our own product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That’s how we learned about (and fixed!) a less-than-ideal login flow—a critical moment in the user’s journey that can often make or break engagement and adoption. In this post, we explore how we did it and offer a roadmap for other SaaS product teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 1: Discovering and understanding the problem in the user login flow&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory is an ‘experience’ platform; it exists to help teams make digital products and experiences more usable. Which means we think and talk about customer experience (CX) &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt;. We define customer experience as the interactions and exchanges a customer has with a business and the way that customer perceives that businesses, from first touchpoint to last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With experience in mind, the FullStory product team is constantly monitoring how users interact with our platform, across multiple touch points. Recently, we uncovered that users were running into all sorts of issues and confusion before they’d even accessed FullStory—in that first touchpoint, as they attempted to log in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The original user login experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As with many SaaS platforms, there are two primary ways to log in to FullStory: with a username and password (which is used by most of our business plan customers), or with a single sign on (which is used by many, but not all, of our enterprise plan customers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Previously, when a user navigated to the FullStory website and clicked “Log In” in the top right corner, they were taken to the standard login page, which requested a username and password. If an enterprise-level single sign on (SSO) user attempted to log in here, they would be denied because their organization requires SSO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the flip side, if an enterprise-level non-SSO user landed on the standard login page and saw the button to use SSO, they would often select that option, thinking it was correct. And again, the login attempt would fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And finally, when an enterprise-level SSO user &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; navigate to the correct login page, they were asked to input the team name that was associated with their organization’s account. After noticing that users seemed puzzled by the team name, we pre-filled this field for clarity, but users would erase it and type in their email address. And, of course, the login attempt would fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;All too often, a login session looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As soon as the product team identified the login as a potential problem spot, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020622754-Can-I-save-searches-that-I-use-frequently-create-a-segment-&quot;&gt;built a Segment&lt;/a&gt; inside FullStory to identify users who had seen one or more error messages, and distilled that information down into three main issues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business plan customers mistakenly navigating to the enterprise login page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise plan customers mistakenly navigating to the standard login page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise plan customers experiencing confusion due to the team name input&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 2: Determining the scale of the issue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using this Segment, the team could instantly see session replays of customers struggling or altogether failing to log in to their FullStory accounts. But to build a business case for prioritizing a fix, they needed to go beyond session replay and extract some hard metrics around this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By searching for sessions in FullStory where users encountered any of three error URLs, they discovered that nearly a third of our users were experiencing error messages on the login page. Roughly 30% of FullStory users were unable to log in to the platform on their first attempt, and sometimes not even on the second, third... or tenth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a company that champions the idea that everyone benefits from a more perfect digital experience, it was a blow to realize that we’d been giving a pretty darn bad one to our users in this particular workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Armed with FullStory data, the team began examining FullStory session replays and brainstorming how to make the login flow more intuitive and user-friendly, keeping two questions top-of-mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;How can we make sure the login experience is equally excellent for both business and enterprise-level FullStory customers?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;And furthermore, how can we make sure we are going above-and-beyond to provide a login experience that exceeds our enterprise-level customers’ expectations?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 3: Designing a solution to improve the user login flow&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to think through how to create an ideal login experience for every customer, we built a flow chart, incorporating every user path that can occur from the login page. That visualization, paired with the previously determined problem types, led us to identify three key elements to implement into the new login flow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Put users on the correct login path based on their email address&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As mentioned above, there are two ways a user might log in to their FullStory account, depending on how their organization operates: by using a password or with single sign on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The previous login experience asked the user to guess which option their organization used, which often led to failed login attempts. Instead, the product team proposed automatically pushing the user into the correct login flow using their email address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the new flow, a user is prompted to enter their email address and is then routed appropriately based on their organization’s login preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From there, password users are prompted to enter their password, while SSO users are redirected to their enterprise login page. The user doesn’t need to know which of these is their login method; FullStory does the work for them, eliminating password vs. SSO confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By routing the user to the appropriate flow from the first step, we can ensure that the login process is seamless and quick for both business and enterprise plan customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Build a dedicated login page for each enterprise customer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most product folks know that—particularly in larger companies—software can quickly become shelfware. If you can’t facilitate adoption and engagement at scale, you will struggle to get value from what could be an extremely valuable platform. Like most software providers, we are constantly working to help our customers get into our platform and get as much value from it as they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because our enterprise customers are generally large companies that are trying to promote FullStory adoption across many individual users, we hypothesized that a custom login experience would help motivate users to get into the platform. So as a part of our login flow reboot, we decided to build custom login pages for each enterprise customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These branded pages are bookmark-able and require no input, creating a consistent, premium login experience. By eliminating the requirement to enter login credentials, we eliminated the possibility for users to fail to log in. This makes the barrier to enter FullStory for any enterprise user extremely low, meaning that individual users are more likely to get into the platform and start using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Provide more informative error messaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We all know the feeling of entering a username and password and receiving the (completely unhelpful) message, “Login failed.” Which part failed? Is it my username or the password that’s incorrect? Did I change my password recently? Do I even have an account?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the ideal is a completely error-free login experience, there will always be unforeseen issues that occur. But even if we can’t eliminate errors entirely, we can provide increased clarity by making our error messages more informative for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the new login flow, we implemented error messaging that actually provides information on why the login failed—whether the user entered the incorrect password or because they simply don’t have a seat in their organization’s FullStory account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When a login does fail, the user will have the information they need to rectify the situation. This additional clarity reduces stress on our support team, as we can more easily identify whether the user needs to speak to us or to their own account admin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 4: Monitoring the results of the new user login experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to monitor how these changes impact user experience, the team built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050058893-Dashboards-Overview&quot;&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; in FullStory. There, they can easily monitor the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052381313-Metrics-Overview&quot;&gt;Metric&lt;/a&gt; that calculates the percentage of users who experience error messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since rolling out these updates, we’ve seen the percentage of users who receive (newly informative) error messages on the login page cut nearly in half, down from around 30% to about 17%. This indicates we are providing a quantifiably better first experience for our users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And with our login flow Dashboard, we can continue to keep a pulse on those metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to apply this account to your work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re already a FullStory user, here are some practical steps for using FullStory to improve your own login flow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examine&lt;/b&gt;: Build an error messaging Segment in FullStory to see how many of your users are struggling at login. If it’s a high number, watch sessions to pick up on trends of where exactly things go wrong. (How many sessions should you watch? (How many sessions should you watch? &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/how-many-fullstory-sessions-to-watch/&quot;&gt;The short answer is five.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Build&lt;/b&gt;: Based on your discoveries, establish what an ideal login session would look like on your site or app, and implement changes as needed. For us, that involved creating a detailed flow chart. This could result in small tweaks to your error messaging, or a complete overhaul, as in our case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observe&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050046953-Getting-Started-with-Dashboards&quot;&gt;Build a Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; in FullStory for at-a-glance metric monitoring. Ideally, the number of users who receive error messaging will decline after you initiate changes to the process, but the Dashboard will allow you to easily see what works or doesn’t work and iterate accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re not already a FullStory user but want to learn more about the platform, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo/&quot;&gt;schedule a demo&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Do you have other ideas for how to create a more perfect login experience for your users, or have you put any of these ideas into effect at your organization?

The physiology of friction, for one thing. When someone gets stuck while they are trying to complete a task—like adding a product to their cart—cortisol levels rise. It’s a natural, physical response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this stressed-state, emotions are amplified and experiences are more likely to make a lasting impression. This means a (positive or negative) support experience can greatly influence how a customer views your brand, ultimately impacting customer retention and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As more and more people head online to do their shopping, companies are scrambling to adapt their shopping experiences to a digital-first, self-service reality. This scramble means many companies are delivering less-than-perfect digital experiences, which in turn means increased customer confusion and pressure on support teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Companies that are able to deliver both an ideal digital experience &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; extraordinary customer support are leveraging a best-in-class technology stack that allows them to minimize costs while addressing customer pain effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;When customer service reps feel the systems or tools they use enhance their ability to handle customer issues and simplify their day-to-day work, their productivity can increase by up to 20%, customer satisfaction increases by 11% and customer effort decreases by 9%,” via &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-customer-service-tech-trends-for-2020/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gartner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While a great digital support experience can look different depending on context, there are three common attributes of effective customer support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Care&lt;/b&gt;: Do you have empathy for your customer’s pain? Are you able to demonstrate empathy in your response? Does your customer feel heard?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clarity&lt;/b&gt;: Are you able to clearly, confidently, and competently communicate to your customer that you understand their issue and have the power to fix it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consistency&lt;/b&gt;: Are you able to consistently deliver on customer expectations? Are you able to quickly acknowledge and respond to a customer’s complaint or issue? How quickly and effectively can you actually resolve the issue?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The right tech stack should facilitate each of these. Working in concert, your digital support platforms should allow your support team(s) to communicate seamlessly with customers—with care and clarity—&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; quickly resolve issues. The goal is to strike the perfect balance between human touch and efficient automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To that end, we are excited to introduce &lt;b&gt;the modern customer support stack&lt;/b&gt;, a collaboration between best-in-class technology solutions across eight key technology categories that power digital customer support:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer relationship management (CRM)&lt;/b&gt;: Generally highly customizable and extensible platforms, designed to provide shared visibility into the status of past, current, and prospective customer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer success platforms (live chat and customer support)&lt;/b&gt;: Platforms that allow you to centralize all customer data into an accessible 360-degree view of the customer, and facilitate support-related communication with customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer feedback management and voice of customer solutions&lt;/b&gt;: These tools automate the collection and management of feedback from customers or stakeholders and help to incorporate that feedback directly into daily business operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Call tracking and call center solutions&lt;/b&gt;: With these solutions, companies can trace each incoming call back to the online source where the caller experienced an issue&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bug tracking and application performance management&lt;/b&gt;: These platforms provide a repository that explains how to reproduce a bug and how widespread an issue is, and allow a company to separate, prioritize, sequence, and provide communications about different bugs across many projects or applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital adoption platforms&lt;/b&gt;: These platforms enable companies with complex digital products to create feature tours, embed tooltips, or inject instructions, interactive guides, and in-line documentation to guide users through their digital products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Experience optimization platforms (experimentation and personalization)&lt;/b&gt;: Platforms that provide companies with a suite of tools to launch and manage digital experiments and dynamic experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team collaboration solutions&lt;/b&gt;: These solutions provide an online or intranet-based environment for virtual teamwork, enabling your digital teams to share information easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a new guide, we look at each category from a &lt;b&gt;problem, solution, outcome&lt;/b&gt; perspective and outline how you can use FullStory—your digital experience platform–to amplify the current tools in your stack, and deliver a more perfect digital customer support experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The guide also includes real-world and example use cases to illustrate how companies are combining these platforms to power better customer support experiences, and how you can assemble your own modern support stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, one company shared how they use their customer feedback management solution, Qualtrics, in tandem with their digital experience analytics platform, FullStory:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;What do you do when you receive vague customer feedback about a “bug” on your site or app? When your support team knows there’s an issue, but doesn’t have the tools to quickly resolve and respond? This was the situation for one company prior to using FullStory alongside Qualtrics—their customer feedback management platform.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Previously, support would receive customer feedback about a bug. Before they could pass the issue to engineering, they would have to gather several additional examples of customers experiencing that same bug, then fill out a form with a package of supporting information: description of the error, screenshots, device type, browser, play-by-play of what the customer was doing before encountering the issue, etc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;This often required extensive back-and-forth with an already-frustrated customer. The process was lengthy and costly, requiring a ton of support time and effort. And after all of that, engineering would often return with a note that they couldn’t recreate the error.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now, with FullStory and Qualtrics, a customer’s session URL is appended to their feedback. Support can easily send that session with all the necessary metadata and console logs to engineering. Using &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034693073-Watched-Elements-Can-I-search-for-CSS-elements-without-a-click-event-&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Watched Elements&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, the support agent can zoom out and—in a few clicks—see all of the other customers that are being affected by this issue. With both solutions, this company has been able to increase support capacity, cutting support-related costs by 20-30%.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;In case you missed it:&lt;/b&gt; We recently sat down with Ben Rosenberg, VP of Sender Experience from fast-growth SaaS company Sendoso, and John Cason, Client Support Manager at SalesLoft, for a discussion on the current customer support landscape, the challenges support leaders are facing, and the technologies that power modern support teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/Modern-Support-Stack-Webinar.html&quot;&gt;Watch the on-demand session, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building APIs with the AWS CDK + Lerna + Webpack: Part 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[How we used the AWS CDK to build the simple API at the core of our New Relic proof of concept. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/building-apis-aws-cdk-lerna-webpack-1</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/building-apis-aws-cdk-lerna-webpack-1</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Patrick Brandt]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[FullStory goes remote]]></title><description><![CDATA[We believe FullStorians should have the ability to work from any place they thrive—whether that's at home, at the office, or a combination of the two.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-goes-remote/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-goes-remote/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sarah Ulrich]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2020 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Atlanta has always played a feature role in the FullStory story. From our earlier days on Castleberry Hill, Marietta Street and Armour Yards, to our current office on Peachtree Street, our Atlanta roots run deep. As a digital experience company with a mission to make the web better, you might even say that we were 404-found (😉).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As the FullStory product and customer base expanded over the years, we found ourselves asking if it made sense to restrict our growth to those that could be physically present in the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That question led us to the decision to start hiring distributed software engineers with deep, niche expertise and sellers with strong regional ties that could support an ever-growing customer base. Our guiding principle was (and is) to hire the best FullStorians we could find, wherever we could find them. We leaned on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics/&quot;&gt;Watchwords&lt;/a&gt;— empathy, clarity, and bionics— to support a culture that could scale remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fast forward to March 2020. When much of the world was thrust into an unfamiliar WFH/remote lifestyle, FullStory relied on the communication and collaboration muscles we’d already been cultivating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At that point, 25% of our teammates were already distributed across 25 states and 3 countries. Those long-time remoters offered up all kinds of tips and tricks on how to best work from home, and we worked hard to provide resources to make the transition to WFH as smooth as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We also got creative. In true FullStory fashion, when our virtual meetings were lacking in audience participation, a few engineers developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://bionic.fullstory.com/bwamp/&quot;&gt;BWAMP&lt;/a&gt;, a web app that allows teammates to engage with virtual meetings through an interactive sound backdrop. (It’s also free and available for you to use too—&lt;a href=&quot;http://bwamp.me/&quot;&gt;check it out!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We adapted well, but after six months of working remotely and so much uncertainty still ahead, we knew we needed to take a more long-term stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We want FullStory to be a place where people can grow and thrive. And a huge part of thriving is the ability to work from a location that sparks creativity, productivity, and joy. Some employees will crave being in an office, others will delight in avoiding a commute—but that decision should be up to each individual FullStorian. Even once the pandemic subsides, Atlanta-based FullStorians will now have a choice to work from home, from the office, or some blend of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our headquarters isn’t going anywhere. We continue to believe in the intrinsic value of people gathering together and the spontaneous, serendipitous in-person connections that result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As it becomes safer to travel and gather in larger groups, FullStory HQ will serve as “home base” for regular team off-sites, aligning on what’s to come, and to “pop in” for connecting IRL. Atlanta will always be a leading character in our story, and the office will (once again) serve as an energizing place for folks to create and collaborate—but FullStory is and will be a world-class distributed company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’re ready and excited for the opportunities this brings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interested in joining the FullStory team?

Companies of all sizes have begun to recognize the value that this unique role can add to their Engineering organization, especially as their team matures and their technical and organizational complexity skyrockets. The list of well-known, high-performing software companies currently leveraging TPMs is a long one and includes the likes of Google, Amazon, Slack, Square, Stripe, Lyft, and Dropbox. In this post we&amp;#x27;ll discuss why we decided it was time to introduce the TPM role at FullStory, our specific brand of TPM, and some of the results we&amp;#x27;ve seen since starting the team in February 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Picture It: FullStory, 2019&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We first started seriously discussing the idea of TPM at FullStory during the second half of 2019. At that time, there were a handful of motivating factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our Product Engineering team was growing in every conceivable way. For one thing, there were more people! I joined FullStory in April 2018 when there were ~20 product engineers. By Q4 2019, that number exceeded 50. But while the influx of new coworkers was perhaps the most obvious sign of growth, it was actually the less-tangible aspects of our organization that were evolving the fastest. Our product and platform were changing to support new use cases and customer types. Our backend infrastructure was scaling to handle billions of requests per day. Our historically flat and fluid org structure became untenable, and it gave way to a more traditional model of teams and sub-teams. Work naturally became a bit more siloed, and projects became inherently cross-functional. And we were collaborating more closely with our counterparts outside of Engineering. It became clear that our technical and organizational complexity was only going to keep increasing, and we needed to counterbalance those forces if we wanted to maintain our velocity and continue shipping high-quality, secure, and performant software to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This brought us to the concept of technical &amp;quot;programs.&amp;quot; For our purposes, a program is a set of activities or processes that contribute toward some shared business outcome. Things like &lt;b&gt;Availability&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Cost Optimization&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Incident Response&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Engineering Velocity&lt;/b&gt; are all examples of technical programs. Since these initiatives are more infrastructural and not directly tied to hands-on product development, investing in them is often deprioritized. However, we recognized that executing these things well was critical to achieving our desired scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But while we understood the importance of making early investments in these sorts of programs, we also knew that it would be difficult to get traction on these cross-cutting initiatives within the structure of a traditional org chart. Virtually every program would require working across team boundaries (including outside of Engineering) to achieve results. For example, consider a hypothetical Availability program with the goal of ensuring that we’re always delivering a performant and reliable product experience to our customers. Of course, we’d need to work with Engineering teams to define and track availability metrics across the product. But we’d also need to collaborate with Customer Experience (how do we communicate to customers in the event of an outage?), Sales (how do we tell our high-availability story to prospects?), and Legal (how do we incorporate availability SLAs into our contracts?). From the perspective of the traditional org chart, the only “common ancestor” who would be well-positioned to coordinate this hypothetical Availability program would be someone in the C-suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stakeholders for a hypothetical Availability program in a traditional org chart&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is definitely not a scalable model! It was clear that we instead needed a dedicated function that could have holistic ownership and accountability for building, running, and optimizing these programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Enter TPM!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The mandate of the Technical Program Manager is to build and operate high-impact, cross-functional programs that span across the entire organization. TPMs have complete ownership of their programs and the associated business outcomes, and are empowered to work across teams and break down silos in order to achieve those outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adding the TPM role unlocks new organizational dynamics that wouldn’t be possible with a traditional org chart. In our Availability example above, rather than needing a C-suite executive to coordinate between all the stakeholder teams, that responsibility can be given to the TPM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introducing TPM adds flexibility and removes C-suite from the critical path&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the TPM may live within Engineering from a reporting standpoint, they also have a “dotted line” to work directly with any stakeholder teams that are relevant to their programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;An important nuance here is that TPMs don’t have managerial authority over the teams with whom they’re collaborating. While on the surface this may seem like a hindrance, this is actually a positive thing! It means that a TPM can’t simply &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; teams do something; instead, the TPM must rely on one of their core competencies: &lt;b&gt;aligning incentives&lt;/b&gt;. They must deeply understand each stakeholder’s perspective and motivations, map them to the desired outcomes, and cultivate buy-in. This in turn means that the stakeholders will be more invested in the work, which sets the program up for sustainable long-term success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another key point is that while TPMs will often create new processes as a means to add structure to their programs, the job of a TPM is not to be a bureaucrat. In fact, good TPMs have a strong aversion to unnecessary bureaucracy, and they have a knack for determining how much process is “just enough” to add value without introducing more red tape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;TPM at FullStory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;TPM is not a “one size fits all” role. There isn&amp;#x27;t a standard job description or profile of an ideal TPM, and a TPM who is extremely successful and effective in one organization may struggle in another. While there are certainly some common traits (ability to work cross-functionally, communication skills, attention to detail, etc), the specific skillset required of a TPM will depend heavily on the size, maturity, and composition of the organization. The types of programs they’ll be working on are also a factor, as certain domain expertise may be beneficial. The way that we’ve chosen to define and implement TPM at FullStory may not be right for everyone, but it works well for us at our current stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The most distinguishing characteristic of our TPM team is that we consider the &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; in TPM to be of paramount importance. &lt;b&gt;At FullStory, a TPM’s technical acumen is their biggest force-multiplier.&lt;/b&gt; It’s what enables them to ask the right questions, anticipate risks, constructively challenge opinions, and contribute meaningfully to engineering discussions. We want our TPMs to have the requisite engineering background (or equivalent practical experience) to be able to get deep into the weeds of the technologies and services that underpin their programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If the TPM role is ultimately about achieving business outcomes, why do we place such a strong emphasis on the technical aspect? In part, it’s because the programs themselves are deeply technical and require the TPM to have foundational software engineering knowledge in order to add value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But it’s also about self-sufficiency. With a small and nascent TPM team, success hinges on the ability to move quickly and independently. While our Engineering team has experienced tremendous growth over the past couple of years, it&amp;#x27;s still not massive, and engineers are a scarce resource. If a TPM needs to understand the inner workings of some part of our application, they could certainly ping some engineers and wait for a response. But if the TPM is able to search through the codebase and find the answer themselves, this saves time for everyone. Similarly, if a TPM wants some improved tooling or a new data pipeline to help accelerate their program work, they could request some engineering bandwidth to implement it. This would need to be prioritized against the rest of the team&amp;#x27;s roadmap, and it may or may not be completed in a timely manner. But if the TPM can just write the code themselves, then they can operate self-sufficiently, unblocking their own work while also preserving precious engineering time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Early Results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, how&amp;#x27;s it going so far? While our TPM team is still very small, there has been no shortage of work to do. Here’s a quick tour of some of our TPM-led programs and the results we’ve seen thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engineering Velocity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to continue delivering value to our customers, we must be able to ship software quickly and confidently. The Velocity program is dedicated to ensuring that our speed doesn’t suffer as we scale. One of the TPM team’s first undertakings as part of this program was to manage our transition from a monolithic deployment process to “independent deployments” of individual services. Historically, FullStory had a single weekly deploy for all of the various microservices within our architecture. This served us well for quite a while, but as our organization matured and the number of services grew, it became increasingly painful. Teams were feeling bottlenecked by the release schedule. Iterating on the product was challenging because there could be up to a week’s delay from the time a commit was merged to when it was actually deployed into production. For these reasons and more, we ultimately decided it was time to migrate to independently-deployed (ID) services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The TPM team was responsible for making sure that all of our approximately 100 microservices were migrated on time. We built a tracking system so that the entire organization could transparently see the migration status of all services. We wrote code to improve our admin tooling to better support ID workflows. We held reviews with service owners to ensure that each service conformed with ID best practices. And we hosted a Lunch &amp;amp; Learn to inform the Engineering team and answer questions about the initiative. By June 2020, we had achieved 100% of our ID migration goal. We’ve already begun to see the payoff of this effort- the number of production deployments has exploded in 2020, indicating that teams are deploying their services at-will and are no longer bottlenecked by the weekly release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Increase in production deployments as a result of our Independent Deploys initiative&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost Optimization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a SaaS company, it’s no surprise that cloud infrastructure costs are an important business consideration for FullStory. It’s critical that we maintain an accurate picture of our cloud expenditures and that we can predict our future spend with high confidence. The TPM team has led the charge to make cost data transparently available to product teams for the first time. In the past, there was no easy way for service owners to determine how much their services actually cost to operate. This meant that Engineering leaders were unable to take cost into account when making prioritization and tradeoff decisions. To remedy this, the TPM team implemented an ETL pipeline from BigQuery (our data warehouse) into Looker (our business intelligence tool), enabling straightforward cost visualizations on a per-service basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Service cost visualization in Looker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We also implemented Slack alerts to inform us if a particular service experiences a day-over-day, week-over-week, or month-over-month spike in costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Automated cost spike alerting in Slack&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This newfound visibility has helped us validate the impact of recent cost-reduction measures, identify misbehaving services, and make more confident commitments about our future cloud spend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Availability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our customers must be able to trust that all parts of the FullStory platform are consistently available and performant. But it’s impossible for us to engineer our systems to be “highly available” if we haven’t first defined &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; availability means to us. We also need both the technical mechanisms and the organizational processes to track our availability and identify areas for improvement. To get us there, the TPM team took charge of bootstrapping our Availability program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First and foremost, we decided that we needed to take a customer-centric view of availability. FullStory is available only when we’re &lt;i&gt;meeting our customers’ expectations&lt;/i&gt; about the performance of the platform, regardless of our internal opinions. Customers also don’t necessarily care about the specifics of our backend architecture. Therefore, rather than defining availability at a microservice level, we instead defined five availability “components” which represent the customer-facing surface areas of our platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web Recording (our ability to reliably record customer websites)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile Recording (our ability to reliably record customer mobile apps)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;App (the FullStory web application)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;API (the FullStory REST API)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing (behind-the-scenes processing of ingested customer data)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These components provide a common language that we can use to discuss availability across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From there, we had to decide how to actually measure availability for each of these components. We chose to adopt the framework of Service Level Indicators and Service Level Objectives, which is described at length in &lt;a href=&quot;https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/service-level-objectives/&quot;&gt;Google’s definitive book&lt;/a&gt; on Site Reliability Engineering. The TPM team held workshops with each component owner to formulate an appropriate set of SLIs and SLOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, we needed to visualize and track our performance against these SLOs. We implemented per-component dashboards in Grafana which display each SLI and the corresponding SLO performance over a specified time range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;SLO dashboard for one of our availability components&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that this foundational work is complete, the real fun begins! We can start to hold periodic SLO reviews with component owners and ensure all of our metrics remain in the green. Our ultimate goal is that these SLOs will serve as a barometer of engineering quality and help guide some of our strategic prioritization decisions. For example, if a component’s SLOs are all being met, perhaps we can be a bit riskier with trying new things. But if we’re not meeting our customers’ expectations, then it may be time to temporarily press pause on feature development and dedicate some bandwidth to improving availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is just the beginning of the journey for Technical Program Management at FullStory. I’m excited to build on our existing programs, spin up brand-new ones, and help propel FullStory Engineering into our next stage of growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out!

Now, users can give friendly, easy-to-remember names and descriptions to events that previously had to be searched by their URL or CSS selector.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The story of Google is often-told: It was started in a dorm room in the late 90s by two college students, and—over the next two decades—absolutely revolutionized the internet. Though it seems commonplace now, the iconic (and seemingly omnipotent) Google search bar has, in many ways, shaped how the world uses the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a platform built by former Googlers, it makes sense that a powerful search tool also found its way into FullStory in the form of OmniSearch. This search functionality is available to each and every FullStory user, and it has long been a key differentiator for our digital experience solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Any piece of data that is indexed by FullStory can be found via OmniSearch, theoretically making it easy for users to quickly search and find any information they need. However, depending on the FullStory user’s needs, certain key data points are only identifiable–and therefore only searchable–by either their specific CSS selector, a complex URL, or a multi-part search. And while searchable, those long and complicated identifiers don’t always spring readily to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In fact, one of our enterprise customers told us that they keep an actual notebook of CSS selectors to search for in FullStory when trying to understand the scale of a particular event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory was designed to help people do their jobs better, faster, and more intentionally; no one should need to take pen to paper to remember how to search for the data they need. So, we took that feedback to heart, and created Defined Events with the goal of eliminating the pain of needing complicated search terms to find the events you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Defined Events are a new type of Custom Event in FullStory that add flexibility and ease-of-use for FullStory users across multiple departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, what exactly is a Defined Event in FullStory?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to explain what a Defined Event is, we need to back up and talk a little bit about &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623274-FS-event-API-Sending-custom-event-data-into-FullStory&quot;&gt;Custom Events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory provides a robust array of insights out-of-the-box, from user clicks to scroll maps and many things in between. However, some FullStory users want to add a further layer of context to that data by instrumenting Custom Events for events that are specific or extra-important to their business goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These events need to be coded into an organization’s FullStory instance, typically by a member of the development team. Then, any FullStory user in that organization can find instrumented Custom Events using OmniSearch and flag these events in session replays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The key thing to remember for Custom Events is that they rope in data that FullStory doesn’t automatically surface out-of-the-box–they are truly unique to an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Defined Event is a new type of Custom Event with some key differences. As mentioned, users can search for any event that FullStory collects automatically via OmniSearch, using its specific CSS selector or URL path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The trouble with that? CSS selectors and URLs are hard to remember, especially for non-technical users–hence the notebook. Defined Events allow users to give events with specific search criteria (like a multi-step user journey) a name that anyone in the organization can reference and search for in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This also meant that FullStory wasn’t necessarily operating within a company’s existing language, often creating only tenuous connections between FullStory data and internal KPIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, you can create a Defined Event right from the FullStory user interface, with no coding or developer time required. Once you create a Defined Event, any other user in your organization is able to search for it by its name in OmniSearch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With Defined Events, company-specific names can be assigned to corresponding events within FullStory, so users can see the familiar language in their FullStory &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050058893-Dashboards-Overview&quot;&gt;Dashboards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052381313-Metrics-Overview&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;/a&gt; reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s a sample situation:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Jake is an ecommerce manager for a home goods store. He wants to view sessions where users interacted with an Add to Cart button on their site’s “Outdoor Furniture” category. Because the site has multiple Add to Cart buttons, he can’t simply search for Add to Cart, but has to find the Add to Cart URL that includes /outdoor-furniture. He’s asked his dev team to set up a Custom Event for this specific search, but while he waits for it to be coded he has to rely on searching for it with a complicated URL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;With Defined Events…&lt;/b&gt; Jake can quickly and easily set up a Custom Event for the specific Add to Cart button he wants to monitor. He names it “Add to Cart - Outdoor Furniture,” and now he (and any other user in his company) can type that into OmniSearch and see data for that button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Creating a Defined Event is quick and easy:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Any FullStory user can set up a Defined Event that will then be searchable by every user in an organization. To create a Defined Event:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the event you want to save using its CSS selector, URL path or set of search criteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Inspect Mode and select Add Custom Event&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also define an event directly from the search filters inside the Segments tab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the name you want to assign to the Defined Event, a short description of the Defined Event, and the search criteria that make up the event. This info will appear when you hover over the Defined Event in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Find more details on setting up a Defined Event in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051664454-Can-I-name-events-in-FullStory-Defined-Events&quot;&gt;FullStory Knowledge Base&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What does this mean for FullStory users?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Defined Events add value for FullStory users in five key areas. By leveraging the new Defined Events capability, FullStory users can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Save time:&lt;/b&gt; Non-technical users can create Defined Events right from the UI with no coding, saving time and back-and-forth communications between developers and other teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn more from past data:&lt;/b&gt; Defined Events are &lt;b&gt;fully retroactive&lt;/b&gt;, so past data will be included in any searches and analyses for Defined Events that your organization creates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Promote internal product adoption&lt;/b&gt;: The ability to replace CSS selector names with easy-to-remember Defined Event names lowers the barrier for non-technical users at your organization to adopt FullStory. Now both new users and non-power users can more easily use the FullStory platform and access FullStory data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have greater visibility&lt;/b&gt;: Organizations can now incorporate their internal language around KPIs and meaningful end user activities, creating clearer connections between FullStory data and overarching business goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Super-charge data analysis&lt;/b&gt;: (Enterprise customers) Previously, Custom Events needed to be instrumented using the FullStory API in order to search for them in Conversions. With Defined Events, Product Managers can quickly choose the signals they want to run through a Conversion analysis directly from the user interface, without waiting for a developer to instrument them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;More example use cases for FullStory Defined Events:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A marketer wants to know every time a user clicks on “subscribe,” and have this action reported as a Subscription Event. This Subscription Event should be available to include/analyze in Search and Segment with Search Criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Defined Events can be used when two separate user interactions can equate to the same business term. For example, an end user taps “Purchase” on a website, and another user taps “Purchase” in a mobile app. Both are “Purchase” events and should be reported on as a Defined Event for Purchases, even though the CSS selectors, URLs or screens look very different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The customer wants to know every time an end user views a Product Details Page, and report that action as a “Product View.” Based on the URL path, the FullStory user can designate which product SKU the end user viewed and search for specific products. With this information, the FullStory user can then report on how many total product views have occurred and for which products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With Defined Events, you can make sure FullStory is ‘speaking’ your organization’s language–users no longer need to rely on remembering CSS selectors or URLs to surface information. Now, any user can name an event in FullStory directly from the user interface, simplifying the search process and saving your team precious time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re already a FullStory user, log into &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.fullstory.com/login/&quot;&gt;your FullStory account&lt;/a&gt; and start defining events today!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Not a user? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo/&quot;&gt;Request a FullStory demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fighting the long tail - Improving latencies for the queries that matter the most]]></title><description><![CDATA[After evaluating multiple options, here's a look at what we did to improve latencies across long-tail queries. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-to-improve-latency</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-to-improve-latency</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jaime Yap]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this blog post, we will introduce you to some key concepts relevant to scaling our analytics infrastructure at FullStory, and review some of the things we did this year to meet the needs of our largest customers - both existing and future. We will also highlight a fortuitous event - the release and adoption of AMD EPYC™ processor based N2D instances - that ended up having an outsized impact on our most important workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keeping Up With Growth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Serving complex queries over 100s of TBs of data can be difficult to do cost effectively. Doing it with very low latencies, with data that is dynamic and constantly being mutated, can be hard to do at all. We have the fortunate position at FullStory to remain a fast growing business in 2020. But with that fortune comes high expectations of our critical, state-maintaining infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We have designed our systems at FullStory (including our databases) to scale horizontally. And like most fast growing companies, we plan capacity in advance of when we need it. But back in April of this year, despite our planning, we began to see some unacceptable query performance for some of our larger customers. Their data sets, it seemed, had grown past some critical thresholds. We also had a sales pipeline filled with even larger customers, many landing imminently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Time to continue to scale out, right? Well, as with any complex stateful system, there are caveats—in this case, query aggregation was becoming a bottleneck. Due to how our primary database manages data partitioning, it would require another &lt;a href=&quot;fullstory.com/blog/how-to-improve-latency/#appendix&quot;&gt;power of 2 scaling&lt;/a&gt; in order to reduce long tail latencies for our larger customers. This meant doubling the cluster, which up until then was fine! But this time, we began seeing signals that our query aggregators were reaching their limits too, with memory constraints and nonlinear growth in CPU utilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What we had on our hands was a scaling bottleneck. But our business wasn’t going to stop growing! We &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;had to fix this&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;—and quickly. Running critical infrastructure like this can sometimes feel like being Scotty in the engine room of the Enterprise. Trying to double the output of the warp drives while the Romulans are attacking and all the consoles are sparking and on fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How fast is fast enough?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We are always working to improve performance and expand our capabilities at FullStory. Faster queries over more data is always better. But how do we know if we are meeting the right bar? What should we be measuring and how should we be measuring it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Engineers often speak in percentiles: p50, p75, p95, and p99 latencies for various service requests. The “long tail” of the distribution of latencies are often considered outliers. It’s very easy to write a high p99 off as being acceptable so long as the “common case” is fast. After all, by definition 99% of requests are faster than that, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hiding in the long tail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/powers-of-10-time-scales-in-ux/&quot;&gt;typical wisdom&lt;/a&gt; for UX responsiveness says that actions completing in under ~100ms are considered “instant”. At about 1s, users notice things being slow, but still retain continuity of focus. People get impatient after about 5s. Beyond 10s actions are no longer considered “interactive” and users will generally want to move on to doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With p75 query latencies in a few hundred milliseconds, across many thousands of happy paying customers, you could say things are great! But this sort of analysis can be a bit too simplistic, and in FullStory’s case, it doesn’t capture what we want to be measuring and optimizing for. The key observation is that the distribution isn’t uniform across all users’ experiences: we have a multi-tenant system, and every tenant has a slightly different performance curve. What we actually care about for our largest customers is &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;hiding in the long tail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s take a look at this same distribution, but instead for a larger customer’s account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our long tail latencies weren’t merely outliers that could be ignored as transient issues. They were a significant portion of requests from our customers that had the largest data sets. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;These customers are the ones that should be getting the most value from FullStory. And we were letting them down.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do you make things faster?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data makes scaling harder. And more data makes things... more harder. If you have a system designed to decouple compute from storage and elastically scale, then great! But as you scale your compute, you also need to copy data around in order to process it. That copying adds latency and cost. Conversely, you can speed things up by trading off elasticity and pre-provisioning the compute to keep it closer to the data. Lowering latencies by avoiding the need to copy data at all. There are also hybrid designs in between. It’s all tradeoffs. There is no free lunch. Pre-splitting and pre-provisioning compute is how our analytics database (Solr Cloud) manages to scale. This is ironically also the source of our query aggregation bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Getting back to our problem at hand. We needed to make our queries faster for increasingly larger data sets - and do it quickly!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We already had a bunch of systems, architectural, and algorithmic improvements in flight. In no particular order, we had been evaluating or working on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing the query aggregation bottlenecks to unblock further doubling the downstream systems and data shards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting rid of binary data partitioning entirely to not be limited to powers of 2 scaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing load on the database entirely using clever caching at various tiers of the stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot spot and critical path analysis inside the database to spot-optimize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolling out more query rendering and query planning optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Algorithmic changes inside the database itself to change the complexity of common query paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;OS and VM (including JVM GC) tuning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These kinds of solutions typically require full engineering development and deployment cycles. Many of them also involved substantial changes to large open source projects (like Solr Cloud). Which further extends the time to roll out since we (as best as we can) try to stay in sync with upstream development, and therefore aim to avoid getting stranded with large change sets that can’t be upstreamed easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Making things faster &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;right now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; meant something more tactical. As mentioned earlier, horizontal scaling was off the table (see &lt;a href=&quot;fullstory.com/blog/how-to-improve-latency/#appendix&quot;&gt;power of 2 scaling&lt;/a&gt;). But what about vertical scaling? Typically &amp;quot;vertical scaling&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;make the box bigger” for the process[s] running on it by adding more CPU cores to the box. While Lucene does support multithreaded segment searching, this is not yet exposed in Solr (or ElasticSearch for that matter). Because of that, we are limited to 1 thread per searcher querying a shard, and can only leverage those extra cores to lower latencies if we further subdivide our data. “Making the box bigger” (ie. adding more cores) is - for us at least - equivalent to horizontal scaling. To vertically scale we would actually need to make the actual CPU cores faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conveniently, making the cores faster had just become an option on GCP: Enter N2D instances, based on 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processors. These instance types &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/announcing-the-n2d-vm-family-based-on-amd&quot;&gt;had recently come out of beta&lt;/a&gt; and were aggressively priced with nearly equivalent monthly pricing per vCPU (factoring in sustained use discounts) to N1. It was time for some testing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Evaluating Options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve invested heavily in open source software, contributing things &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev&quot;&gt;we’ve built &lt;/a&gt;internally as well as funding the development of software projects we depend on. One of our investments is an open source load testing and benchmarking harness (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/solr-bench&quot;&gt;https://github.com/fullstorydev/solr-bench&lt;/a&gt;) for Solr and Lucene. With this, we’ve been able to run repeatable indexing and query load tests to help us evaluate feature and infrastructure decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our benchmarking harness spins up a cluster of VMs, and measures the time to index a few million documents, and subsequently issues a standard battery of distributed queries of various complexities, also measuring the time to complete those. This harness performs JVM warming ahead of running the indexing and querying benchmarks to measure steady state performance. It then does many runs and generates a report summarizing the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this case, smaller is better: we saw about ~17% improvement in p95 query latencies on this specific benchmark suite. Not bad, especially considering this cluster wasn’t any more expensive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Note: Google also made new N2 instances based on Intel Cascade Lake (vs “up to” SkyLake based Xeons for N1 instances) Generally Available. But their monthly pricing was significantly less attractive than N2D (more than 15% more expensive than N2D). N2D (at least on paper) offered a cost neutral change from N1, with a potential 13% cost savings over N1 if we factor in 1 year &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing#committed_use&quot;&gt;committed use discounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Real World Results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our benchmarking really amounted to synthetic laboratory testing. It’s hard to test a full production sized cluster with real production-equivalent workloads. We knew N2D would be better, but it wasn’t clear how much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We have the ability to stand up mirror copies of our primary analytics database with the same contents and running the same indexing and query workloads. We do this via a blue/green cluster deployment approach, allowing us to run two mirrored databases at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you are curious about how FullStory performs database deployments and upgrades at scale. Then check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://bionic.fullstory.com/database-upgrades-at-scale-with-zero-downtime/&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; where my colleague, Clay, talks a bit about how we migrate 100s of TBs of data to new database clusters with zero downtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So now we had 2 clusters. The legacy N1 cluster and our new N2D cluster. Both handling the same read and write load. This gave us a very direct apples to apples comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fixing The Long Tail&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’ll cut to the chase.  Some of our p99 slowest queries (for which we had like-for-like latency measurements between old and new clusters) &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;improved by ~40+%.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Here is an example of a batch of slow queries for the same workload. N2D in green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sample p95 latency for a batch of N queries for the same workload. Distribution constrained to sample from &amp;quot;very large&amp;quot; customers. Sliding window aggregated.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why did we see better results in prod than in our isolated tests? Due to the heterogenous workload mix of indexing and ad-hoc queries, it’s hard to isolate a single mechanism but we have some hypotheses. For queries hitting hundreds of nodes in parallel, the long tail latencies will be subject to the slowest node. Distributed systems with hundreds of machines are really almost like organic systems. Sometimes you have second order effects. The slowest node can have its responses driven up by things like GC pause times. And it’s possible that in production, things like GC pauses (which we didn’t benchmark in our load test) have outsized impacts on long tail latencies. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;We saw time spent in GC across all percentiles get cut in half.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;old cluster GC - all percentiles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;new cluster GC - all percentiles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cutting GC time in half also had some nice auxiliary benefits. We saw fewer Zookeeper disconnects that previously would happen when there was a very long pause. So on top of being faster and more responsive, overall cluster stability and availability was better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;TLDR&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Switching to N2D instances on GCP for our primary analytics database cut p95,99 latencies for our largest customers by as much as ~40% in some instances.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;We ended up with lower latencies&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; better utilization&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;smaller bill&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;All of which bode well for cost-efficient future infrastructure growth. Needless to say we are actively investigating deploying N2D in other parts of our stack that are compute or memory bandwidth bottlenecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Moving to N2D had the added impact of buying us much needed runway to continue working on algorithmic and system architecture improvements. We’ll need these improvements to keep up with our growth since we (presumably) can’t bank on pulling a generational CPU upgrade rabbit out of our metaphorical hats every year 😅.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So in conclusion. If you’ve not modernized the hardware powering your cloud infrastructure in the last year or so, you should probably take a look at what’s out there. For us, the new N2D instances on GCP (running on 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processors ) have been totally game changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your data is sharded via binary partitions, then you might only see long tail latencies improve once you hit a power of 2 number of partitions. Adding 50% more compute (for a single threaded processing system) for example doesn’t actually let you finish your work faster (though you do have lower utilization of compute).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Versus the next power of 2 which cleanly fits all the work units and has half the overall processing time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you further subdivide your data, making them each half the size. You then need a subsequent doubling of the compute units to fit them to the number of compute units. Halving the overall processing time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Database upgrades at scale with zero downtime]]></title><description><![CDATA[Use this multi-step blue-green migration process to upgrade database versions, migrate schemas, or complete other movements requiring hard cutovers. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/data-migration-process-steps</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/data-migration-process-steps</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Clay Goddard]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we index and serve 100s of terabytes of data to power search, analytics, and data visualizations. To upgrade database versions, migrate schemas, swap out compute instances, or complete other movements requiring hard cutovers, we rely on a multi-step blue-green migration process of the underlying data -- all while continuing to serve high fidelity results in near real time. We happen to run several large Solr clusters for our primary database, but many of the principles discussed here should apply to other sharded databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory needs fast and safe migration tooling to perform infrastructure upgrades. Custom tooling is necessary due to the difficulty of upgrading stateful services, especially those with large and rapidly evolving datasets, like ours. Since building the end-to-end database migration process for our Solr cluster, we have run full migrations multiple times to provide a better infrastructure and ultimately a better product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Version Upgrades&lt;/u&gt;
We have executed 2 major version upgrades of Solr under this migration process. We moved our entire dataset from Solr 6 to Solr 7 and then not too long after from Solr 7 to Solr 8. &lt;i&gt;Version upgrades allow us to pick up on the latest features, improvements, and fixes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multiple Clusters&lt;/u&gt;
We have executed cluster splits into multiple Solr clusters moving a subset of customers to new clusters. &lt;i&gt;Multiple clusters allow FullStory to better accommodate growth alongside improved performance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hardware Upgrades&lt;/u&gt;
We have upgraded our hardware to the new N2D family VM instances built on AMD processors through Google Cloud. &lt;i&gt;Modernizing our hardware improves performance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Migration Process&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At a high level, the migration process looks like a standard blue-green deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Migration process visualized by step.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. &lt;u&gt;Issue all writes to both the legacy and new Solr cluster.&lt;/u&gt;
All newly indexed data is written to both clusters. Live flows that perform computations or alter indexing based on the previous indexed state must account for both clusters independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. &lt;u&gt;Run migration to move all historical data from the legacy Solr cluster to the new Solr cluster.&lt;/u&gt;
All historical indexed data is copied over to the new cluster, never overwriting data that has already been inserted / updated through the live flows. This is the hard part! It takes quite a bit of work to move the massive amount of data that FullStory indexes for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;fullstory.com/blog/data-migration-process-steps/#historical-data-migration&quot;&gt;Historical Data Migration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;section below expands on this step in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. &lt;u&gt;Verify integrity of the new Solr cluster.&lt;/u&gt;
All indexed data in the new cluster is integrity checked against the source of truth data in the legacy cluster. Integrity checking must handle timing differences between writing to the legacy and new clusters in addition to the timing differences of the Solr commit intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. &lt;u&gt;Cutover reads to the new Solr cluster.&lt;/u&gt;
All live flows use the new Solr cluster as the source of truth for search and visualizations. At this point, the legacy Solr cluster can be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While each of these steps of the process could be talked about to a large extent, the most interesting of the infrastructure is the historical data migration. It contains the most moving pieces, requires high parallelization and coordination, and ultimately is the main driver of a successful migration. The technical details of this piece are explored next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Historical Data Migration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With 100s of terabytes of structured data unevenly distributed across customers, we have to run specially designed processes to efficiently move data between clusters for a reasonable migration timeline. Our process relies on three core activities: parallelization, coordination, and time slicing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Parallelization&lt;/u&gt;
A single process migrating our historical indexed data would take years to complete. For obvious reasons, this is not acceptable. One of the main design goals of the historical data migration process is to be parallelizable, providing the ability to scale up and down as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Data migration workers, parallelized, transferring historical data from the legacy to new cluster&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our data is naturally separated by customer and is amenable to parallel workers targeting each customer independently. Unfortunately, in practice, a single worker per customer would still take months to complete given the uneven distribution of data across customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To support useful parallelization, we time slice customer data based on length of retention periods and volume of data, assigning workers to process each time slice. As a result of this parallelization, the workers also require additional coordination to keep the process running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Coordination&lt;/u&gt;
With all of the workers running in parallel attempting to migrate to / from the same Solr clusters, distributed coordination is paramount to ensuring workers aren’t stepping on each other’s toes or repeating completed work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Coordination is handled through the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://zookeeper.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Zookeeper&lt;/a&gt;. At a high level, we have a structure of ephemeral claims and persistent work nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.6.2/zookeeperProgrammers.html#Ephemeral+Nodes&quot;&gt;Ephemeral claim nodes&lt;/a&gt; are required to be created and held to act on any work slice. Making a claim for work is the first thing a worker does. It will continue to make claims as work is completed or skipped until it runs out of available work. Of note, the ephemeral property is important so that non-graceful process exits will result in any held claims being freed up automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The work nodes contain the progress data. This data includes both the records processed and the latest cursor that should be used when picking the work back up upon process restart (to avoid repeating work).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Time Slicing&lt;/u&gt;
We have customers of all shapes and sizes with different retention periods and volumes of data. One customer might record the same amount of data in a week as another customer records in an entire three month period. We must account for these differences when driving our migration workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The time slicing is fairly straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determine the total number of records and retention period for a given customer’s data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slice that customer’s data into time intervals that would produce an estimated N number of records per interval, where N is based on the number of records that we believe can be processed in reasonable time (e.g. an hour) by a single worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A migration worker will address a single time slice of a single customer at a time. In the following visual, customer A has a high volume dataset with average retention, customer B has a low volume dataset with long retention, and customer C has an average volume dataset with short retention. As shown, each dataset gets sliced up using different time intervals so that each migration work slice is close to the same level of effort for the migration workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Example work slicing for different retention periods and volumes of data.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Through the use of parallelization, coordination, and time slicing -- even with fairly conservative settings -- FullStory can safely and performantly migrate our entire analytics dataset to brand new database clusters whenever we need to.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A journey into FullStory solutions engineering]]></title><description><![CDATA[Solutions Engineers are a hybrid role at FullStory.

Thankfully, the team is led by two experienced managers who provide SDRs with support, help them build their sales skills, and guide them to success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;At FullStory, we&amp;#x27;re obsessed with providing the best possible experience for our customers–even before they actually become customers. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Sales Development team is responsible for nailing those crucial first impressions and converting prospective customers into FullStory devotees. Sales Development Representatives (SDRs, for short) are mission-critical to our business, and we’re so lucky to have two outstanding leaders at the team’s helm: Paloma Warden and Odi Bosah.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;We sat down with Odi and Paloma to talk about why they love all things Sales Development and leadership.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Before we get started, let’s acknowledge the challenges of 2020. What’s life been like for you...and what have been your favorite Netflix binges? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paloma Warden&lt;/b&gt;: Working from home has led me to discover that I am more of a homebody than I thought before. I have stepped up my cooking skills (which my husband is so thankful for) and I have also started learning piano since quarantine started (don&amp;#x27;t worry, I am still terrible).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Current Netflix binges are: The Great British Baking Show, The Crown, and more recently a telenovela called Silvana Sin Lana (no shame here!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Odi Bosah&lt;/b&gt;: Current Netflix binges: Bates Motel and The Office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: So...what exactly is a Sales Development Representative (SDR)? Why are they important to FullStory?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;PW&lt;/b&gt;: A Sales Development Representative is in charge of &amp;quot;getting a foot in the door&amp;quot; with prospective businesses. The entire role is based on sharing FullStory’s value with prospective customers, learning how to communicate that value to the right stakeholders, and determining whether or not we can truly help that business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Being an SDR is not for the faint of heart. It’s one of the hardest jobs because of the cold outbound component, but those that master the SDR role are more likely to succeed as an Account Executive (AE) because of the invaluable skills they learn as an SDR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;OB&lt;/b&gt;: Sales Development is usually the first line of communication to potential customer acquisitions. SDRs identify how to meaningfully engage with the right people at the right accounts, then position the value of Fullstory and the potential impact to their specific business needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;SDRs are critical because they are the evangelists of our product and do the heavy lifting of discovering new pipeline opportunities for the business.  In other words, this team is a key source of revenue opportunities and growth for the FullStory business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Why did you choose to become an SDR manager? What’s your favorite part about your work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;PW&lt;/b&gt;: I chose to be an SDR manager because I &lt;i&gt;love &lt;/i&gt;helping people. It brings me so much joy! I also empathize with how hard the SDR role is, because I have been in the role myself. When I’m able to help an SDR gain confidence and be successful so they can take the next step in their career, that is so rewarding for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;OB&lt;/b&gt;: My favorite part of being an SDR manager is always the folks on my team! I love to coach individuals who are early in their sales career. My fulfillment comes from the ability to identify talent and motivation early, and help develop those skills. I love celebrating when folks on my team successfully take the next steps in their career journey, whether that means moving to our Account Executive team, our Customer Success team, or any other practice within FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What do FullStory’s Watchwords–&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;empathy, clarity and bionics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;–&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;b&gt;look like as an SDR?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;OB&lt;/b&gt;: Clarity - We always strive for clarity when we talk to our prospects, but we also ensure that we are always aligned on our goals as a team and know what we need to do in order to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Empathy - Despite having a team of individual contributors, the group really cares about the overall success of the SDR team and FullStory as a whole. SDRs are always going above and beyond to understand where they can help team members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bionics - Efficiency and process are key to success. We are always challenging the status quo, and figuring out how to optimize for effectiveness and efficiency on the team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What advice would you give to early career professionals looking to build a career in sales?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;PW&lt;/b&gt;: If you have aspirations of being in sales, being an SDR is one of the best things you can do to build a solid foundation. You’ll learn:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foundational skills that come into play  at the beginning of a sales cycle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The art of the approach–how to identify a prospective customer and how to best share the value based on their specific needs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to overcome common objections and how to qualify a prospective customer  before potentially handing off to an Account Executive (AE). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mastering these skills prepares an SDR for a smooth transition into the next phase of their sales career. An SDR who is familiar with building their own “book of business” (and who knows how to hustle!) is on track to becoming a highly effective Account Executive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;And by the way, Odi and Paloma are hiring.

This is especially important during times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory offers organizations the ability to identify their customers’ digital points of friction and quickly fix them, thereby enhancing the customer journey, resulting in higher conversion rates, average order values (AOVs), and increased net sales—according to a Total Economic Impact study conducted by Forrester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The study, titled The Total Economic Impact™&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;of FullStory&amp;#x27;s Digital Experience Analytics Platform, found that one large retail brand obtained &lt;b&gt;$5.63 million&lt;/b&gt; in benefits over three years, made up of increased conversion rates, efficiencies gained in error resolution, and avoided cost to remediate online customer fraud (among other benefits).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory is a digital experience analytics platform that provides complete digital interaction data, surfacing both quantitative and qualitative insights. The platform identifies, prioritizes, and helps address friction points within the digital experience, which can favorably impact an organization’s bottom line, as demonstrated by this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Forrester conducted in-depth interviews with stakeholders at an enterprise retailer with a large online presence and experience using FullStory. The insights from these interviews were used to quantify the benefits, costs, and risks associated with an investment in FullStory and project a three-year financial analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Quantified and unquantified benefits of using FullStory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The quantified benefits of using FullStory for this organization, identified over a three year period include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3% increase in cart conversion rates. Enhanced data from FullStory allows the organization to identify areas of friction and resolve these issues before losing potential customers. More visitors have a positive digital experience, which translates to lower cart abandonment, higher AOV, and an increase in sales. The annual cart conversion increase results in a three-year, risk-adjusted PV of &lt;b&gt;$4.5 million.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$1 million per year in avoided fraud costs. When a fraudulent checkout transaction is detected, the FullStory platform allows this organization to capture a malicious user’s actions, enabling quick remediation by the development team. Forrester assumes that, with FullStory, the avoided customer fraud cost totals $1 million per year, resulting in a three-year, risk- adjusted PV benefit of &lt;b&gt;$2.2 million.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;20 hours saved per defect. With FullStory monitoring the organization’s customer sessions, internal teams can resolve issues more efficiently than in their previous environment. Specifically, the product management team saves 20 hours per defect, and it eliminates its reliance on other teams to address issues, saving 8 hours per defect. The three-year PV, adjusted for risk, is &lt;b&gt;$261,000.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition, this organization identified the following unquantified benefits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Increases visibility. &lt;/b&gt;Rather than relying primarily on individual customer feedback, which can be time-consuming to interpret and often requires staff from multiple teams, FullStory provides its users visibility to detect areas of friction on a large scale, prioritizing improvements with the most impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encourages innovation. &lt;/b&gt;With up-to-date information regarding a customer’s journey, product developers, owners, and managers gain insight into the needs and desires of the organization’s consumer. These insights are valuable, as they can direct future site, banner, and product line enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provides instrumentation-free analytics. &lt;/b&gt;The organization no longer needs to “tag” all possible customer behaviors. A tagging requirement can create gaps if the predicted behavior is incorrect. Instrumentation-free analytics allow the organization to automatically index every customer interaction, eliminating the need to predict behavior and providing the organization with real-time, accurate data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eliminates information silos. &lt;/b&gt;Users across the organization gain efficiencies, as they can now access the same accurate digital experience data, reducing time needed to share details when issue resolution is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Offers simple integration and a user-friendly interface. &lt;/b&gt;According to one interviewee, FullStory integrates well with other implemented, cloud-based solutions, enhancing the features already benefiting the organization. Additionally, the user-friendly interface enables new users to quickly adopt and realize the value of FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Digital experience is today&amp;#x27;s most important competitive battleground—especially as the pandemic continues to accelerate a shift to digital for both companies and customers,&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; said Scott Voigt, CEO, FullStory. &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;This study and Forrester&amp;#x27;s analysis show how FullStory&amp;#x27;s powerful and intuitive platform enables enterprise organizations to deliver significant ROI, fast, and continued financial gains in the long term.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Prior to using FullStory, the interviewed organization lacked access to the level of analytics it needed to make fully informed, real-time decisions. It relied on manual searches and customer feedback to find and fix issues in an effort to improve the customer experience and to enhance its checkout process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Limitations in visibility prevented the organization from efficiently identifying and eliminating friction in the customer journey, and digital visibility is especially critical for pandemic preparedness and recovery. When uncertainty is rampant and customers are having to relearn how to interact with brands, now at home on digital channels, organizations need to make better, faster decisions to remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After the investment in FullStory, the organization was able to extensively monitor site visits or sessions, as well as to see online consumer behavior in detail. With clear identification of pain points in its customer conversion funnel, it could now focus on quick and efficient remediation. FullStory provides a robust set of analytics that empowers employees to find and fix issues in a timelier manner, freeing up time for staff to perform more value-added work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One stakeholder interviewed for this study put it succinctly: &lt;i&gt;“FullStory allows us to see exactly where an experience breakdown is happening.” &lt;/i&gt;Another said, &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;[We&amp;#x27;re] more efficient now because we are avoiding all the back and forth between teams. Less communication is required between development, product, QA, and business teams to resolve an issue impacting the customer experience.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/rs/002-LDF-436/images/TEI_of_FullStory.pdf&quot;&gt;Click to download the full study and to learn more about how FullStory can deliver ROI for your brand visit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[App frameworks: A story of transparency and time travel]]></title><description><![CDATA[How we created a "time machine" using Github to collect transparent metrics about our code. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/github-time-machine-app-frameworks</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/github-time-machine-app-frameworks</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Craig McCown]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2020 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introducing a suite of quantitative FullStory features, supercharged by Session Replay]]></title><description><![CDATA[FullStory is bridging the gap between quantitative and qualitative analytics by combining Session Replay with a suite of powerful analytics features. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/session-replay-elevates-qualitative-analytics</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/session-replay-elevates-qualitative-analytics</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Madison Eubanks]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article Summary:&lt;/b&gt; FullStory has long provided companies with an easy, efficient way to conduct valuable qualitative user research through high-fidelity Session Replay, &lt;a href=&quot;/heatmap/&quot;&gt;Heatmaps&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Today, with a new suite of quantitative analysis features—including Dashboards, Metrics, Defined Events, and Funnels—teams can tap into the rich data behind FullStory sessions, bringing qualitative and &lt;a href=&quot;/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantitative insights&lt;/a&gt; together to provide a more complete picture of the digital customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having a complete picture of your customers’ digital experience—that is, understanding both &lt;b&gt;what&lt;/b&gt; they do on your site and &lt;b&gt;why&lt;/b&gt; they do it—is the foundation of a successful digital strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=qualquant&quot;&gt;FullStory’s original research&lt;/a&gt; on digital experience maturity, fewer than half (46%) of digital professionals have full visibility into the challenges people face when using their site or app. This lack of visibility into the actual customer experience often leaves teams with a blurred picture of customers’ behaviors and motives, which makes it difficult to introduce effective solutions and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That’s where FullStory comes in. In this article, we explore four new features that enable FullStory users to analyze their massive dataset of customers’ digital interactions qualitatively and quantitatively—within the same platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How FullStory bridges the gap between quantitative and qualitative data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our goal has always been to build a platform that acts as a single source of truth for digital product teams, that combines &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantitative and qualitative analytics&lt;/a&gt; capabilities in a single, usable solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session Replay, a powerful qualitative tool, has always been a fundamental FullStory feature. However, the real power of FullStory is in the comprehensive, 360-degree intelligence we provide around digital experience. This data can be used to understand an individual user’s experience, but it can also be used for quantitative analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over the past few months, we’ve released a set of analysis-focused features, including Dashboards, Metrics, Defined Events, and Funnels. These features give teams the ability to zoom out and view their customer data in the context of specific business goals; teams can now do the majority of their analysis without leaving the FullStory platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These powerful new features work &lt;i&gt;with&lt;/i&gt; Session Replay. Session replay clarifies quantitative insights, allowing teams to validate aggregate measurements in real time with recreated user sessions. This ability to prove the numbers with actual sessions provides an unmatched level of trust in analysis, spurring productivity and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Doing quantitative and qualitative analysis simultaneously with new FullStory features&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory users now have access to four powerful features that work together with Session Replay to deliver clarity and context around user behavior, from a birds-eye view all the way down to individual user sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defined Events&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Defined Events are a new type of Custom Event in FullStory that let any user &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/customize-fullstory-with-defined-events/&quot;&gt;assign a customized name to an event&lt;/a&gt;, or set of events, right from the user interface. This capability fosters collaboration by providing a clear, common language around key events and eliminating the need to remember and search by CSS selectors or URLs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, Defined Events make it easy to analyze elements across your product that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044349073#mask-fs-mask&quot;&gt;masked&lt;/a&gt;, which renders their text values unsearchable, by providing a human-readable (and memorable) name for searching in FullStory. The best part? Defined Events are fully retroactive, so they will be applied to applicable events throughout the history of your FullStory data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Perhaps a FullStory user notices a behavioral trend while watching Session Replays, and wants to report on that trend to better understand it. The Defined Events feature allows that user to open Inspect Mode, then select and name the element they are interested in. Now the user can quickly search for and report on that event moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Defined Events can also be created when building a Segment by using the Create Event icon, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Learn more about Defined Events here. → &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056266754-Level-Up-with-FullStory-Defined-Events&quot;&gt;Level Up with FullStory Defined Events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Funnels&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In FullStory, Funnels allow you to run analyses on and dive into the data surrounding the conversion funnels you care about. Building a Funnel in FullStory means defining the steps you want a user to take to reach a desired goal, in order to see what percentage of users are taking a desired action, as well as how many users are dropping out along the way, and where the leaks occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you identify the areas where people are dropping out of your funnel, you can use Session Replay to figure out what’s at the root of these drop offs: confusion, friction, broken links, page speed, etc. FullStory automatically links sessions that are applicable to each stage of your funnel, so you can immediately watch sessions for customers that did or did not make it to the next step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Metrics in FullStory are the building blocks for Dashboards: they contain an event, an aggregation type, and a format for a piece of data you want to track. For example, you might create a Metric for the percentage of site visitors who are using a mobile device. With Metrics, teams can easily track the specific digital interactions that are meaningful to them, and then visualize these interactions in custom ways using Dashboards (covered next).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you save a Metric, FullStory will automatically surface applicable user sessions, allowing you to validate your Metric on the spot. That Metric is then available and searchable for everyone in your organization, which means teams have greater confidence in the data they’re using to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Learn more about Metrics here. → &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052381313-Metrics-Overview&quot;&gt;Metrics - Overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dashboards&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dashboards are custom visualizations that you can build using your Metrics, Funnels, and Defined Events. When a FullStory user wants to look at various data points that make up a particular key result, they can curate all of the relevant information into a themed Dashboard for at-a-glance updates as well as deeper insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Users can click into any given Dashboard card to see auto-linked sessions that pertain to that data. Whatever the focus of a given Dashboard, you can quickly see the aggregate numbers and easily drill into the user interactions that form the Metric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are four types of cards that can be used to build Dashboards:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;b&gt;Single Metric &lt;/b&gt;card is used to visualize data as a single number or percent, and is perfect for answering questions like “What is our average order value this week?” or “What percentage of users are on mobile devices?” Single Metric cards can also be colored dynamically, allowing users to see fluctuations at-a-glance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Funnel &lt;/b&gt;cards let you understand actions that users take toward a goal, and where users are dropping out of key flows. A Funnel card shows the overall completion rate from the first step in the funnel to the last, as well as the number of users who made it to each step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;b&gt;Trend &lt;/b&gt;card helps you understand how interactions and experiences are changing over time, and answer questions like “Are purchases going up or down week over week?” or “Do our customers encounter fewer bugs as we iterate or more bugs?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;b&gt;Text &lt;/b&gt;cards let you organize and contextualize your Dashboard by adding titles and descriptions to different sections of the Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Learn more about Dashboards here. → &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050058893-Dashboards-Overview&quot;&gt;Dashboards - Overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you combine quantitative and qualitative information, that pixelated image of your users begins to sharpen and come to life, providing you with a complete understanding about your users—which allows you to make more confident digital decisions.

Read on to find out what XM is, why it is vital in our increasingly digital world, and what you can do today to start closing experience gaps at your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is experience management (XM)?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Experience management (XM) is the process of measuring every interaction people have with a company in order to spot opportunities for improvement. The ultimate goal of experience management is to close experience gaps - the space that often exists between a person’s expectations of a company, and what that company actually delivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/80-of-ceos-couldnt-be-wrong-could-they/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;80% of CEOs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; believe their company provides an exceptional experience, but only 8% of their customers agree, most companies will find that there is a lot of work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But experience management isn’t just about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/customer/customer-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;making sure your customers are happy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A fully-formed experience management program will also measure and improve the experiences of your employees, the quality of your products, and the overall perception of your brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The rise of the experience economy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hundreds of years of economic development have brought us to the point today where experience management is the new business imperative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our ancestors lived in the agrarian economy, where raw materials like wood, cows, and wheat were the lifeblood of commerce. As a result of industrialization we eventually arrived at the goods-based economy. People became more interested in buying what others could &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; out of those raw materials - things like chairs, steak, and bread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our grandparents grew up in what we call the service economy. The big economic driver then was no longer what people &lt;i&gt;made&lt;/i&gt; but what they &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt;. Consumers were excited to show up at a restaurant where they could sit in a chair, and have their steak dinner delivered to them. Nevermind that the meal was more expensive than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the late 90s, there began to be talk of a fourth economic shift. Joseph Pine, who many consider the father of the experience economy, suggested that the goods and services of competing brands were becoming so similar that in order to have a competitive advantage companies needed to think about the way interacting with their companies made people &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt;. They needed to provide experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Joseph finally put out his theory in the groundbreaking book: &lt;i&gt;The Experience Economy: Work Is Theater &amp;amp; Every Business a Stage:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we are in an economy where experiences are the primary drivers of growth, jobs and GDP.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Joseph Pine, Father of the Experience Economy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, experiences are more important than ever. One in three customers are abandoning brands &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2018/08/05/what-customers-want-and-expect/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;after a single bad experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, causing U.S. companies more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2018/05/17/businesses-lose-75-billion-due-to-poor-customer-service/#:~:text=NewVoiceMedia&amp;#x27;s%202018%20%E2%80%9CSerial%20Switchers%E2%80%9D%20report,a%20better%20customer%20service%20experience.&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;$75 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in losses every year. Most employees are switching companies after just 3 years—a far cry from the culture of lifetime company loyalty of previous generations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But if you treat them right, customers and employees will do a lot more than stay. Customers will spend more money on your products. Employees will work longer hours for the privilege of doing business with you. If you make people feel good they’ll support what your company is doing. Welcome to the experience economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;New data for a new discipline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Experience management can help companies get a leg up in this new competitive environment, but how can you manage something if you’re not measuring it? Can you truly measure “experience” at all? That’s where experience data (X-data) comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;X-data contains peoples’ beliefs, emotions, and thoughts. It can be captured through surveys, website forms, frontline employees, and many other feedback channels. It may come in the form of open-text feedback or more recognized XM metrics like Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Customer Effort Score (CES). While most of the data that businesses take into account is focused on “what is happening” – we call this operational data (O-data) – X-data can uncover the “why” behind it. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;O-data may tell you that your customers are returning a newly-released winter coat at record levels. X-data can explain that customers didn’t think it was warm enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;O-data may tell you that cart abandonment is up on your ecommerce website. X-data can explain that customers became frustrated with a certain step in the checkout process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;O-data may tell you that a certain new hire hasn’t been able to close as many tickets as others. X-data can explain that customers thought he was talking too much on their support calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The four pillars of experience management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;X-data should be collected across the four core experiences of business: customer experience, employee experience, product experience, and brand experience. Taken together, these four experience management subcategories give leaders a thorough view of the state of experiences at their company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Customer experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer experience (shortened to CX) refers to how a customer perceives your business based on the sum total of their exposure to it. Unlike customer service or customer relationship management, CX does not map neatly to a single area of your business. To improve CX, you need to learn about how your customers interact with every aspect of your company and step in to close the gaps you find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Employee experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From the moment someone looks at your job ad, to the moment they leave your company, everything that worker learns, does, sees and feels contributes to their employee experience. For an organization to master employee experience, it must listen to its people at each stage of the employee lifecycle, identify what matters most to them, and create personalized experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Product experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Product experience is what drives target customers’ perceptions of product design, features, and functions, which influence their purchase and usage behavior. In order to develop compelling products in the future, businesses need researchers, product leaders, and marketers to go beyond simply collecting customer feedback. The next generation of leaders must be product experience experts who focus on the entire product lifecycle. Focusing on the lifecycle allows them to provide actionable recommendations that continually improve the experience and measurably impact the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Brand experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Brand experience is the high-level perception and awareness of who your company is and what they do. Building lasting brands is more challenging than ever, and companies need to relentlessly monitor and improve how their brands are perceived. Managing brand experience helps increase sales volume, command a higher price for products, and create motivating brand perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital: A powerful channel for experience delivery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Managing the four core experiences of business can be overwhelming. You’ll want to map out your customers’ journey, study employee engagement, run product concept tests, track brand awareness, and plenty more. But there are a handful of times when all four experiences cross through a single medium. Perhaps none is more important today than digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When we talk about digital, we mean assets like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your website&lt;/b&gt; - where potential customers can get to know your products, the first place current customers will go when they have issues, and your primary tool for collecting job applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your app &lt;/b&gt;- where you can deliver extra value to your most valuable customers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your social media accounts&lt;/b&gt; - where people often see your brand for the first time and integrate you into their day-to-day lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Internal communication tools like Slack and email &lt;/b&gt;- where employees collaborate and surface concerns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With recent shifts to remote work that aren’t going away anytime soon and massive increases in consumer screentime, optimizing your digital channels for experience is vital. Getting your digital channels right can benefit customers at every stage in the funnel, employees at every stage in their lifecycle, products throughout their development, and your brand as it grows into a powerful force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to get started improving your digital experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you’re a massive B2B company with a presence on most available digital channels or a small, direct to consumer startup with a brand new website, follow these steps to begin your journey in digital experience improvement:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Get stakeholder buy-in&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Implementing XM systems and tactics in digital will require extra work from multiple teams across your organization. You’ll be involving web dev for on-site changes, HR employee feedback solicitation, and many others. Before you get started, you’ll want to have everyone on board with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Talk to senior leadership first about the importance of experience management. Once you have their mandate it will be much easier to approach your peers in other departments. Create a preliminary plan and then form a cross-functional team to discuss more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/company-culture-digital-transformation-at-moosejaw&quot;&gt;Read more about the importance of C-level support when it comes to digital in this inteview with Michael Moore, CTO at Moosejaw Mountaineering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Listen to your customers and employees&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With everyone on your side, you’re ready to start asking customers and employees for feedback. Set up listening posts across the company. Here are a few to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-app pop up asking for feedback&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online employee suggestion box&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tab for feedback submission on the sidebar of your website&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links to feedback surveys in your social bios&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slack channel dedicated to specific employee concerns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These surveys can be completely completely opened or ask very specific questions that are important to your stakeholders. The engineering team may want to ask app users if they’ve had any issues using it. Marketing may want to know what website visitors think of your brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/modern-customer-support-tech-stack&quot;&gt;Explore the Modern Support Stack to learn more about how you can combine your technology platforms to get a clear sense of customer sentiment.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Analyze your data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once your feedback system is in place, you’ll begin to have responses pour in. Make sure each response is available to the most relevant teams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some feedback—like a website bug being flagged—you’ll want to act on immediately. Other kinds of feedback will become useful only when viewed in the context of many other replies. For example, if your product team is trying to see what current customers think of a potential new product, you need to wait until a large enough sample size of customers reply. Basing your product decisions on just a handful of customer opinions could be catastrophic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The analysis stage is much easier if you use the right platforms, like Qualtrics + FullStory. Here are key questions to consider when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/building-ideal-tech-stack&quot;&gt;building your technology stack&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can my solution(s) accurately analyze open-text feedback?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can my solution(s) aggregate data into custom dashboards?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can my solution(s) automatically surface insights?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Act on your insights&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Experience management begins with listening—but it doesn’t end until action has been taken. Acting on feedback will not only fix issues with your company, but it will show customers and employees alike that their opinions are important to you. Be sure to communicate the actions you are taking to those who inspired them. This will lead to increased levels of feedback in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over time, seek to build a culture of action into the fabric of your organization. By setting up the correct systems and being a good example yourself, the mindset of giving, receiving and acting on feedback will permeate throughout your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Craft a more perfect digital experience by integrating the Qualtrics XM Platform with FullStory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The right technologies allow you to successfully manage your digital experience. With FullStory and Qualtrics, for example, you can seamlessly reconcile qualitative customer feedback with digital experience data to understand and take action on pressing issues and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can use this integration to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoom in on sessions where a user left specific feedback, a low NPS score, or any other response data and get a full view of their experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detect how your experience metrics correlate with conversion rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get notified whenever negative feedback is provided on a key page and get more context about the user’s experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;View customer experience data across your online touch points within Qualtrics’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automatically trigger Qualtrics feedback solicits, live intercepts, and/or support tickets at the exact moment a customer experiences frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Curious about how FullStory’s digital experience analytics platform + Qualtrics’ experience management platform work together to power user experience design? &lt;a href=&quot;https://partners.fullstory.com/integrations/solution/787/qualtrics&quot;&gt;Learn more about the Qualtrics + FullStory integration here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The power of discriminated unions and exhaustiveness checking in Typescript]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this article, you'll find an example of what we learned about discriminated unions and exhaustiveness checking in Typescript and why it's useful.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/discriminated-unions-and-exhaustiveness-checking-in-typescript</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/discriminated-unions-and-exhaustiveness-checking-in-typescript</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nicholas Fahrenkrog]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Engineers at FullStory place a strong emphasis on high quality &lt;a href=&quot;https://bionic.fullstory.com/lessons-from-google-how-code-reviews-build-company-culture/&quot;&gt;“pre-commit” code reviews&lt;/a&gt;. During a recent code review, one of my peers left thorough feedback on a topic that was new to me: discriminated unions and exhaustiveness checking. This feature of Typescript is incredibly powerful and in this article I will be sharing what I learned and why it is useful. In addition, I will be sharing the use case I encountered: setting up a request/response infrastructure around websockets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What Is A Discriminated Union?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Very broadly, a discriminated union is a pattern that indicates to the compiler all of the possible types that a newly created type can represent. To create a discriminated union, all types that form the union must have the same literal member (boolean, string, number) but a unique value for that literal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The type &lt;code&gt;Coffee&lt;/code&gt; is an example of a discriminated union. The literal member in this case is &lt;code&gt;kind&lt;/code&gt;. We can use the value of &lt;code&gt;kind&lt;/code&gt; to differentiate between the types that make up &lt;code&gt;Coffee&lt;/code&gt; and handle each type differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This switch statement, on the literal member of a discriminated union, is called an “exhaustive switch”. The compiler can use the literal member to imply the type in each case statement without the need for type assertions. If we had forgotten the case statement for any of the distinct values, say &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;latte&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, the compiler would throw an error that reads &lt;code&gt;ERROR : &amp;#x27;Latte&amp;#x27; is not assignable to &amp;#x27;never&amp;#x27;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt; is a type in typescript that represents a concept in code flow analysis for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#never&quot;&gt;stuff that should never happen&lt;/a&gt;. In an exhaustive switch, once the object reaches the default case it becomes type &lt;code&gt;never&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;assertExhaustive&lt;/code&gt; is a function that takes both a parameter of type never and an optional string message and throws an exception. This is where the power of discriminated unions lies: using the compiler to check at compile time that all types are being handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Real World Example: Request/Response Infrastructure in Websockets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now let’s imagine designing a websocket api where every message the client sends to the server has a corresponding response. In this example, we will use an abstraction for a protocol object with two async methods: &lt;code&gt;sendMessage&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;handleMessage&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;sendMessage&lt;/code&gt; takes a &lt;code&gt;receiver&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;request&lt;/code&gt;, sends the request to the receiver, and returns the response from the other end of the websocket. &lt;code&gt;handleMessage&lt;/code&gt; is called on &lt;code&gt;MessageEvent&lt;/code&gt; and takes a function which responds to the request. We will be using discriminated unions and exhaustiveness checking to make the compiler enforce at compile time that every possible request is handled and that each request returns the correct type of response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To start, we will define two types of requests with a literal member &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; serves a similar function as an endpoint does in XHR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sendMessage&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;handleMessage&lt;/code&gt; methods are set up so that the compiler can use the value of &lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; to determine the request type. To send a message to the other end of the connection (represented as &lt;code&gt;receiver&lt;/code&gt;), we would write:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;action&lt;/code&gt; indicates that we are dealing with a &lt;code&gt;RequestA&lt;/code&gt;. Since the compiler knows we are sending a &lt;code&gt;RequestA&lt;/code&gt;, it allows us to also pass args. If action was &lt;code&gt;&amp;#x27;b&amp;#x27;&lt;/code&gt;, this wouldn&amp;#x27;t compile. Now let’s define response types and request/response pairings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With these defined, we can modify our previous example of &lt;code&gt;sendMessage&lt;/code&gt; to await the response and do something with it. In this case, the type of response will be &lt;code&gt;ResponseA&lt;/code&gt;, because we&amp;#x27;re sending a &lt;code&gt;RequestA&lt;/code&gt;. We are able to write &lt;code&gt;response.result&lt;/code&gt; (which is not defined on type &lt;code&gt;ResponseB&lt;/code&gt;) without a type assertion because of discriminated unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We have not yet explicitly seen how we are using discriminated unions. The protocol object that we have been referencing to call &lt;code&gt;sendMessage&lt;/code&gt; actually takes a generic during instantiation. That generic tells the compiler which types of messages it can handle (a message being a request/response pair). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now let’s consider how to handle receiving messages on the other end of the connection. By listening for &lt;code&gt;MessageEvent&lt;/code&gt; and using &lt;code&gt;handleMessage&lt;/code&gt; on a protocol created in the exact same way, we have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The exhaustive switch here forces the compiler to check that we are handling every type of request or it will throw a compile time error. The compiler also checks that the correct response type is being returned or it will throw a compile time error. So we would get an error if we tried to return &lt;code&gt;[request, { status: 500 }]&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;case &amp;#x27;a&amp;#x27;&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Excluding a few abstractions, we have now implemented a simple request/response api using the websocket transport. This api leverages the compiler to make sure that all possible requests are handled and that each request returns the correct type of response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How North America’s largest hop supplier, Yakima Chief Hops, increases its digital experience maturity]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Q&A with Yakima Chief Hops about their rapid growth, ongoing digital transformation, and approach to the ATOM digital experience maturity model. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/yakima-chief-hops-digital-experience-maturity</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/yakima-chief-hops-digital-experience-maturity</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Madison Eubanks]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 14:45:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article Summary: &lt;/b&gt;In a recent interview, Yakima Chief Hops Director of Software Engineering Jordan Gottlieb discussed the organization’s rapid growth and ongoing digital transformation strategy. Jordan also shared how Yakima Chief Hops approaches each element of FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;ATOM digital experience maturity model&lt;/a&gt;–Alignment, Technology, Outcomes, and Mindset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jordan Gottlieb, Director of Software Engineering at Yakima Chief Hops, shares how the growing organization is increasing digital experience maturity through the lens of the ATOM framework&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Will you tell us a little bit about Yakima Chief and your company does? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jordan: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yakimachief.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yakima Chief Hops&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a Washington-based supplier of hops for brewers across the globe. We are the largest 100% grower-owned hop supplier in the world, serving the entire brewing community including macro, craft, micro and home brewers. We source from a network of more than 50 family-owned farms that collaborate to grow sustainable, quality hops. At our core, we’re an agricultural company that produces innovative hop products. Our mission is to connect brewers with the family farms that grow their hops.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Much of YCH’s business is B2B, but non-B2B buyers like home brewers and smaller craft and micro-breweries can also buy hops without a contract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Would you say that Yakima Chief has gone or is going through a digital transformation? If so, what’s gone well? What’s been difficult? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jordan: &lt;/b&gt;We’re absolutely going through a digital transformation; I’d say we’re about halfway through what I’d estimate to be a seven-year transformation. By 2023 I’m projecting everything digital that needs to be implemented, automated, and integrated will be secure, stable, performant and supported by modern standard work processes. At that point we’ll be able to pivot our full focus and energy to disruptive innovation and rapid, sustainable growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One big challenge is that we’ve recently grown very quickly. Our digital footprint might be 100 times larger and infinitely more complex than it was a few short years ago, and we’ve only added six people to our software engineering team, and a dozen or so to our global IT team. We don’t have enough staff for individuals to specialize in things like a full time user research, quality assurance or DevOps program. And our marketing team is just as lean as we are. We are doing our best to expand these departments and fill these roles with the necessary talent, but it is a challenge to stay ahead of rapid growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the same note, what’s going well in our digital transformation is we’ve been able to leverage progressive, leading-edge technologies like FullStory to act as staff augmentation for urgent, important initiatives we wouldn’t have the bandwidth to cover otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: Earlier this year, FullStory identified key organizational components of DX maturity in an &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;original research report&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, also known as the ATOM digital experience maturity model. Let’s  talk about how Yakima Chief views each component of ATOM:  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
1. &lt;b&gt;Alignment: Do you have organizational structures, processes, and practices that facilitate efficient and continuous digital experience improvement? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jordan:&lt;/b&gt; We’re improving alignment every day. As mentioned, we’ve recently experienced significant year-over-year growth. We’ve grown so quickly most everyone agreed it was time to take pause, take stock, and plan very strategically for the coming years. With so many people moving that fast for so long, things do start to get lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To that end, we just wrapped a months-long strategic planning initiative involving dozens of people from throughout the org, led by our CEO and a professional consultant and facilitator. This initiative produced a comprehensive strategic plan and goals for the entire org over the next several years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We also have a new Continuous Improvement, Innovation Guiding team made up of ten people and a few executive sponsors. It’s a cross-functional team of leaders from throughout the org that function like a think tank. They help identify, document and evaluate key processes; propose, implement and execute Kaizen plans; and foster, incubate and facilitate innovation in support of the larger strategic plan. Team members don’t bring their individual departments’ needs with them to the meetings. They are encouraged to consider the organization as a whole and find ways to add global value while continuing to cultivate a just and learning culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Technology: Is the technology you use to power the digital experience effective? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jordan: &lt;/b&gt;Internally, I’d say the tools empowering our teams are very effective. Among others we leverage FullStory of course, as well as Monday, Slack, GitHub, Docker, CircleCI, Azure DevOps, Confluence, Rollbar, Freshservice, etc. Our engineering team grew from one person to seven in two years, and going fully distributed for COVID basically overnight, we had to scramble to shift to fully digital collaboration and significantly update our already relatively new standard work processes. We emphasize DevOps and containerization both for local development and production, implementing as much automation as possible along the way. Like with many organizations, different departments and teams have adopted different project management and tracking tools that can overlap, but it’s still worked out pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At Yakima Chief Hops, engineers are 90 percent of the FullStory users. Next would be marketing. We’re using FullStory as staff augmentation for proactive monitoring and quality assurance that we don’t always have the time to achieve pre-flight, especially when facing aggressive schedules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Externally, the tech we use to power the DX is very effective and we definitely match that to our team size and our company’s growth patterns, solution lifecycle and release cadences. 

It’s critical that our technologies play well together. We don’t have a suite, we have a frankenstein stack. We haven’t integrated FullStory with anything as we haven’t needed to yet, but we just started using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/session-replay-elevates-qualitative-analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory Dashboards&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which are extremely useful. For example, I just created a simple Error Clicks metric and we’ve got instant holistic insight into where Error Clicks are trending throughout our entire digital portfolio. We didn’t have quite the same ability to do that before FullStory Dashboards without writing code, even with comprehensive logging, reporting, and tools like Rollbar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Outcomes: Are you able to meet digital objectives and iterate on digital experiences? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is an area we don’t fall totally flat but we do fall short of my ideal baseline. We do have FullStory and Google Analytics, Power BI and the beginnings of a data warehouse, but it’s hard for us to prioritize formal UX research or implement AB testing at this time. So we can’t get the kind of feedback we’d need to do what you’re suggesting here. We survey the market, our business partners and end-users, both internal and external, several times a year. A lot of those are B2B customers whose day to day interactions aren’t as concerned with the more public-facing frontends, even e-commerce. They’re not as exposed to the higher-concept CX or UX, but we’re just starting to get into that as we expand our home brew, spot offerings and reach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our marketing team is starting to get more involved and a total redesign of our ecomm and marketing sites, based on customer feedback captured over the past three years, is mid-flight. A lot of decision-making ammo came from FullStory too, from watching replays. We’ve had some watch parties where we replay key sessions and scrub heat maps to figure out why people never click that one button, etc., given the opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Mindset: Does your organization have a culture that facilitates digital innovation (testing and learning, ideas can come from anywhere, etc.)? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’re steadily evolving in that direction. A key goal of the Continuous Improvement, Innovation Guiding team is to help foster a just and learning culture. Ideas can and should come from anywhere; that’s our vision and values right there. We’re mid-flight on a project that should shed light on how continuous improvement has occurred in our current rapid growth term and historically, with the goal of motivating and encouraging everyone to participate in innovation. Ideas come from everywhere. We’re putting together a framework to formalize, educate, intrinsically motivate and reward our teams for increased participation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q: What are some of your primary objectives right now? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve always been an organization that prioritizes customer service and relationships, while focusing on quality as well as product and solutions-based innovation. We’re modernizing our production and manufacturing capabilities and are heavily invested in reducing carbon emissions and other sustainability and community work. To my knowledge, we now have the largest solar array of any business in Washington State and have won some sustainability awards this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’m also involved in the strategic plan as a technology enabler. I help consult, identify, prioritize and provide tactics and measurable performance objectives in alignment with our strategic initiatives. If my team was on an island we could legitimately keep industrious into the next decade, iterating on solutions and supporting what we’ve already built – but of course we have to stay perpetually aligned with org goals and market changes. We’re still expanding our ecomm footprint, we’re still building web and mobile apps, enterprise integrations, and other proprietary solutions. We perennially iterate on our digital portfolio based on feedback from ownership, leadership, stakeholders, customers and Fullstory to continually improve our end-user experiences. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reclaim revenue with high-impact user experience improvements]]></title><description><![CDATA[Revenue Opportunities is one of the latest improvements to FullStory Conversions, available for all Enterprise plan customers. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/user-experience-issues-by-revenue</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/user-experience-issues-by-revenue</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article summary: &lt;/b&gt;Revenue Opportunities is one of the latest improvements to FullStory &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/conversions-by-fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conversions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, available for all Enterprise plan customers. By tapping into the extraordinary machine learning power of this funnel analysis product, FullStory can now ingest unique revenue events for your business and correlate friction (like errors, custom events, performance issues, etc) with lost revenue. With Revenue Opportunities, immediately understand the urgency behind digital experience issues, and expedite your prioritization and approval process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What’s FullStory Conversions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Built by our team of data science experts, Conversions uses machine learning to analyze different cohorts of users as they pass through your key workflows or funnels. By showing precisely when, where, and why users are dropping out of key workflows, Conversions enables digital teams to prioritize issues based on business impact. You can see how bugs, slowness, and frustrating user experiences directly correlate with lost conversions––and now, lost revenue. View the annualized value associated with any issue to stack rank opportunities and gather buy-in faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After speaking with many of you and conducting years of research, our team built Conversions to solve the main problem we heard from product leaders at ecommerce and SaaS companies: We have a lot of data, but we struggle daily to find clear, actionable insights and a way to prioritize them. FullStory was uniquely positioned to create a solution, so we set out to build Conversions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversions has been helping our Enterprise customers identify and prioritize issues that were costly to their business. Not only does FullStory proactively surface issues that are causing funnel drop-off, but every Opportunity is tied to a list of real user sessions from people who did or did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; convert. The ability to immediately validate insights makes them more actionable––and therefore more valuable––for our customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many improvements have been made to Conversions since launch. We found that customers were taking screenshots of the analyses surfaced in Conversions to share internally, so we added the ability to create a shareable link or download a PDF. We’ve also added functionality that allows customers to view conversion rates by top dimensions - giving them another tool to identify the root cause of an issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, our Opportunities Table (seen below) would previously rank issues only by conversion impact––a number calculated by comparing the conversion rate of both the affected and unaffected groups for a specific funnel. Today, you can choose to see Opportunities prioritized by projected annualized revenue lost––based on real customer transactions on your site or app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revenue Opportunities &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With Revenue Opportunities, you can select a Revenue Event that represents a transaction to your business, and send it directly to FullStory (&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051147573-Conversions-Revenue-Opportunities?utm_source=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=revops&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;learn more here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Our Conversions engine will pull in that event for analysis, and correlate the projected annualized revenue lost to specific issues in your funnel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unlike other solutions, FullStory takes the average value of &lt;i&gt;converted users&lt;/i&gt; that is specific to an analysis, and multiplies it by the annualized lost conversions. This average value is derived from the exact funnel you are using, any Segment that has been layered on, and the time range of the analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s important to note that these calculations are not pulled from a cart value, but from the average order value of all applicable users who converted (in other words, customers who made it to the last step in this funnel). Some customers may load up their carts with items they never intend to purchase. This means that a lost revenue analysis based on abandoned cart values could drastically overstate the expected revenue from that customer if they had actually converted. With FullStory’s innovative approach, the projected revenue lost will be most accurate for each analysis–so you can act confidently on every finding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We believe that the ability to trust your data is the most valuable thing we can offer our customers. With clarity (one of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory watchwords&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in mind, we built Conversions to be as transparent as possible, and have included abundant tooltips that break down the math behind the numbers. And the same goes for every Revenue Opportunity. Now you can reimagine the way you prioritize work, and finally have access to the full spectrum of both quantitative and qualitative data to support your decisions and punctuate your presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve found that with the right information, digital product teams are fully empowered to find high impact work that affects their bottom line and significantly improves their customers’ digital experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Connect to Google Kubernetes with GCP credentials and pure Golang]]></title><description><![CDATA[A walk through of the Go code we used to allow GKE-hosted services to connect with external clusters using Google Service Account permissions.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/connect-to-google-kubernetes-with-gcp-credentials-and-pure-golang</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/connect-to-google-kubernetes-with-gcp-credentials-and-pure-golang</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Blum]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Authenticate to GKE without kubeconfig&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Recently I built a small service that periodically connects to all of our Kubernetes clusters in a given Google Cloud Platform project and reports on what is running in each one.  As part of building this service, I had to solve a pretty basic problem: how do I connect to GKE cross-cluster (or even cross-project)?  A service running in Kubernetes can talk to its own cluster pretty trivially, but going cross-cluster means thinking about authentication. In this article, I’ll share some Go code to allow GKE-hosted services to connect with external clusters using Google Service Account permissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the outset, I figured that what I wanted to do must be possible, since this is exactly how `gcloud container clusters` works.  Running a command like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;creates or updates a local &lt;code&gt;~/.kube/config&lt;/code&gt; file. This config file is how &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; actually connects to GKE clusters using GCP credentials. I just needed to mimic the same pieces in a Go server. Should be pretty easy right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you just want the answer, feel free to &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;fullstory.com/blog/connect-to-google-kubernetes-with-gcp-credentials-and-pure-golang/#fullsolution&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;jump down to the end&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; and copy-paste my final solution! But if you’re interested in how I got there, read on.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Searching the internet was my first task, but unfortunately I couldn’t find exactly what I needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48400966/access-kubernetes-gke-cluster-outside-of-gke-cluster-with-client-go&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; I found on the subject suggested, as one possible solution, bundling the &lt;code&gt;gcloud&lt;/code&gt; binary with my service, and having my service literally run &lt;code&gt;gcloud container clusters&lt;/code&gt; at runtime. I found that idea problematic:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bundling &lt;code&gt;gcloud &lt;/code&gt;would add significant complication to the service image build; I’d be going off rails from the streamlined build process we already have in place for Go services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invoking &lt;code&gt;gcloud &lt;/code&gt;is ultimately a stateful operation in the container; I wouldn’t be able to write encapsulated code and forget about it, or analyze multiple clusters in parallel without worrying about mutable config state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The second &lt;a href=&quot;https://goteleport.com/blog/kubectl-gke/&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; I found suggested producing a valid &lt;code&gt;~/.kube/config&lt;/code&gt; file in advance, bundling it with my service, and using that to connect to various kube clusters. That didn’t work for me either; I wanted my service to be fully dynamic, not something I’d have to rebuild and redeploy whenever we added or removed a cluster. But the article did give me an idea...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digging deeper into the library code&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If all I needed was a valid &lt;code&gt;~/.kube/config&lt;/code&gt;, then ultimately I just needed to see &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; the information in &lt;code&gt;~/.kube/config&lt;/code&gt; was used in the Go library code, and try to reproduce the same behavior in memory. With that in mind, I went diving into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;code&gt;k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd/api&lt;/code&gt; to see what was going on under the hood. I soon discovered that &lt;code&gt;k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd/api.Config&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Is the Go type that represents &lt;code&gt;~/.kube/config&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;clientcmd.NewNonInteractiveClientConfig&lt;/code&gt;. These would be the key to creating a usable &lt;code&gt;kubernetes.Interface&lt;/code&gt; to a particular cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Trial and Error&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;My process for getting there was fairly straightforward, if a bit trial-and-error. My idea was to see if I could produce a valid &lt;code&gt;~/.kube/config&lt;/code&gt; that &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; would accept and successfully operate with. I figured if I could do that, I’d be most of the way there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I used a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/container/v1#Service&quot;&gt;google.golang.org/api/container/v1.Service&lt;/a&gt;, calling &lt;code&gt;svc.Projects.Zones.Clusters.List&lt;/code&gt; for the GCP project id I was interested in, and using &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; as the zone. This returned a list of all the k8s clusters in a given project, and blessedly included all of the information I’d need to construct my &lt;code&gt;clientcmd/api.Config&lt;/code&gt;. I then iterated on my code, dumping the resulting config to disk and comparing it to my existing &lt;code&gt;~/.kube/config&lt;/code&gt; that &lt;code&gt;gcloud container clusters&lt;/code&gt; had produced. Eventually, I was able to produce a minimal &lt;code&gt;~/.kube/config&lt;/code&gt; that &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; itself could actually use to successfully run:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Constructing the &lt;code&gt;kubernetes.Interface&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once I got the config working for &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;, I needed to get it working in Go. It wasn’t too hard to stitch together the right construction:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;CurrentContext&lt;/code&gt; bit is part of what makes the encapsulation work well, I can specify the active cluster I want per k8s client, but the general config is immutable and can be shared across any number of k8s clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Last missing piece: GCP auth plugin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;My first attempt failed with this error: &lt;code&gt;no Auth Provider found for name &amp;quot;gcp&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Thankfully, this time around the internet gave me exactly what I needed (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/issues/242&quot;&gt;https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/issues/242&lt;/a&gt;). All I needed to do was add a magic import to wire up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/plugin/pkg/client/auth/gcp&quot;&gt;gcp auth provider&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As soon as I added that import, everything suddenly worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Full solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To put it all together, here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/dragonsinth/aea365732b60da3adc928dc18fff56ed&quot;&gt;fully working sample&lt;/a&gt;, a simple Go binary you can run even on your local machine. (You just need to &lt;code&gt;gcloud auth login&lt;/code&gt; and then try to connect to a GCP project you have access to.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sample output:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I hope you find this solution useful!

And sometimes, like now, that pause takes the shape of an informal “Year in Review,” if you will. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of course, 2020’s review is far less straightforward than in times past. While there were many milestones to cheer (like recording our 20 billionth session), we also needed to retune how we delivered value to our customers in the face of major world events–events that brought digital experience into an even brighter spotlight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Through all of the year’s challenges, we’ve held onto our core belief that &lt;i&gt;everyone benefits from a more perfect digital experience&lt;/i&gt;, and have remained dedicated to continuously improving the FullStory platform for our current and future customers (and, in turn, for our customers&amp;#x27; visitors). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over the past 12 months, the team here has &lt;i&gt;Moved with Urgency&lt;/i&gt; to roll out new and updated features including tools to better visualize and quantify user behavior, enhanced analytics capabilities, additional privacy controls, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For all of its tumult, it’s nice to be able to say that 2020 was a year of real forward motion for the FullStory platform. Here’s a quick look back at some of the product highlights from the year that we think deliver on our promise of value to you, our customers: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative and quantitative insights at your fingertips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Enhanced analytics capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We rolled out  a new and improved suite of quantitative analysis features—including &lt;b&gt;Dashboards&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Metrics&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Defined Events&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Funnels&lt;/b&gt;. Our 2021 resolution? To continue building ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/session-replay-elevates-qualitative-analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;pair qualitative and quantitative insights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; together, so you can have the full story of the digital customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Visibility below the fold&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;New ways to visualize and quantify customer behavior &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You now have even more ways to understand how customers are navigating your site or application with enhanced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/scroll-maps&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scroll Maps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; These heatmaps–designed specifically to show how far visitors scroll down lengthy pages–let you visualize customers’ awareness of features or elements that fall below the fold. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/user-experience-issues-by-revenue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revenue Opportunities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Conversions allows you to easily quantify the potential revenue gain from fixing issues that create barriers for customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
User data Private by Default&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Additional privacy and team controls &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Safeguarding the privacy of your visitors across your applications and sites has become a critical component of protecting your brand and maintaining your customers’ trust. That’s why we’ve added more first-to-market options for controlling &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; data FullStory collects, and &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; within your company can access that data. All FullStory customers now have access to &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623574-How-do-I-protect-my-users-privacy-in-FullStory-#mask-fs-mask&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Element Masking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to block sensitive user data from being gathered, without sacrificing your ability to run analysis on those masked elements. Further, organizations on our Enterprise plan now have a &lt;b&gt;new &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624774-What-user-roles-are-available-for-FullStory-teammates-#for-enterprise-plans-you-may-also-create-an-architect-user-seat&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Architect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; role&lt;/b&gt;, so those users can access important data definition workflows while keeping the most sensitive privacy and security settings accessible to Admins only. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Making technology work for you&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connecting FullStory to your DX stack&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we build tools that empower our customers to get the most possible value from their digital experience data—both in and outside of the FullStory platform. Many companies invest significant effort in building a data layer that tracks custom events and user variables, so we built a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057598393-Data-Layer-Observer&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data Layer Observer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that automatically pulls this custom information into FullStory in just a few clicks. We also know that DX data from FullStory is even more valuable when shared across your tech stack. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045134554-Webhooks&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Webhooks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Data Export Segmentation, Ragehooks, and a Productboard integration, sharing FullStory data between integrated platforms is easier than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;And so much more...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a feature or item in your application that you &lt;i&gt;expect&lt;/i&gt; users to click rapidly?

All data presented is from FullStory&amp;#x27;s original research, &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The State of Digital Experience 2020: Mapping a Path to Digital Experience Maturity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies depend heavily on customer retention. For most SaaS businesses, the focus on earning loyalty from existing customers is just as important as bringing in new ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s been widely noted that acquiring a new customer can be anywhere from five to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one. By those numbers, even a small reduction in churn percentage can serve to greatly increase a company’s revenue over time. In fact, research conducted by Frederick Reichheld of Bain &amp;amp; Company shows that increasing customer retention rates by just five percent can &lt;a href=&quot;https://media.bain.com/Images/BB_Prescription_cutting_costs.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;increase profits by 25 percent to 95 percent. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Retaining existing customers is even more critical today given many budget shrinkages triggered by the global pandemic. SaaS teams may not have the budget required to invest in new features or products that could attract new clients, making customer retention even more critical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To help safeguard customer retention, successful SaaS companies are putting more emphasis on the digital customer experience. This experience is about each customer’s perception of a company, brand and product, based on all the digital interactions the customer has with the company across every channel and device. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, offering a great digital experience (DX) is nearly synonymous with remaining competitive in your space.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/us/en/advisory-services/publications/consumer-intelligence-series/pwc-consumer-intelligence-series-customer-experience.pdf#page=8&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;PWC found that 32 percent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the people they polled would stop doing business with a brand or company they’d previously loved after just one bad experience. For SaaS companies, a great DX strategy can help pave the way to meeting customers’ needs and expectations, and create a competitive advantage that drives customer retention over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what actions can SaaS DX pros take to achieve greater digital experience maturity? Below, we outline &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;research-backed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; guidelines to help you drive long-term DX success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use technology to proactively surface and reduce DX friction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To make confident digital experience decisions—for example, which product fixes or improvements to prioritize—your organization needs a complete view of the customer’s digital experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our research shows that fewer than half (46 percent) of digital experience professionals have full visibility into causes of user frustration. More mature organizations are much more likely (146 percent) to “agree” or “strongly agree” that they have full visibility into sources of digital user friction and frustration than less mature organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And it’s not only the numbers that are important, but the context behind them–and because SaaS companies can’t rely on face-to-face customer interactions, they have to go the extra mile to gain that context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a DX pro, you may have access to oodles of quantitative data, but you need to add qualitative data as well in order to validate your hypotheses and assumptions. This combination gives you the ability to understand both &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; users are doing on your site or app and &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; they’re doing it. An effective tech stack will proactively surface where issues lie in the customer journey, the scale of those issues, and what’s causing them. Then, you need to be proactive in addressing those DX challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your team’s budget has been tightened over the past year, you will also need to find ways to access this data efficiently with fewer resources, which means tools that lower the barrier to entry are key. Leveraging tools &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;like FullStory&lt;/a&gt; that can capture and analyze both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/session-replay-elevates-qualitative-analytics&quot;&gt;quantitative and qualitative DX data&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to save time and money while creating a better digital experience for your users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You also want to ensure the tech you’re using can provide deep, &lt;i&gt;actionable&lt;/i&gt; insights. It’s one thing to see that there’s an issue, but how do you determine how significant that problem is? How do you decide how many resources to dedicate to it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your tech stack should simultaneously highlight where issues happen along the customer’s journey, the impact of those issues at scale, and the root causes of those issues. Source technologies that automatically surface your most important opportunities for improvement and proactively point you toward a course of action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In short, look for technologies that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide a complete view of the customer’s digital experience &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speak to each other and integrate seamlessly &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovate and improve constantly to better solve the problem they solve &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are easy to use and access, facilitating the dissemination of key customer insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make DX a team effort&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To get a clear view of the digital experience, take a step back from traditional product development and consider other areas of the company. Our research revealed that more mature digital experience organizations are 68 percent more likely to report that they structure teams cross-functionally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to improving the customer’s digital experience, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/cross-functional-collaboration/&quot;&gt;cross-functional teams&lt;/a&gt; can be beneficial for many reasons. Because they are often organized around a specific mission—improving a particular customer journey or product experience, for example—the customer’s experience is more likely to be at the forefront. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And because cross-functional teams bring together individual contributors with a variety of necessary skills sets, they can move quickly from insight to customer value. A team structured in this way can lead to improved decision-making, creative problem-solving, and a de-siloing of relevant information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fix DX problems quickly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For SaaS companies, knowing that a digital customer experience issue exists is only half the battle. The next crucial step is creating a process to prioritize fixes for found issues. According to our research, more mature digital experience organizations are more likely to report being able to easily prioritize digital fixes and improvements and quickly ship digital fixes and improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In fact, 78 percent of more mature organizations report that they are currently able to quickly ship fixes and features based on customer learnings, compared to just 35 percent of less mature organizations. That’s important, because the longer it takes to fix a customer’s problem, the more likely they are to turn to one of your competitors for their software needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Develop and foster customer empathy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To deliver a more perfect digital experience, you need to develop customer empathy. There are many ways to do this, such as speaking directly with customers, observing customers as they try to use your products, reading customer reviews and feedback, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The key is to achieve customer empathy at scale–to make it an organizational habit to ‘walk a mile in your customers’ shoes. The ability to understand the “why” behind customer frustration is vital to creating customer empathy–and delivering delightful digital experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because SaaS companies exist online by nature, it’s even more crucial for you to seek out ways to get up close to the customer journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The right technologies can support you here as well. Organizations that report being able to “always” or “often” deliver a great digital experience are 47 percent more likely to report that they can easily understand why their users are feeling frustrated within their digital experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The closer individuals at your organization can get to the customer experience, the more easily they’ll be able to empathize with customers’ struggles and needs. This is an area where a platform that offers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can come in handy–and save time. Watching real users navigate (or struggle to navigate) your site or app is a great way for non-customer facing team members to see and empathize with how users are feeling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ultimately, reducing customer churn should be at the top of the agenda for any business, but it’s especially important for SaaS companies. Competition is fierce and just a click away. Prioritizing the digital experience can create loyal customers and, even better, customer advocates. Organizations that stay focused on the person behind the digital interaction are not only able to deliver better digital experiences, they are also more profitable in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FullStory helps your organization raise the bar on digital experience maturity. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Request a demo today.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating scalable, testable, and readable React apps: Part 3]]></title><description><![CDATA[Should you separate React components into different categories?

If we’re not careful, it’s easy to  stop short and just have “strong opinions.” But ensuring that those strong opinions are “loosely held” creates a greater ability for us to change, grow, and learn. In this final article of the series on how we architect our React apps at FullStory, we will see how loosely holding our strong opinions about React architecture enables us to embrace the benefits and iterate on the downsides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But first, let’s do a quick review. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/creating-scalable-testable-and-readable-react-apps-part-2&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Part Two&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of this series we proposed three categories of React components that our React apps should be composed of: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Views are responsible for defining the layout and routing of a page or section of a page &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Containers are responsible for passing data (possibly fetched asynchronously) or state to its children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Components are responsible for rendering the UI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Part Two also mentions that containers and components aren’t new concepts—they’ve actually been around for a while now. However, as React has changed, these concepts have grown controversial. So, let’s dive in and take a look at the pros and cons to architecting our app using the three categories of components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pros of component categories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Testability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/creating-scalable-testable-and-readable-react-apps-part-1&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Part One&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the series, we talked about how important the testability of a React component is. We gave an example of a React &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jcarroll2007/1cb61a6d9742533a3781369a067a43f4#file-starwarscharacters-multipleresponsibilities-jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;component that was difficult to test&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Without our component categories, it’s easy to get into a state where you have to mock a lot of things before you can actually test logical sections of your component. This can lead to complex and brittle tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When we use the single responsibility principle and apply our component categories, each type of component category maps well to a specific type of test. Since our components render UI as a function of their props, we can very easily write unit tests to verify our user’s experience without having to mock any providers. At the view and container level we can then write meaningful integration tests to verify that larger parts of the app work as expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the gist below we are testing a component, the &lt;code&gt;CharacterCreateForm&lt;/code&gt;, and a container, the &lt;code&gt;CharacterListContainer&lt;/code&gt;. The component test could be considered a unit test. It’s testing a small piece of functionality very specific to the UX we expect, namely that &lt;code&gt;onSubmit&lt;/code&gt; is not called unless a name is provided. On the other hand, the container test can then focus on testing the integration between the API layer code and the UI components it renders. If we tried to write similar tests using the example component from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/creating-scalable-testable-and-readable-react-apps-part-1/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Part One&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of this series, our tests would be less focused and more brittle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Check out the links below for more examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcarroll2007/react-architecture-example/blob/master/src/components/CharacterCreateForm/__tests__/index.tsx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Component tests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcarroll2007/react-architecture-example/blob/master/src/containers/CharacterList/__tests__/index.test.tsx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Container tests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mental debugging flow chart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One of the key benefits of this architecture is how the process of elimination makes finding bugs in our code much easier. If we find a bug, it’s usually pretty easy to answer the question, “Is this a UI bug, is this a bug with how we’re fetching or manipulating data, or is this a bug with the layout or routing of the page?” By using this mental debugging flow chart we can easily eliminate large sections of our code that we know probably aren’t related, which allows us to narrow down where that bug might live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consistency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, several different teams work on different verticals of our React application. One of our company values is that we “win (or lose) together,” so it’s not uncommon to dive into code in a vertical that isn’t technically owned by your team. Having a consistent and clearly defined architecture allows engineers to easily jump from one vertical to another with a sense of familiarity and understanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fosters individual creativity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As engineers, we often express our internal uniqueness and creativity in the ways we solve problems through writing code. We can look at the code we write as our own unique mental fingerprint. Using our component categories allows us to benefit from code consistency across our organization at a macro level, and fosters individuality and creativity at the micro level. This means that anyone writing react code can easily move from team to team and understand generally how the code is structured, and at the same time feel the freedom to write their component, container, view, hook, etc. while fostering their individual creative freedom at that level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Foundation for future React patterns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, this architecture was designed to consider and support future React patterns. Consider code splitting and data fetching. We can easily &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;lazily load&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; our container components and provide meaningful loading UI states for these async actions. This also prepares us for logical points to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suspense&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;u&gt; for data fetching&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when React is ready for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cons of component categories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Scalability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The main argument against grouping components by category is that it lacks scalability. This can be true without adding further context. Over time, as your app grows in complexity, simply splitting components into categories like this without further categorization does break down. Avoiding naming collisions and finding components becomes difficult as the application grows. At FullStory we have thousands of React components. So, this is a problem we certainly would have faced by now if we only had a few directories for these different categories of components. However, this is not the way our application is broken down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over time, an application, vertical, or feature can become complex enough that, no matter how well you plan, these kinds of problems can arise. So, that’s just a fact that we accept and expect. For now, in our monorepo, we have packages that correspond to different verticals of our application. If that vertical is complex enough, we might create another directory in that package that might have sub-verticals. When that breaks down, we then split the sub-verticals out into their own packages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our FullStory settings “page” is a great example of this. It’s a single vertical of our application, technically, but it is composed of many rather complex pages. Below is an example of what our directory structure looks like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;settings&lt;/code&gt; directory is a local private npm module in our monorepo that contains all of the code responsible for rendering the settings UI. Inside of that directory we have a &lt;code&gt;domains&lt;/code&gt; directory that contains the sub pages in our settings app. In this example we have the &lt;code&gt;integrations&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;users&lt;/code&gt; directories which correspond to our &lt;code&gt;integrations&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;users&lt;/code&gt; settings pages. Our directory structure in these domain directories looks exactly like the Settings directory does. Let’s say we get to the point where the &lt;code&gt;users&lt;/code&gt; page begins to become complex enough to warrant its own &lt;code&gt;domains&lt;/code&gt; directory—at that time it probably makes sense to break it off into its own package, which would actually be quite easy given that it’s largely self-contained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In short, grouping React code by feature first and component category second can help prepare for the inevitable change of our React apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Imperfect component boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sometimes our UI can be so complex  that we reach a point where it seems like our component categories fail to support what we actually need to build. I like to approach this problem in two stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First, while it may seem like a “cheap” answer, I “think harder.” Over time, as I’ve grown to appreciate the benefits of these categories, my trust in the categories has grown too. Sometimes composing your components in new ways can create cleaner boundaries and isolate responsibilities—even if at first it doesn’t seem possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In fairness, “think harder” isn’t always the answer. So secondly, in certain cases these boundaries can fail to support our needs or lead to unnecessarily complex component trees or prop interfaces. If this happens, the best thing to do is throw away everything you’ve built and start from scratch. No! Just kidding of course. It’s 100% acceptable to break the “rules” that aren’t really “rules,” after all. Since we only hold loosely to our strong opinions, it’s ok to do things differently when necessary. We do still want to write consistently architected code, but sometimes we do have to break from that. If we still adhere to the principle of single responsibility and write composable and testable React components, though, we can still have many of the benefits we have talked about&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hooks?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’ve seen some arguments that hooks make component categories like views, containers, and components unnecessary. However, hooks themselves can also fall into the categories of routing/layout, async actions, or UI. At FullStory, we still find it useful to separate concerns, like async actions, routing, or UI, into these component categories even if the logic is contained in hooks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, some of our internal component library components (pure UI components) use hooks to share UI functionality like keyboard accessibility. This still falls under the category of UI. In our containers, we often have hooks that fetch data and return async state properties which our containers then use to conditionally render UI (loading spinners, skeleton states, or actual components if the data is ready). Hooks, in our opinion, don’t make these boundaries unnecessary; they’re a completely different tool in our tool belt that improve our developer experience in different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are two things I hope you take away from this series of articles. First, by separating our React components into distinct categories, we truly can improve the scalability, testability, and readability of our React apps. Secondly, by loosely holding to these strong opinions we can iterate and ultimately “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/suck-less-cycle/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;suck less&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’ve enjoyed this series on how we write React code at FullStory and love solving complex engineering problems, come join our team! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/careers/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;We’re hiring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[FullStory Spotlight: The engineers behind our mobile platform]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this FullStory Spotlight our mobile engineering team shares why they love working at FullStory and what advice they would give to other engineers.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-engineers-behind-our-mobile-platform</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-engineers-behind-our-mobile-platform</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rachel Roller]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While we’ve previously written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/mobile-app-analytics-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the making of our mobile experience intelligence platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rust-at-fullstory-part-1-why-rust&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;why we chose to use Rust&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, now we want to introduce some of the innovators behind our cross-platform mobile framework. With varied backgrounds and a blend of Android, Rust, Go, iOS, and web frontend knowledge, the team is united by their passion for building privacy-sensitive, exceptionally crafted, and intuitive libraries to help app developers and their users. We asked some members of the team to reflect on their work, their team, and share their sage advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From left to right: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuaawise/&quot;&gt;Joshua Wise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanfriedly/&quot;&gt;Nathan Friedly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/prashanth-sadasivan-25aba223/&quot;&gt;Prashanth Sadasivan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ted-mielczarek-3376b1181/&quot;&gt;Ted Mielczarek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What makes working on FullStory&amp;#x27;s mobile technology stack uniquely interesting to you? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prashanth:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a truly novel technology. I&amp;#x27;ve done lots of web and app development at different startups, and while they can be challenging, I think working on FullStory for Mobile Apps has pressed me to expand what I think is &amp;quot;possible&amp;quot;, and to challenge my assumptions at a fundamental level. Usually the problems I&amp;#x27;m accustomed to solving have to do with making improvements, or dealing with accidental complexity, but what I find exciting (and at times daunting too!) is often the problems I&amp;#x27;m working on have to do with figuring out whether something is actually possible or not. Thanks to the nature of that kind of work, I feel like I&amp;#x27;ve grown as an engineer at a much more accelerated pace.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joshua:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;I really enjoy the diversity of technologies that I can get to use, and how the work calls on the breadth of my skill set. To track down a session replay bug, in the morning, I might open a PDF in a text editor; I might then open UIKit in a disassembler to look for how an API is used; in the afternoon, I&amp;#x27;ll read some of our Objective-C; and then I&amp;#x27;ll end my day by making a surgical change in some TypeScript to get a customer a fix that they don&amp;#x27;t even have to update their plugin for.  Talk about rewarding! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Which team accomplishments or milestones are you most proud to be a part of?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ted:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;There&amp;#x27;s not one big thing I would point to as being most proud of, it&amp;#x27;s all the little parts of team cohesion that make me proud to be involved. We&amp;#x27;ve done such a great job working together to address customer issues, improve the quality of the product, and also improve the processes we use to get things done so that we can keep shipping a great product without sacrificing our own quality of life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nathan:&lt;/u&gt; I&lt;i&gt;&amp;#x27;m really proud of our stance on privacy, the way you can get a feel for what&amp;#x27;s happening in an app and where the sticking points are without needing any personal information about the user.  Also, the fact that it works at all is a little magical.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What drew you to FullStory and why do you stay?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prashanth:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;The team. At most other companies, I&amp;#x27;ve had a tough time really being a company evangelist, or recommending that my friends or close coworkers come work for the company I&amp;#x27;m joining. But FullStory&amp;#x27;s team and company culture has been a real revelation. It&amp;#x27;s honest, it&amp;#x27;s nerdy, it&amp;#x27;s welcoming, across the whole company, and specifically on my team as well. I feel like I&amp;#x27;ve learned what my &amp;quot;North Star&amp;quot; is for a team culture.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ted:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;I was invited to interview and the company culture impressed me so much, as well as the amazing people working here that it felt like a place where I could do interesting work with a bunch of great colleagues. I&amp;#x27;ve come to really enjoy how much FullStory customers love our product, and the working environment was as great as I imagined. Everyone here understands we&amp;#x27;re on the same team and wants to help each other so that we can ship a great product that our customers will continue to love, while also recognizing that we&amp;#x27;re all human and treating each other with compassion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nathan:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;It feels like I fit in more than anywhere else I&amp;#x27;ve ever worked. Also, FullStory strikes a good balance of being a place where I can do work that I&amp;#x27;m proud of during the day and still have time for myself and my family in the evenings.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joshua:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;i&gt; A lot of organizations have core values that they talk about, but that don&amp;#x27;t come into practice all that often.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;FullStory&amp;#x27;s Watchwords&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; -- clarity, empathy, and bionics -- are &amp;quot;everyday foods&amp;quot;, and the culture that surrounds them comes from the very top of the company.  Engineers at FullStory are empowered to speak up when we fall short of one of these, and as a result, we hold ourselves to a high standard -- and it comes through in how customers experience us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What are some similarities/differences between your current team and previous teams?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prashanth:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;A lot of the similarities are the best practices in software development - automated deployments, sprints and iterating on features, services (that actually make sense to be services).  I think a lot of the key differences at FullStory come from how Engineering lives our company Watchwords - Clarity, Empathy and Bionics. FullStory has a bigger emphasis on communication and documentation than I&amp;#x27;ve worked with in the past. I also think it helps that many engineers have a similar &amp;quot;leave things better than when I arrived&amp;quot; mindset. It&amp;#x27;s easy for companies to say that&amp;#x27;s how they operate, but I&amp;#x27;ve found it to be more true at FullStory. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ted:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve never worked at a company where a healthy culture was so thoroughly ingrained from the top down that everyone really believed in it. There&amp;#x27;s nobody I&amp;#x27;ve encountered at FullStory that I&amp;#x27;d be hesitant to work with because they&amp;#x27;re toxic or working for their own success at the expense of others. That feels really great!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nathan&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;i&gt;This was my first time doing any significant work in Rust, Go, TypeScript, or Objective-C. There is a much higher emphasis on clarity here, but not in a micromanaging sort of way.  I have more autonomy here than most of my previous roles. The weekly company-wide meeting with toasts and demos and whatnot is awesome. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is the best advice you have ever received?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prashanth&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;i&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a bit cliche, but Patrick McKenzie&amp;#x27;s blog has extremely valuable advice. I first read some of his pieces when I was in college and I didn&amp;#x27;t really buy into some of his assertions and felt like parts didn&amp;#x27;t apply to me. But after joining a few different companies, learning more about the startup/corporate world, it amazed me just how spot-on a lot of his observations are. Here’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;my favorite one&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; that I come back to.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ted:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;Be open to new experiences. You never know where you&amp;#x27;ll find yourself when you stay open to trying something new!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nathan:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;Focus on delivering.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joshua:&lt;/u&gt; &lt;i&gt;There are many smart people out there.  Differentiate yourself by being kind&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Interested in learning more?

From consumer-facing retail, travel, professional services, communication, or finance to SaaS, online is where critical decisions are made and meaningful engagement occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yet what actually happens online — that is, the experiences had by users and customers — is often concealed within a black box. Even powerful tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/analytics&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; only provide simple, rudimentary metrics like clicks, bounce rates, and time on page. These &lt;a href=&quot;/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantitative data&lt;/a&gt; and metrics fail to convey all the nuances of human behavior, yet it’s those nuances that help developers reproduce bugs, designers understand and improve UX, customer support professionals step-in and help customers in need, and marketers tell compelling product stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For an in-depth look at session replay, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;/session-replay/&quot;&gt;Definitive Guide to Session Replay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is where one of FullStory’s powerful capabilities, Session Replay, can help you combine the quantitative with the qualitative for richer user insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Session replay (a.k.a. user replay, session recording, or session playback) provides the nuance of empathy.&lt;/b&gt; If you&amp;#x27;re unfamiliar with session replay, it is a recreation of a user’s interactions on a website or web application. Importantly, it&amp;#x27;s not a video recording.  Rather, session replay transforms logged user events—such as mouse movements, clicks, page visits, scrolling, or tapping,—into a reproduction of what the user did on the site or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This ability to view recreations of user sessions gives digital teams the qualitative insights about customer behaviors they need to build better, more customer-centric products that improve the digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How does session replay help, exactly? Consider these examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solve bugs faster with session replay by tying session links with bug reporting tools and customer support tickets.&lt;/b&gt; Search for sessions that contain “error clicks” (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.fullstory.com/cookbook-engineering-bugs/finding-clicks-that-lead-to-console-errors&quot;&gt;when a user click results in a JavaScript console error&lt;/a&gt;). Pairing session recordings with console logs makes for a powerful way to eliminate JavaScript errors on your site.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measure and understand feature adoption with session replay by watching sessions from real users who engaged with the new feature.&lt;/b&gt; Additionally, if your session replay tool includes a way to identify individual visitors (like FullStory’s does), you can export the user information (CSV list) needed to conduct a follow-up email marketing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understand and improve onboarding.&lt;/b&gt; Watch sessions of users who go through onboarding flows and understand where onboarding is falling flat or users are failing to engage.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analyze the effectiveness of online advertising.&lt;/b&gt; Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.fullstory.com/using-ref/marketing-campaign&quot;&gt;UTM parameters and referral sources&lt;/a&gt;, session replay can help marketing teams understand how users from different advertising campaigns are reacting to landing pages and other marketing collateral. Team members can watch sessions for specific signs of engagement. Another valuable application (That could save you money!) is to see how many paid visits stay less than 5 seconds (for example) or longer than 30 seconds. Use the results to understand which advertising sources are driving quality traffic — and which are sending bots, mismatched audiences, or low-relevance clicks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Design and improve user experience (UX).&lt;/b&gt; Session replay is a useful tool for gathering user experience research on-demand and “&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/zenstores-puts-fullstory-to-work-for-support-ui-and-marketing/&quot;&gt;at scale&lt;/a&gt;” to help designers see where elements aren’t being understood or how different devices, screen resolutions, and browsers are presenting an experience to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discover and watch user frustration.&lt;/b&gt; Because a session replay tool logs all visitor interactions, it also picks up signals that indicate user frustration. For example, FullStory finds &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/a&gt; — and create Rage Click &lt;a href=&quot;/heatmap/&quot;&gt;heatmaps&lt;/a&gt; — which is when users click repeatedly on specific elements. These sessions can be watched to determine if the user is misunderstanding some aspect of the web site design.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discover and watch sessions that include form abandonment.&lt;/b&gt; Similar to Rage Clicks, platforms like FullStory that include session replay have form analytics that find when users abandon a form on your web site or app. Watching sessions that include form abandonment can help discover if certain aspects of the form were dissuading completion — or if some problem is occurring as users navigate the form fields.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detect suspicious activity. &lt;/b&gt;SQL injection attacks, URL attacks, and cross-site scripting (XSS) are methods malicious actors might use to hack your site. While not all session replay tools can detect and report on these activities, FullStory can. Searching for and watching sessions that include suspected suspicious activity can reveal if malicious actors are trying to affect your web site or app. More on suspicious activity detection &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.fullstory.com/using-ref/suspicious-activity-overview&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See how users interact with dynamic web app states.&lt;/b&gt; E.g. pop-ups, lightbox, dropdown menus, endlessly scrolling pages, or whatever dynamic content lives on your site. These dynamic states can be difficult to understand with more traditional analytics tools, but FullStory’s session replay function is designed to handle them seamlessly.  For that matter, with tools like FullStory’s Page Insights and Click Maps, you can see aggregated metrics against these dynamic app or page states (More on &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/introducing-page-insights-with-click-maps-and-inspect-mode/&quot;&gt;Click Maps here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/how-to-use-click-maps-for-analysis-of-user-interactions-on-your-web-app/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In some instances, session replay can act as legal evidence&lt;/b&gt;. Because user session recording is high-fidelity, capturing everything, it can be used to prove that a user did something specific.

It’s great to be able to show the delta between hits, conversions, and so on, but it’s missing a deeper element. For example, tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/DXI-fullstory-google-analytics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are great at showing these quantitative metrics, but come up short in answering &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; bounce rate is high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That said, the more qualitative or quantitative data teams gather from disparate tools, the more pressing the need to minimize risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re evaluating privacy in your current stack of digital experience tools, follow these five steps to see if you’re employing current best practices—or if it’s time to make the leap to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 1: Review current and desired analytics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Consider how your organization’s website or mobile app serves up information to users. The most obvious output in the browser is the content itself—the text and images a browser shows a visitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What many users don’t pay attention to, but are just as critical to product managers and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/engineers-guide-dxi/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;engineers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is the behind-the-scenes information: the messages printed to the browser’s console, communication with internal and external services, or semi-structured data that resides in the markup of your application and data layer, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This technical surface area has historically been the exclusive domain of developers. Unlike traditional analytics that require manual instrumentation, modern platforms &lt;i&gt;automatically&lt;/i&gt; monitor this input and output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, modern digital experience tools can log both visible and behind-the-scenes data through non-technical configuration. This ultimately provides a much more complete data set and alleviates the need for business users to rely on developers, allowing them to conduct self-guided investigations as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re evaluating the privacy capabilities of a digital experience platform, first review what data is captured by the platform, and make note of any initial privacy considerations. Often, data capture is configurable, which promotes the ability to maintain user privacy and support a valuable business case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider the following areas of your website or mobile app and configurable data capture scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 2: Identify a default level of privacy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
With a broader understanding of digital experience platforms’ privacy capabilities, the next step is to identify and articulate the privacy needs of your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While a simplistic example, a company that offers online piano lessons has a different perspective on privacy than one managing million-dollar brokerage transactions. Both are critical, but some businesses ingest more private information than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For modern digital intelligence tools, the clarity of qualitative information logged has several levels, providing a spectrum of information:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unmasked&lt;/b&gt; formatting provides the highest level of fidelity—recording the experience exactly as the user saw it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Masked&lt;/b&gt; content provides a middle ground in which text and images are irreversibly redacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exclusion&lt;/b&gt; ensures the highest level of privacy where nothing is recorded or transmitted to the DXI platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Where your organization sits on this privacy spectrum is a matter of how much content requires a given level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A general guideline is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customer-story/ecommerce-retail/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ecommerce websites&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lean more toward the unmasked end of the spectrum. This is because most content is product-related and customer-related data is contained within well defined flows, such as login and checkout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversely, a human resources-focused SaaS website or mobile app skews toward the completely masked end of the spectrum, with elements selectively unmasked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While all organizations will likely end up with partially masked content, knowing the direction your organization leans will ultimately aid a platform’s implementation and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 3: Align content with privacy preferences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With an idea of where your organization’s needs are on the privacy spectrum, the next step is to document privacy preferences regarding the information that exists &lt;i&gt;within&lt;/i&gt; your website or mobile app at the desired level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many teams find success working with a stoplight chart that can be used to classify data and align it to a given privacy level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tactically, this process may require stepping through key user journeys or the pages and screens of your website or mobile app. Doing so helps teams understand the types of information that exist in the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fortunately, most websites or mobile apps have common design artifacts: a login screen, an account page, landing pages, detail pages, checkout, confirmation, and so on. Investigate representative examples of design artifacts and pay close attention to any with a transactional nature (e.g. checkout).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The output should be a set of high-level guidelines and content examples that digital experience platform business owners can use to configure recording behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 4: Create a balanced privacy implementation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
By this step, you’ve reviewed your website or mobile application, have documented privacy preferences, and aligned critical pages with the levels of privacy needed. Next, assess how best to implement privacy in each location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Privacy levels can be applied through two approaches:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Code-first&lt;/b&gt;, which entails adding details into your website or mobile app so the platform applies the desired privacy level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In-app&lt;/b&gt;, where rules are created by end users of the platform and rely on the structure or information already within your website or mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
These two approaches cater to different personas and levels of maintenance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code-first changes are made by developers to the application itself. While this creates tight coupling between your application with desired privacy settings, it requires active participation from development teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-app rules allow end users to define privacy settings that are stored within the platform. In-app rules leverage the structure of a website or mobile app to apply privacy behavior. And, because that structure may change over time, it’s possible that these rules could be reverted through application development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
The two approaches are, however, not mutually exclusive. In-app privacy rules provide an immediate, effective solution. Combined with periodic reviews, stable in-app rules can be transferred into the application’s code base using the code-first approach. This act of privacy hardening transfers validated rules into long-term privacy protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 5: Create a culture of privacy stewardship&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After initial implementation, privacy maintenance is supported by various roles throughout the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Business owners&lt;/b&gt; typically act as platform administrators. Administrators have the sole ability to adjust privacy levels. Consequently, they must know how to carry out privacy adjustments and understand the cross-organization effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product managers&lt;/b&gt; provide tactical recommendations related to privacy. These recommendations are informed through upcoming feature changes and ongoing development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;b&gt;developers&lt;/b&gt; have a less active role in instrumenting analytics, they should be mindful of software development best practices: class names, identifiers, or data attributes, and others. These help increase the compatibility between the digital experience tool and the organization’s application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;b&gt;end users&lt;/b&gt; of a platform should have a clear understanding of the organization’s privacy preferences and a clear process to request changes to business owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In closing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
As you compare digital experience analytics tools and assess each using this five-part process, you’ll find that not all are created equal. For instance, many legacy platforms don’t allow for a spectrum of privacy—additionally, they log PII alongside other data by default, putting user privacy at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence solutions such as FullStory are different. The DXI platform was built to understand user journeys, without sacrificing user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After this process, teams have working practices and documentation for choosing the right tool for using qualitative and quantitative data to improve user experience. And, while privacy is a perpetual, ongoing process, the right tool can automate aspects of the process, freeing up teams’ time for critical work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Schedule your demo of FullStory’s Digital Experience Intelligence solution today&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Decisions aren’t made by hunches, they’re made by statistical proof. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data doesn’t always tell us the exact way to go in every instance. Sometimes, we have to feel our way by running small tests with pinpoint hypotheses. One way to do that is A/B testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411046364823-A-B-Testing-Approaches-in-FullStory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;A/B testing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is all about studying causality by creating two near-identical items and then seeing the effects of how a single change can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is A/B testing? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A/B testing refers to an experimentation technique where two or more versions of a variable are created to determine which version reveals the maximum impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The goal—to drive your key performance metrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Often a part of a conversion rate optimization (&lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/learn/seo/conversion-rate-optimization&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRO)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; strategy, teams conduct A/B tests in order to gather &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;qualitative and quantitative data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to improve actions across the customer journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Even the simplest changes—for instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/20566/the-button-color-a-b-test-red-beats-green.aspx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the color of a button&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—can impact conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How does A/B testing work? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The basic A/B testing process looks like this: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make a hypothesis about one or two changes you think will improve a conversion rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a variation of that with one (and only one) change per variation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divide incoming traffic equally between each variation and the original change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give it some time (depending on your value), then evaluate the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s dig into the ways your team can utilize A/B testing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-intelligence/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (DXI). 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5 ways teams use A/B testing with digital experience  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Testing URLs against each other&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
A common A/B test conducted by many product teams involves building two near-identical pages with unique URLs or &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040770154-Why-do-I-see-redacted-query-parameters-in-FullStory-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;URL query parameters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—and testing them side by side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Let’s say you’d like to test a photo background image on a specific landing page compared to an illustration background image. Your team could then publish two nearly identical pages with one variance between them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;website.com/page1.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;website.com/page2.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Depending on what you’re testing for—conversion rate, time on page, scroll depth, or another other metrics—teams can easily use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; platform to discern a winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Testing elements with Session Replay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re using a DXI tool such as FullStory, it’s simple to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to test elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session Replay shows a complete picture of the user on a website or app. It transforms logged user events, such as mouse clicks, scrolling, tapping—into a reproduction of what the user actually did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In other words, session replay helps you see through your customer’s eyes, literally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can use Session Replay to A/B test critical page functionality, such as: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which landing page version has a longer time-on-page?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which CTA converts more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which featured image works better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Watched elements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Without the right tools, A/B tests can often be limited to comparing “took an action” to “did not take an action”—things that can be easily quantified, such as click-through rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But with DXI, teams can even test what people &lt;i&gt;did not&lt;/i&gt; do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re looking to A/B test users who saw (or did not see) a particular element, this approach via &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034693073-Watched-Elements-Can-I-search-for-CSS-elements-without-a-click-event-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Watched Elements&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is particularly useful. By monitoring if an element rendered on a particular page, and if it was visible in the user’s viewport, it’s simple to test what you think users are seeing vs. what they actually are seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Integrations and A/B testing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By themselves, DXI tools just scratch the surface of A/B testing capabilities. For greater power, pair the qualitative and quantitative data gathered through a DXI platform such as FullStory with integrations with tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://partners.fullstory.com/directory/partner/627876/optimizely&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Optimizely&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Modern digital experience platforms are easily coupled with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you need:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/saas-nps-benchmark/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for survey metrics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slack for cross-functional collaboration and messaging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;JIRA for process and workflow management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And many more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Data Layer Observation rule&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As detailed by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-data-layer-and-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;data layer archives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, most websites and applications have a series of layers: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Presentation layer&lt;/b&gt;—what the website visitor sees, typically built with HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data layer&lt;/b&gt;—the layer for collecting and managing the data produced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Application layer&lt;/b&gt;—all the tools connected to your website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-ads-pixel&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Facebook Pixel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) which are typically &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.javascripttutorial.net/snippets/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;JavaScript snippets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Every website has a presentation layer, and most sites have an application layer, but not every site has a data layer to collect data. When you rely on the presentation layer to collect data, any change you make to your site will impact the data you collect. Small design changes can mean big data problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With DXI, you can write a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-data-layer-and-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data Layer Observer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (DLO) rule and deploy it with a snippet to have the A/B tests come into FullStory. With the DLO you can get a script to add to your site that brings data layer variables into FullStory. All you need to do is add “rules” that decide what variables will be observed. This provides you with a ready-to-use rule for A/B testing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;DXI: The right tool for the job &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We all know that A/B testing can expedite processes involved with optimization—but the right tool for the job is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With these examples of how a DXI solution can help you significantly improve your website’s UX by eliminating weak links and finding the most optimized version of your website—you’re on the right path for A/B testing success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

Unsurprisingly, that gets complicated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atlassian.com/agile&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;agile processes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can keep product, engineering, and UX teams working in lockstep, keeping additional departments on the same page presents a greater challenge for PMs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At this year’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindtheproduct.com/mtpcon/london/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mind the Product conference in London&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, FullStory VP of Product Agata Bugaj answered two big questions for the modern product manager: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the right level of visibility into the product roadmap for marketing, sales, CX, support, and other teams around the organization? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do I provide that visibility in ways that are most conducive to cross-team focus and alignment? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read on for Agata’s sanity-saving ways to use data to keep cross-functional teams in sync by focusing on people, processes, and tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;People: Encouraging clarity and communication&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every department has a different function and different day-to-day priorities, but certain sets of teams tend to align more organically than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, it’s probably easier to get development, UX, and product management teams on the same page because these teams tend to focus on the technical aspects of site experience or development, while  marketing, sales, and customer experience teams might align because they are all outward-facing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These natural groupings present a challenge for product managers who need to create organization-wide cohesion. How should a PM navigate product roadmap conversations with teams that are less closely related to the product itself? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The key is to communicate early and often about product roadmap updates to help each team stay focused and aligned.&lt;/b&gt; Communicating in bite-sized pieces prevents the need for lengthy, in-depth presentations that often result in information overload. We’ll cover more about specific communication methods in the next section. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Need tips for building a prioritized product roadmap? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/product-ideas-into-roadmap/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Here are eight techniques.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Process: Structuring your roadmap updates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Like we mentioned in the previous section, keeping the lines of communication open between teams is key to aligning around the product roadmap. At FullStory, this takes the form of monthly roadmap updates to provide ongoing visibility and status reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are Agata’s tips for making the monthly update effective and digestible: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Release phase-based lists of what’s in &lt;b&gt;alpha, beta, and GA&lt;/b&gt;. This illustrates progress and streamlines go-to-market planning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show a list of&lt;b&gt; items in staging&lt;/b&gt; separately. This builds awareness while distinguishing them as not-yet user-facing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, include &lt;b&gt;discovery items&lt;/b&gt; on the list to create accountability and conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate &lt;b&gt;enhancements&lt;/b&gt; from features. This supports audience-specific communications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dedicated &lt;b&gt;feature slides&lt;/b&gt; are useful for double-clicking into items from the overview and provide additional information as appropriate—such as feature description, KPIs, associated Slack channels, screenshots, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Product managers can also provide &lt;b&gt;weekly release notes&lt;/b&gt; to offer updates on the monthly roadmap. This practice drives alignment on user-facing teams like sales, marketing, and CX. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tools: Collecting digital experience data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/07/24/what-is-data-democratization-a-super-simple-explanation-and-the-key-pros-and-cons/?sh=3044451f6013&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data democratization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; goes a long way toward keeping disparate teams on the same wavelength by providing shared reference points and quantifiable metrics. Democratized data ensures that activities and communications—both within teams and across departments—are powered by the same information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For the most effective understanding and analysis, teams should have access to both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;quantitative and qualitative data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s how these two types of data are used functionally: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quantitative data &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Quantitative data tells you &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; is happening in your product, helping to answer specific questions and influence product outcomes. Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitive-data&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;quantitative data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at your organization creates efficiencies by allowing you to look at large sample sizes and behavioral data in aggregate—generating more insights in less time by analyzing hundreds or thousands of sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This creates almost instant visibility into product issues (or successes) so teams can coordinate and act quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Qualitative data &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qualitative data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows you &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; certain events or behaviors are happening, helping you validate hypotheses and provide direction for next steps. A major strength of qualitative research is that it isn’t bound by the same limitations as quantitative methods; if responses don’t meet a researcher’s expectations, that data adds context to whatever you’re analyzing and might even explain something that numbers alone aren’t able to reveal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For many organizations, qualitative product data comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (DXI) tools and, specifically, session replay—which allows you to watch and analyze the events of every user session in your product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For &lt;b&gt;product managers&lt;/b&gt;, the qualitative data from DXI helps validate numbers while also weeding out the causes of certain user behaviors. Qualitative data generated by session replay has cross-departmental benefits as well:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;•&lt;b&gt;Developers&lt;/b&gt; can generate more user empathy by watching people struggle to do something in the product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Marketers&lt;/b&gt; can analyze the paths users take to conversion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;• &lt;b&gt;Support&lt;/b&gt; professionals can quickly see the context of a reported issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Empowering teams with data &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to be truly in sync, teams across organizations should have democratized access to both types of data to create a complete understanding of the product. This need points to the fact that product managers should ensure that their organization has the right tools in place to generate and distribute the necessary product data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;DXI tools can serve as a one-stop shop for quantitative and qualitative user and product data, creating the transparency that teams need to focus and align on product improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/align-systems-with-DXI/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;here are four ways&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that access to shared data through DXI aligns your teams and systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Quantitative data examples to help you understand how to take action]]></title><description><![CDATA[Quantitative data is used for calculations or obtaining numerical results.

Data can be complicated, and the shortcomings and victories aren’t always apparent—they’re buried in the details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data—specifically quantitative data—is no different. In order to analyze and interpret this data type, you’ll need to understand the nuances, details, and other factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ll cover the basics of quantitative data, quantitative data examples, its different types, use cases, and how to collect it for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;What is quantitative data?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;At its simplest level, quantitative data is information that can be quantified. It’s data that can be counted or measured, and given a numerical value.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Quantitative variables can tell you &amp;quot;how much,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;how many,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;how often.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The different categories of quantitative data include:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measurements, counts, and calculations&lt;/b&gt;: for example, the attendees of a webinar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sensors&lt;/b&gt;: a photosensor detecting the presence of light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quantification of qualitative data&lt;/b&gt;: how a &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/categorical-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;categorical group&lt;/a&gt; of people felt about a quiz. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Projections&lt;/b&gt;: expected revenue for Q4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Knowing what type of quantitative data — also called numerical data — you’re working with helps teams apply the correct type of statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since quantitative data is statistically analyzed and mathematical in nature, research can be extremely detailed. And due to its numerical nature, there’s less potential for bias. The results obtained are objective in nature, so they are extremely accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What are the different types of quantitative data?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are three types of quantitative data, and each carries valuable information: discrete, continuous, and interval (as compared to ratio) data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Discrete data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Discrete data is information that can only take certain numerical values. This type of data is often represented using tally charts, bar graphs, or pie charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Discrete data is information that is collected and can be counted. This type of data only has a certain number of values. Typically, it involves integers—whole numbers, rather than fractions. For instance, the number of students in your class is discrete data to be counted as a whole (for example, you can’t have 22.5 students).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples of discrete data include: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of students in a class&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The how many cars driving above the speed limit on a freeway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Field goals landed in a football game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Continuous data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Continuous data is data that can take any value and can be infinitely broken down into smaller parts. It differs from discrete data in that it can change its value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Continuous data can also fluctuate over time. Some examples of continuous data are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brother is 114 inches tall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elephant weighs 3 tons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temperature of the sun is 10,000 Fahrenheit &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you can see, these can change at any given time. Additionally, continuous data can be classified as interval data or ratio data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Interval vs. ratio data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The difference between interval and ratio data derives from their ability to fall below zero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Interval scales can represent values below zero. Ratio variables, on the other hand, never fall below zero. Ratio data has all the characteristics of an interval scale, but it can also calculate ratios—meaning you can leverage numbers on a scale against zero. The ratio scale has an absolute zero or character of origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The difference between interval vs ratio data sets: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interval&lt;/b&gt;: A certain temperature can fall below 0 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ratio&lt;/b&gt;: Your height and weight cannot equal zero or be below zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How is quantitative data collected?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/#collection-methods-qd&quot;&gt;methods for collecting data&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/#quantitative-data-analysis-tools&quot;&gt;analytic tools&lt;/a&gt;, sampling, questionnaires, and open-source datasets, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Analytics tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://analytics.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; is a popular tool used by data analysts and data scientists to gather quantitative data from various sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Alongside Google Analytics, there are other tools that can be integrated with internal databases, data lakes, cloud storage, business apps, social media, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/IoT-device&quot;&gt;IoT devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Examples for analytics tools to start with: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cloud computing services by Google.

Each large sample can then be broken down by a data set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;There are two types of sampling:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Random probability sampling&lt;/b&gt;: where each unit within the overall dataset has the same chance of being selected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-probability sampling&lt;/b&gt;: where the sample is actively selected by the researcher or analyst—not at random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Quantitative data analysis could use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; (a common programming language) and various algorithms to extract samples from large data sets. The larger the data set, the more they can break down different sampling types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Questionnaires and surveys&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Questionnaires and surveys are another way to collect quantitative data—with feedback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/service/questionnaire&quot;&gt;questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; is a term used to describe the set of questions you&amp;#x27;re asking an individual. A questionnaire is actually a part of a survey. The purpose of a questionnaire is to gather data from a target audience. It will include open-ended questions, closed-ended questions, or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/research/survey-basics/&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data from participants and respondents. A survey goes much deeper than a questionnaire and often involves more than one form of data collection. The purpose of a survey is to find out information about a selected group of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, businesses use surveys to find out how specific customers behave. These survey questions can help transform business objectives, reduce friction and decrease churn.

In most datasets, the columns represent specific variables and the rows represent records within the dataset—with the intent of finding a correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The internet has a wide range of datasets, such as those from government, business, finance, science, manufacturing, entertainment, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are many sources for finding the data:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Google Dataset Search&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Dataset Search&lt;/a&gt; is Google’s standard search engine for data only. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data.gov&lt;/b&gt;: This is all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.data.gov/&quot;&gt;data from the US Government&lt;/a&gt; on various industries, which is publicly available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Datahub.io&lt;/b&gt;: Here you’ll find &lt;a href=&quot;https://datahub.io/&quot;&gt;economic or business datasets&lt;/a&gt; like entertainment, stock market data, inflation, financial logistics, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It is up to the user which dataset to use and there are many descriptive statistics to consider. Most of the online datasets are free to visit and find information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What are quantitative data examples?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since quantitative data is defined as the value of data in the form of counts or numbers, each data set has a numerical value associated with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Quantitative data examples in research &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you were using quantitative data in your analysis, you’ll be doing a lot of counting and measuring. Some basic examples of quantitative data include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight in pounds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Length in inches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distance in miles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number of days in a year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;/heatmap/&quot;&gt;heatmap&lt;/a&gt; of a web page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These research examples make up the core foundation of quantitative data and are widely used in statistical analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Quantitative data use cases in research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The value of analyzing quantitative data is considered a core part of any descriptive statistical analysis. Here are a few quantitative data use cases in research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Researchers project future data using algorithms and mathematical analysis tools. Weather patterns, supply and demand, and various scientific studies all rely on quantitative research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Research in healthcare is highly quantified in its data—with all things being measured and counted for the next cure or vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Government&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Governments carry out a census to acquire and record information about the members of a given population. They also rely on citywide data to predict the building of new infrastructure, roads, and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Business&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Businesses use quantitative data of the annual income of a person or household to determine their purchasing power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Online businesses use data to determine the number of website visits they get daily, the number of product downloads on the app store, the number of users, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And, businesses use customer satisfaction surveys data to tell you on a scale of 1-10 how they feel about a product or service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Quantitative data and you &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to data, we know how important it is, in fact, it’s all we do at FullStory. With a Digital Experience Intelligence platform, you can use quantitative data to become a better product, make happier customers and proactively enhance any experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Combine &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantitative and qualitative data&lt;/a&gt; for comprehensive understanding to perfect your digital experience. These different types of data can truly help the customer experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Looking at pure data analytics can be insightful, but requires that you know what you want to measure, what questions you want to answer, and the path you think users will take. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reviewing data session details provides invaluable context, but can be hard to see the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By combining the quantitative and qualitative in real time, FullStory eliminates data blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

User Conversion works on everything related to optimizing conversions—from content to design. They use &lt;a href=&quot;/session-replay/&quot;&gt;FullStory session replay&lt;/a&gt; to identify opportunities, aggregate insights, and run experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/session-replay-conversion-rate-optimization/&quot;&gt;FullStory session replay has become their go-to CRO tool&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that session recordings are one of the best conversion research techniques out there. —David Mannheim, User Conversion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In one example, the User Conversion team used session replay analysis to drive a &lt;b&gt;26% conversion rate uplift&lt;/b&gt; for an ecommerce client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is User Conversion&amp;#x27;s process for using session replay for CRO?&lt;/b&gt; And how do you manage the thousands of session recordings in FullStory and create structured outputs from subjective analysis of session replay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;David shared the answers to the above questions (and more) in a recent webinar—you can find the recording linked below. What follows is a deep dive into the User Conversion methodology wherein we explore in detail how you can &lt;b&gt;use session replay for conversion rate optimization&lt;/b&gt;. There is much to cover, so if you prefer to jump around, simply navigate using the in-page links below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to use session replay for conversion rate optimization&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For David and the User Conversion team, FullStory&amp;#x27;s search and session replay is &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; way to conduct user research, identifying opportunities, uncovering insights, and building experiments—all for the purpose of improving conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As David goes on to explain, the challenge in analyzing session recordings comes down to two things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Managing the volume of recordings. &lt;/b&gt;As David points out, a given client can have tens of thousands of session recordings. How do you know where to start?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bringing rigor to the subjectivity of analysis. &lt;/b&gt;Ask different people to watch a the same user session recording and you&amp;#x27;ll get completely different observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For the first problem—managing the volume of session recordings—David explains &lt;b&gt;you need to focus your analysis around an objective&lt;/b&gt;. Identify an aspect of your site you suspect could be optimized. As an example, if your objective is to improve the conversion rate around the checkout process, you could use FullStory search to segment user sessions by those who engage with the checkout flow but do not convert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If the resulting set of sessions still seems too big to manage, refine your search further by filtering your sessions using additional criteria—e.g. device, acquisition source, click behaviors, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have a workable set of sessions to observe—and you still won&amp;#x27;t need to watch them all—you can begin your qualitative research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You might be wondering &lt;b&gt;how do you apply rigor to qualitatively analyzing session recordings?&lt;/b&gt; For this, David has developed a methodology that brings a quantitative feel to the qualitative nature of session replay analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;David&amp;#x27;s structured analysis uses a Google Sheet—you can find &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EZQAylsMe9-NRO5XOsg6Cu2t6lIupyI9jDlnw1q01d4/edit&quot;&gt;the template here&lt;/a&gt;. What the template does is force you to record observations from sessions into a file that becomes the foundation for identifying opportunities and insights. This methodical process is important because of the outputs it creates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What you see in the above screenshot is the result of User Conversion mining session recordings over the course of a few hours. You can see how the URL column includes a link to the FullStory session and each following column allows for notes and categorization of observations, including device, template (or page in question), action, and priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keeping your qualitative research simple—making a specific observation and recording it in a spreadsheet—allows you to move through many sessions and make tons of observations. While running through this observational process, reserve judgment for what needs to be done and, as David suggests, try not to go down the rabbit hole. Stay focused on the objective of your analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As your observations pile up, they feed into a &amp;quot;Summary Document.&amp;quot; You can see what that looks like below (it&amp;#x27;s also in the template):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Note the highlighted lines. These are instances where the same observation was made across different session recordings (as in the first screenshot above). User Conversion&amp;#x27;s template aggregates subjective, qualitative observations from different user session recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From this aggregation of subjective observations, patterns begin to emerge. Common problems surface across sessions. And the insights that result allow User Conversion to prioritize next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Do the work and record and categorize your observations. Once your reach a point of diminishing returns and watching more sessions yields few novel observations, stop and either refine the set further (based on new observations), or determine next steps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Case study: Travis Perkins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From session replay analytics to A/B testing experiments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having identified opportunities and insights, User Conversion creates hypotheses centered on whatever problems customers appear to be having. These hypotheses drive User Conversion to conduct experiments using Monetate, an A/B testing tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;People tend to think that when you experiment, you experiment from an idea, and that&amp;#x27;s not really the case. You actually experiment from a user problem. — David Mannheim&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One of User Conversion&amp;#x27;s clients is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travisperkins.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Travis Perkins&lt;/a&gt;—a building products retailer in the UK. While analyzing Travis Perkins&amp;#x27; session recordings, User Conversion observed that website visitors on certain pages appeared to be aimlessly searching through different product categories. David comments about a given users behavior while watching a session recording:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is this user trying to do? As David says, &amp;quot;When you&amp;#x27;re analyzing session recordings, it&amp;#x27;s often the things that you don&amp;#x27;t see that are the most important. Try to think about why they&amp;#x27;re doing what they&amp;#x27;re doing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Building off this observation, User Conversion refined their focus further, hunting for other sessions that contained similar customer behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having observed many different user sessions and observing the same kind of customer behaviors crop up time and time again, the User Conversion team came up with a hypothesis. Perhaps customers were having trouble with the way information was organized on the Travis Perkins site and showing signs of struggle because the navigation and search functionalities weren&amp;#x27;t helping them find what they were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Based on this hypothesis, User Conversion came up with an experiment. What if they provided an index, alphabetically organized navigation menu in addition to their product categories. Perhaps that would help users get to where they wanted to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having come up with an experiment they could test, User Conversion used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.monetate.com/&quot;&gt;Monetate&lt;/a&gt; to conduct A/B tests. Again, using FullStory they made new observations about just those consumers who interact with the A-Z product listing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The results of this experiment were incredible.&lt;/b&gt; Of those users who interacted with the menu, User Conversion saw a 26% lift in conversion. They continue to refine the menu through watching session recordings of users who interact with it so that they can optimize the UI further. That&amp;#x27;s a huge &lt;a href=&quot;/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantifiable impact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You don&amp;#x27;t have to be working on ecommerce stores or product pages to use this method of conversion optimization, and it readily applies to any given landing page, homepage, or product pages. Session replay provides the nuanced information you need to understand opportunities for higher conversions. Furthermore, combining your analysis with multivariate tests—and using session replay to observe the user experience will produce test results you can act on to drive your CRO efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a powerful methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tips for successful session replay analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Successful session playback analysis requires attention to detail.&lt;/b&gt; That&amp;#x27;s why David and team only watch user session recordings at 1X speed. David cautions that while increasing the playback speed can make watching your user recordings go faster, it can mean missing customer behavior nuances—like hesitating before clicking on a button. It&amp;#x27;s often the nuances that reveal what is—or isn&amp;#x27;t—happening with that customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Watch the mouse movements—hypothesize what they might mean.&lt;/b&gt; David relates how at times you can derive offsite behavior by simply watching mouse movements. For example, if you see the mouse move up and to the left, it may signal that the user is opening a new tab, as might be the case when a customer is going to look for reviews or price checking. Again, the details captured in session recordings make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another example is how they&amp;#x27;ve observed that customers often appear to highlight product names and then mouse up to the top of the browser navigation. What&amp;#x27;s happening? They&amp;#x27;re highlighting a product name to copy it for the purpose of running a price-check or hunt down some reviews on Google or Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Knowing how customers behave can result in creative solutions or experiments to try and improve the customer experience—and optimize for conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be ready to set aside a few hours or even a couple days to run an analysis.&lt;/b&gt; The success of session replay analysis hinges on doing the hard work of making observations across enough sessions that actionable insights emerge. The good news is that from this effort will come a large set of opportunities, whether they&amp;#x27;re immediate fixes or insights that lead to experiments you can run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session replay for CRO requires a systematic approach.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;User Conversion&amp;#x27;s overall process for user research revolves around their &amp;quot;COIE Optimisation Framework,&amp;quot; where &amp;quot;COIE&amp;quot; is an acronym for Configuration, Opportunities, Insights, and Experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can read more about how User Conversion conducts user research on their site, but the critical tool they use—as noted in David&amp;#x27;s presentation by the &amp;quot;FS&amp;quot; between the overlapping circles you see above—is FullStory session replay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;User Conversion&amp;#x27;s approach works because it brings a systematic approach to session replay analysis&lt;/b&gt; (See our discussion of how &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;Quantitative Data and Qualitative Research Work Better Together&lt;/a&gt;), introducing rigor to an otherwise subjective process in order to identify opportunities and tease out insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;All it requires to get started with this process is to determine what your objective is. From there, use FullStory to search your session recordings. The search results will leave you with a focused list of user sessions that will be filled with opportunities and insights that can be used to drive higher conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Want to know more?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re intrigued by User Conversion&amp;#x27;s process for conversion optimization and interested in putting it to work, watching the full webinar below is highly recommended (Pro-tip: you can boost the replay speed by tapping the gear icon). 90+% of live attendees stayed for the entire hour-long webinar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Or, learn more about other ways to improve your CRO, like &lt;a href=&quot;/heatmap/&quot;&gt;heatmaps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;WEBINAR RECORDING » How to use session replay for conversion rate optimisation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you prefer, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/qxlDtfPNi00&quot;&gt;find the webinar recording on YouTube here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[8 website heatmap examples to better your bottom line]]></title><description><![CDATA[Heatmaps can provide rich information about your website.

Think of a heatmap as a way of understanding how popular certain elements of your website or mobile app are. It shows where people are scrolling, clicking and where they stick around a warm-to-cold color scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;In general, heatmaps allow you to:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track user behavior &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluate user interests on your website&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand what’s ignored on your website&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)&quot;&gt;call-to-actions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find out what causes friction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catch page abandonment in action&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimize conversion rate and design&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The key benefit of heatmaps is that they simplify complex numerical data sets into easily understood visuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, heatmaps are powerful tools with many use cases, and applications across many industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A few heatmap examples:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Streaming services use heatmaps to optimize their viewing experience by identifying target audiences’ interests, understanding which recommendations users look at and which they ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market uses heatmaps to identify trends in the market at a glance. It uses a cold to hot color scheme to analyze stock options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports teams use heatmaps to plot players’ performance, identify patterns for improvement, and study rival strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Website heatmaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Website heatmaps provide insights into user behavior, making them a valuable tool for businesses. Specifically, a heatmap uses color-coding to visually represent how users browse your website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A website heatmap is a true representation of all visitor actions—whether that be engagement, frustration, or friction—heatmaps showcase it all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Types of website heatmaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Clickmap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A clickmap is a map of how people use a website or a specific landing page. Clickmaps show you an overall aggregate of where visitors click their mouse and can be referred to as “touch maps”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Clickmaps can help identify navigational gaps on a webpage or mobile device. Are your users completely missing where to go next? Find out with a clickmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Clickmaps also show which parts of a webpage are clicked on the most (and the least) and help identify navigational and conversion problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One use case may be gathering data on CTAs. Or if users are clicking on areas that are not clickable—like an image or text that people expect to be linked. That gives you insight into what to change on that particular page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pros of clickmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improve ROI by placing effective CTA buttons and monitoring them with clickmaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clickmaps allow you to identify and remove areas that cause friction and distract users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clickmaps visually represent which categories and areas are most popular and where the gaps are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When running a clickmap on your website, it allows you to monitor conversion rates for new and returning visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cons of clickmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improper readings may occur from accidental (multiple) login use, where a user repeatedly clicks on the same element. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frustrated clicks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;rage clicks&lt;/a&gt; can skew data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be other issues caused by interactive elements, responsive design rules, browser/device incompatibilities, or differences in page content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pro tip: &lt;/b&gt;Track at least 2,000 page views per screen for accurate clickmap readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Scrollmap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/scroll-maps/&quot;&gt;scrollmap&lt;/a&gt; is a type of heatmap that’s a visual representation of visitors&amp;#x27; scrolling behavior on your website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On a scrollmap, the top of the page is red, meaning that it’s the most viewed area on the page, and the color turns yellow to green to blue towards the bottom of the page, showing fewer and fewer visitors scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Specifically, scrollmaps tell you: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the number of visitors who scrolled through a page to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the number of visitors who scrolled through a page but did not scroll to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the number of visitors who abandoned a page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use scrollmaps to help calculate the ideal length of a webpage beyond which visitors don&amp;#x27;t scroll down, identify whether or not visitors reach the content below the fold, and spot &lt;a href=&quot;https://cxl.com/blog/false-bottom/&quot;&gt;false floor or false bottom&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, scrollmaps help identify important content being ignored—like the most actionable items you can use to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pros of scrollmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scrollmap is beneficial when designing longer web pages by helping you understand where to prioritize important elements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use scrollmaps to develop strategies to entice users to scroll further down to the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scrollmaps are an excellent tool for optimizing “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/above-the-fold/&quot;&gt;above the fold&lt;/a&gt;”. Above the fold is the part of your website that visitors can see without needing to scroll down and is typically the most visited part of the page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cons of scrollmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scrollmaps don’t always provide accurate data visualization. Scrolling activity is not necessarily an indication of how they are engaging with the content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scrollmaps don’t measure clicks, which doesn’t allow you to measure the effectiveness of an element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scrollmap may not be beneficial for websites with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kirupa.com/html5/dynamic_elements.htm&quot;&gt;dynamic elements&lt;/a&gt;. With web design becoming more dynamic, it can complicate scrollmap data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further viewing:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KrYFO_z-eQ&quot;&gt;Learn more about how FullStory&amp;#x27;s utilizes scrollmaps in our platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Error click heatmap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624154-Rage-Clicks-Error-Clicks-Dead-Clicks-and-Thrashed-Cursor-Frustration-Signals#error-clicks&quot;&gt;Error clicks&lt;/a&gt; are when a user click triggers a client-side &lt;a href=&quot;https://geekflare.com/javascript-common-errors/&quot;&gt;JavaScript error&lt;/a&gt; or website error occurs. Error clicks may or may not result in a user noticing something is broken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; solution like FullStory, you can create an Error Click heatmap to pick up any unforeseen errors on your website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can use this heatmap to specifically investigate console errors or uncaught exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you find something that seems wrong, you can run another search scoped to the specific click event that triggered the error and view all sessions with Error Clicks around that event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pros of error clicked heatmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With error clicks, you can reproduce bugs on the fly to proactively fix them before a user engages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Error click heatmaps can drastically improve the online experience on your site or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Error clicks can be helpful in surfacing a functional sample of data sessions to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cons of error clicked heatmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Error clicks can be the result of many different factors (web design, hosting issues, etc) and it may take time to find the source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Error clicks don’t provide the context for the error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Error clicks are likely to be noticed by users, creating frustrating online experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Rage click heatmap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624154-Rage-Clicks-Error-Clicks-Dead-Clicks-and-Thrashed-Cursor-Frustration-Signals#rage-clicks&quot;&gt;Rage clicks&lt;/a&gt; occur when users rapid-fire click (or tap) on your site or app in frustration. Whether the button or area doesn’t function or is producing an error, the rage clicking showcases friction with the product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A rage click heatmap will show you all the areas that a user has frustratedly clicked errors, with signature heat indexes. It&amp;#x27;s not easy to predict what might cause a user’s rage, which is why searching your user sessions in a best-in-class DXI solution for Rage Click events is so helpful—you&amp;#x27;ll discover unexpected opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pros of rage click heatmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rage click heatmaps can help you reproduce unexpected bugs and errors to proactively fix them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rage click heatmaps can correct any confusion on CTAs for better conversions &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rage clicks are a strong signal and therefore lead to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;actionable insights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these heatmaps can increase your ROI due to clearing up product friction across the board. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cons of rage click heatmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rage click heatmaps may (at first) surface false positives. For instance, users may be paging through a multi-page app and click repeatedly on the same element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of web elements that can induce rage clicks, from graphics to text, so pairing them down can be tricky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Dead click heatmap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624154-Rage-Clicks-Error-Clicks-Dead-Clicks-and-Thrashed-Cursor-Frustration-Signals#dead-clicks&quot;&gt;Dead clicks&lt;/a&gt; are when users click an element on your website or app but the click has no effect. Dead click heatmaps will find any non-functioning element with heat signatures and data intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pros of dead click heatmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand behavioral trends with dead click heatmaps over time and create new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop non-functioning CTAs before they hit mass-market product updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cons of dead click heatmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead clicks’ behavioral signals can be nuanced and subtle, which makes them hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a chance for false positives with dead click heatmaps—based on the different website functions and user behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. Mouse tracking heatmap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vwo.com/blog/mouse-heatmap/&quot;&gt;Mouse tracking heatmaps&lt;/a&gt; help identify areas on which visitors are spending the most (and the least) time on your website. It has many names: mouse movement heat map, move map, attention heatmaps, or hover maps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mouse heatmaps visually represent user mouse movement data using thermal imaging – it records where visitors are navigating, clicking, scrolling, and stopping on your website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Research shows a correlation between where users are looking and where their mouse cursor is, so these can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pros of mouse tracking heatmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse heatmaps allow you to identify hover patterns that can help discover areas of high visitor frustration and friction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse tracking also helps to optimize complex web pages made up of content, images, and dynamic elements in any matrix. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse tracking has the ability to estimate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algolia.com/blog/product/what-is-search-relevance/&quot;&gt;relevance of search results&lt;/a&gt; by the volume of clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cons of mouse tracking heatmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users tend to be “over-clickers” and click on literally everything, which can impact mouse-tracking data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With mouse heatmaps, you have to rely on the visitors’ own objectives, not a controlled testing environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you can’t ask your users direct questions about their experiences with mouse tracking—so you ultimately don’t know what their intentions are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;7. Eye-tracking heatmap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vwo.com/blog/eye-tracking-heatmap/#:~:text=Eye%20tracking%20heatmap%20gathers%20and,of%20an%20eye%20tracking%20heatmap.&quot;&gt;Eye-tracking heatmaps&lt;/a&gt; provide information about where visitors are looking on a given page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They can also be used to track the visitor&amp;#x27;s gaze pattern to place all-important content and images in the most attention-grabbing sections of a page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Eye-tracking heatmaps can be used to ascertain how engaging certain images on a website are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pros of eye-tracking heatmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eye-tracking heatmaps provide incredibly accurate data. It will show you exactly what users are looking at on your web page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These types of heatmaps go hand in hand with mouse tracking maps, which can validate user data results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eye-tracking is based on natural human reactions, so you can see user flow easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cons of eye-tracking heatmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eye-tracking data results are typically based on a small sampling of unique visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eye-tracking heatmap tools are costly and that cost can increase the more users you’re trying to track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some advanced users know they are being tracked and have the ability to cover up their cameras. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;8. AI-generated heatmaps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Artificially intelligent (AI) generated attention heatmaps are visual representations of user attention data created by a software algorithm. Heatmaps generated by AI show which areas of the website users are likely to view the most (and the least). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Typically, AI heatmaps focus on imitating the first 3-5 seconds of user attention on a website—in order to predict future behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pros of AI-generated heatmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-generated heatmaps can predict where people &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; look when engaged with a website—which can be beneficial for future improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since eye-tracking heatmaps are costly, an AI-based alternative is less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-generated heatmaps have up to 95% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These heatmaps can validate your concepts prelaunch and also analyze your potential client’s websites to gather valuable insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cons of AI-generated heatmaps: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI-generated heatmaps don’t work well with low-volume websites, as there are fewer actions to predict. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These heatmaps often come with restrictions on actionable usage and are often pay-to-play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Heatmaps and DXI &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Heatmaps are incredibly resourceful for any website looking for insights on users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a DXI solution like FullStory, you can access your colorful new heatmaps—or &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059659773-Why-are-Click-Maps-and-Inspect-Mode-showing-different-click-counts-&quot;&gt;Click Maps&lt;/a&gt;—with &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624074-Page-Insights-User-Guide&quot;&gt;Page Insights&lt;/a&gt; from within any &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt;.

You all know me: I’m the one who never complains, no matter what kind of service I get. I never criticize. No, I’m the nice customer. And I’ll tell you who else I am. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;I’m the customer who never comes back!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;” ~ Author Unknown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The short of it is that only a small number of customers complain or provide honest, constructive criticism of their experiences–in fact &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/50-important-customer-exp_b_8295772?ec_carp=6823990201176436044&quot;&gt;CX researcher Esteban Kolsky found that 91% of unhappy customers who are non-complainers simply leave&lt;/a&gt;–be they at a 5-star hotel or at your digital front door. In fact, business leaders often mistake a quiet customer for a happy one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yet, as I learned in conversations with Faith Adams at Forrester, the bulk of brands don’t go beyond VoC, and digital teams today spend an inordinate amount of time culling through reviews and surveys in hopes of finding the reasons customer bounce or churn. That feedback is valuable–but imagine all the customers who simply arrived on your site or in your app, couldn’t find what they wanted or began a transaction only to hit a frustrating snag or bug, and simply left. They were busy and if your brand couldn’t be bothered to create a helpful, friction-free experience, why should they bother leaving feedback? After all, there’s a perfectly good competitor just a few clicks away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if you had Magic Goggles? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a young manager in a hotel, I learned to watch my guests’ body language, non-verbal cues, and patterns. It became easy to spot someone who wasn’t having a great experience–I might ask them for input or simply observe a long wait, the hold times, a cold dish. Unfortunately, that level of observation is nearly impossible at scale–at least in real life. When it comes to digital, however, &lt;i&gt;it is possible &lt;/i&gt;to learn at scale about the hang time, the error clicks, and a large array of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/heatmap-examples/&quot;&gt;observable frustration signals your customers&lt;/a&gt; are experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we affectionately refer to our software as a pair of ‘Magic Goggles.’ By collecting and analyzing data for high-fidelity recreation of user sessions, minus sensitive data, we provide deep visibility into a customer’s digital experience, enabling brands to understand and empathize with users and site visitors at scale. Tools like Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Heap, and Mixpanel all tell you &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;what&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;happened on your site. VoC gives you a glimpse of a few reasons that your most engaged customers were annoyed. But none of them offer the unspoken answers to &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;why&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; customers won’t come back quite like digital experience intelligence solutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The magic of these theoretical goggles is the unfiltered observation of the good, the bad, the ugly, and typically unintentional flaws that cause your customers digital distress. We recently engaged with a restaurant that learned that their digital, in-store ordering app had a bug in a specific operating system that was preventing customers from tipping their waitstaff. The realization that they were not only frustrating customers but also shortchanging their staff led to cringes all around–and a high priority fix. This was something they hadn’t learned with any of the other tools in their toolkit–the Magic Goggles truly opened their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The modern PM’s DX stack: FullStory + VoC + Web Analytics + Testing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’ll admit, as much as I enjoyed certain aspects of my hospitality career, I don’t relish the days of ‘anecdata,’ essentially sifting through handwritten comment cards and attempting to personally observe guest frustrations. Living in the age of digital experiences and real-time access to insights about their flows, dropoff points, RageClicks (™), and more is rather magical. Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://aithority.com/machine-learning/using-ai-to-drive-human-empathy-at-machine-scale/&quot;&gt;AI and machine learning to develop empathy&lt;/a&gt; for customers has never been easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For digital experience leaders and product managers, there is a dizzying array of tools available to help pull together this story. We believe there is a set of critical components emerging as the ideal tech stack for this modern DX leader or PM. It sits at the intersection of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantitative and qualitative data&lt;/a&gt; connected to experimentation for ultimate understanding and optimized outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Best in class brands are investing in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;VoC:&lt;/b&gt; The OG of customer-led tools, VoC is still a critical component for knowing your customer. Hearing directly from a handful of customers lends context and emotion to other insights.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Web Analytics:&lt;/b&gt; Without them, brands would struggle to understand core traffic patterns and relationships with referring domains, organic keywords, and their related end results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A/B Testing:&lt;/b&gt; Now mainstream and included as a capability in many digital experience platforms, the ability to test hypotheses and drive toward statistically improved outcomes has become table stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DX Intelligence: &lt;/b&gt;With 15-20 percent market penetration and rapid growth according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/document/code/450428?ref=ddisp&amp;amp;refval=450428&quot;&gt;Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Customer Experience Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, qualitative data generated through observation at scale is emerging as a powerful complement to more traditional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/#quantitative-data-analysis-tools&quot;&gt;quantitative tools&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Double down on digital insights to delight and retain customers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Recently, the team at FTD embarked on a digital transformation that relies on FullStory as a lynchpin among its suite of best-in-class solutions to help PMs and engineers think more about users than system flow. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.informationweek.com/strategic-cio/digital-business/ftds-cto-powell-on-transforming-and-the-next-new-normal/a/d-id/1340585&quot;&gt;company is rearchitecting&lt;/a&gt; to create “surprise and delight” experiences, and needs robust data to understand where, how, and why users are getting frustrated or hitting snags along the way. With an immense amount of change in their digital touchpoints, simply waiting on customers to tell them where they encounter issues isn’t good enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This year promises to be pivotal for digital customer experiences. Now is the time for brands to get ahold of some Magic Goggles that allow them to anticipate customer needs and observe their overall digital experience by going beyond a handful of survey responses. Use the power of the modern DX stack and take advantage of the new capabilities that digital experience intelligence affords to empathize with &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; your customers–and keep them coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;To read more about building a tech stack that helps you get the most out of your data, check out our &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/rs/002-LDF-436/images/MSS-Support-Stack.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;guide to the Modern Support Stack&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session Replay Q&A: How DXI makes the most of qualitative data]]></title><description><![CDATA[Find out how leading DXI platforms utilize Session Replay to present actionable qualitative data to product, UX, and engineering teams.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dxi-session-replay</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dxi-session-replay</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence, as we discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-intelligence-features-for-complete-dx-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;previous posts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is the powerful combination of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/qualitative-vs-quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;quantitative and qualitative data&lt;/a&gt; that unlocks a comprehensive understanding of digital experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But—how does that work, exactly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Quantitative data is intuitive enough: it’s the percentages and visualizations that can steer teams’ decisions at a glance. But how is qualitative data gathered, and how do the two combine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The answer, for Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) tools such as FullStory, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By recreating—not recording—user sessions, product, engineering, and UX teams get total visibility into &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; your users interact with your website or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/dxi-for-mobile-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;native mobile app&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Below, find a quick Q&amp;amp;A on some of the most common questions about Session Replay. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The five most common questions about Session Replay&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do I need to manually tag elements to use DXI?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;No—forget manual tagging.&lt;/b&gt; Best-in-class DXI platforms such as FullStory should automatically capture and filter &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; interaction from &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; user on your site. This builds a faultless foundation for all qualitative data gathered from users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt; Imagine you’re an ecommerce product manager, and you’re rolling out a new checkout option onto your site. You want to see how your customers are interacting with it, but because it’s new, your team hasn’t manually tagged it yet. FullStory’s Session Replay relies on instrumentation-free data, so there are no blindspots, even for new or updated elements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can Session Replay be implemented out of the box?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yes. &lt;/b&gt;When you choose a DXI platform such as FullStory that&amp;#x27;s straightforward to implement and works with complex JavaScript frameworks, custom components, or frameworks that rely on shadow DOM, Session Replay works in just a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt; Imagine you’re a front-end website developer. You’ve had trouble finding web analytics tools that are compatible with the tailor-made way your site or mobile app was built, so you have limited visibility into performance. DXI platforms that offer simple implementations and compatibility across frameworks can help—even for the most complex sites and apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Are Session Replay recordings detailed enough to create useful insight?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Absolutely. &lt;/b&gt;Best-in-class DXI platforms allow you to fast-forward through irrelevant interactions, skip inactivity, scroll to pivotal moments, and log custom events to add context to sessions, allowing you to create useful insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt; Imagine you’re prioritizing your company’s engineering backlog, and you want to identify the most urgent work that also has the most potential for impact. You want to escalate the top growth opportunities, but don’t want to watch user sessions for hours to determine the right course of action. Instead, rely on a DXI platform that offers tools to quickly and effectively surface insights for you, saving you time and helping you prioritize with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can Session Replay help teams work more closely together? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Yes.&lt;/b&gt; Session Replay captures what a customer sees &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; what is going on behind the scenes of their user experience—what browser they’re using, their operating system, and previous sessions, among other data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This helps teams better understand and support them, and helps teams internally communicate user errors across teams—from product to UX to engineering.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt; Imagine you’re an engineer tasked with fixing a widespread bug on your company’s website. You’re overwhelmed by the amount of data you’ll need to filter through to understand when the glitch occurs. With a DXI platform that surfaces the &lt;i&gt;essential&lt;/i&gt; information about user sessions, you’re able to identify where and when users are experiencing the bug, whether it’s occurring in a specific browser or operating system, and collaborate with product and customer success teams in communicating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does Session Replay risk user privacy?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Absolutely not.&lt;/b&gt; By default, leading DXI tools such as FullStory do not log sensitive user data. This equips you with tools to manage privacy, consent, and selective exclusion of on-screen text to protect both your customers &lt;i&gt;and you&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt; Imagine you’re a mobile product manager at a fintech company who wants to see how customers navigate through your redesigned mobile experience to apply for a new account. Of course, you want to do this without capturing (or seeing) any of the personally identifiable information customers have to provide to open an account. Put your trust in a DXI platform that empowers your organization to manage privacy seamlessly—without the need for external support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a DXI platform that creates superior session replays, you’ll get 20/20 vision into how &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; your customers interact with your site or app the way they do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

Unfortunately, very few shoppers actually complain when they are dissatisfied; most simply churn without saying anything[1].&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/#fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This lack of feedback leaves brands in the dark—pondering high bounce rates and low conversion rates in confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So how do you identify and fix pain points quickly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One of the best ways to find (and fix) frustration on your site—or mobile app—is through searching in FullStory for session recordings containing &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/#rage-clicks&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. Rage Clicks are moments when users repeatedly click, click, &lt;i&gt;click&lt;/i&gt;—and tap—on a website, mobile app, or any other digital experience because they&amp;#x27;re frustrated. For many product managers, this metric is a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt; can&amp;#x27;t pick up on mouse slamming, keyboard pounding, exasperated muttering, or other physical abuse of computer hardware, clicking multiple times on a specific element on your site is the nearest digital equivalent. Rapid-fire clicks on your site can be a clear signal of a frustrated computer user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks are the virtual equivalent of mashing an unresponsive button on a vending machine—only it&amp;#x27;s a mouse button.

Rage Clicks are a simple, universal indicator that the customer experience could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks reveal actionable insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You just saw that you had an increase in your bounce rate.

Session replay allows you to replay the experiences of users on your site so that you can tease apart what&amp;#x27;s really going on. Of course, you have thousands of sessions, so which ones should you watch? You can search for Rage Click events in FullStory to narrow down those sessions that are most likely going wrong, allowing you to focus your efforts and save time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, if you see your bounce rate is alarmingly high on a specific landing page, you can search for and watch sessions in FullStory for users that visited that specific landing page. You can further narrow down the resulting list of sessions to those that contain Rage Clicks. These sessions will have a high probability of containing user information you can immediately put to work to understand what&amp;#x27;s damaging the digital customer experience—so that you can fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you watch sessions that contain Rage Clicks, there&amp;#x27;s a high probability of uncovering an insight on which you can take action—a.k.a. the elusive &amp;quot;actionable insights&amp;quot;—because Rage Clicks happen alongside the frustrating experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since you&amp;#x27;re able to see that frustrating experience through FullStory session replay, you get the nuanced, detailed information you need to both understand what&amp;#x27;s going wrong and figure out what you can do to fix it, reduce UI confusion, and increase conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Case study » Improve activation rate through Rage Clicks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ty Magnin of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.appcues.com/&quot;&gt;Appcues&lt;/a&gt; relates how Rage Clicks helped surface bounce rate issues—issues that never would have been clear otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The signup form on Appcues—after collecting your email address—used to display a small bit of text on the submit button after you clicked it. The button would display, “Warming up our engines...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As the Appcues team discovered, this subtle bit of copy was actually confusing users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On clicking the &amp;quot;Create your first experience&amp;quot; button users had to wait a meaningful amount of time; they struggled to intuit that “warming up&amp;quot; implied &amp;quot;things are happening—please be patient.” As a result, Appcues saw that users were Rage Clicking the submit button over and over—all while the site&amp;#x27;s backend was trying to process a fair amount of &lt;a href=&quot;/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; to set up their account in the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What was intended to be a helpful, human bit of copy ended up having the opposite effect. Users, confused by the text on the button, were expressing their frustration by clicking the button repeatedly—and leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To fix this, the team quickly coded up a new bit of copy to display after the button was clicked.

While a wide variety of things can lead to user rage, below are some common points that spur Rage Clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dead time: &lt;/b&gt;Like the Appcues example, whenever a user is not in control of your site and it&amp;#x27;s unclear what&amp;#x27;s happening, you may see a flurry of Rage Clicks. The quintessential example is waiting on a video to load. Impatience mounts quickly and before you know it click click click.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re waiting for external input or loading data, make that clear to your users before they conclude your site is simply broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Misleading buttons: &lt;/b&gt;Rage Clicks on site elements often indicate that a user expects that element to &lt;i&gt;do something&lt;/i&gt;. Perhaps a CSS selector is misbehaving and making an element look like something that should be clicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sometimes it can help you discover a more efficient route through your web site or app (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-are-desire-paths-and-how-use-desire-paths-for-design-and-development/&quot;&gt;a digital desire path&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dead links: &lt;/b&gt;If you have text that looks like a link but isn&amp;#x27;t, prepare for lots of clicking as users click click click expecting something to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anywhere you have interactivity: &lt;/b&gt;Whether it&amp;#x27;s finely scrubbing a video or audio or expanding and contracting a sidebar, Rage Clicks on interactive site elements can clue you into places where you could make your product easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Repeatedly tapping through a widget on your app (i.e. a calendar) could trigger a Rage Click event that may not seem overtly &amp;quot;frustrating”; however, ask yourself if there might be an opportunity to reduce clicks and improve the UX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;False positives: &lt;/b&gt;Sometimes Rage Click events in FullStory &lt;i&gt;don&amp;#x27;t &lt;/i&gt;correlate to UI confusion. User frustration manifested as rapid-fire click click clicking can be caused by external factors: When user rage is driven by an uncooperative device, for example.

Or, ever wanted to buy a brand new shiny thing before it sells out only to get stuck looking at a spinning wheel icon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you can relate to experiences like this, then you can imagine how your customers feel when they&amp;#x27;re waiting on your website to render. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the end of the day, we all hate to wait—precisely why performance is one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/7-causes-of-bad-user-experiences/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;major causes of bad user experiences&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The importance of website performance &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Web performance matters whether you&amp;#x27;ve got an ecommerce shop, a marketing site, or an online app. When we talk about &amp;quot;performance,&amp;quot; we&amp;#x27;re referring to the speed and reliability of a website. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the website or mobile app up? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it functional? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it fast enough?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Websites of all kinds are more complex than ever, which means they&amp;#x27;re also larger and slower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We love all of the third-party bells and whistles—everything from engaging comment sections, to product rating widgets, to scripts like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/DXI-fullstory-google-analytics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solutions like FullStory that help us understand how people use websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But every plugin or script on a website can add to loading time, and it increases the amount of data required for a customer to view a page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Luckily, where there&amp;#x27;s a performance problem, there&amp;#x27;s an opportunity. Faster websites have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lower bounce rates&lt;/b&gt;—On average Shopify stores experience a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.littledata.io/average/bounce-rate-from-desktop-Google-search/Shopify&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;38.7% bounce rate on desktop&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.littledata.io/average/bounce-rate-from-mobile-Google-search/Shopify&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;48.5% on mobile devices&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; due to slow loading pages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Higher conversion rates&lt;/b&gt;—Ancestry.com saw their sign-ups increase by 7% when they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/8rffw1px0yn05gm/Velocity-NY-Jed-Wood-Ancestry-User-Centered-Metrics.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;made their start render time 68% faster&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better SEO&lt;/b&gt;—Pinterest rebuilt their website for performance and saw a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/driving-user-growth-with-performance-improvements-cfc50dafadd7&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;15% increase in SEO traffic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better customer experience&lt;/b&gt;—Kissmetrics reports that a 1-second delay will &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/?wide=1&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;decrease customer satisfaction by about 16%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Optimizing for performance is an opportunity to maximize customer experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Two ways to improve web performance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Two of the biggest drags on performance are unoptimized images and performance-degrading scripts. We&amp;#x27;ll look at how to turn these into opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Optimize your images&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Image optimization is one of the fundamental practices that can help improve your site performance, and it doesn&amp;#x27;t have to be complicated. If you have access to your CMS you can start optimizing images today. Here&amp;#x27;s how:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Remove excess metadata &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Did you know that most image files contain more than what&amp;#x27;s needed to render a picture?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When we save images in various formats, programs usually also save useless metadata about the photo in that file. This metadata might include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the photo location&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;what type of camera or device took the photo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;history of versions, comments, layers, or color profiles from the app where a photo was edited&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You don&amp;#x27;t need all of that extra metadata. For SEO purposes, you just need the description of the photo along with a name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Download an image optimization app, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://imageoptim.com/mac&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ImageOptim&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Drag and drop your images into ImageOptim to scrub the images clean of the invisible junk you don&amp;#x27;t need. Then, upload them again to your site.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check image sizes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Often when we upload images, we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.logrocket.com/a-guide-to-css-at-rules/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;CSS rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or a resizing functionality to make those images smaller than the original size so they fit into our page layouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the images may look relatively small on your mobile device or browser, the files for those images could be much larger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Check to see whether any of your resized images are still referencing larger image files. Then, resize those images to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flothemes.com/flothemes-image-sizes/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;minimum height and width&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the largest they&amp;#x27;d ever render in the context of your site&amp;#x27;s design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Convert .GIFs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Animated &lt;a href=&quot;https://giphy.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;GIFs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are fun—it helps inject personality into a blog post. A GIF animation can make an image on a product page sing. And, if you&amp;#x27;re writing educational content, an animated .gif can be truly helpful for demonstrating multi-step processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, the GIF format was not originally designed with animation in mind, and it&amp;#x27;s not a performant way to render animation online. Animated GIFs are often larger than video files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Audit your usage of third-party scripts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Do you have access to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://tagmanager.google.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Tag Manager&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or where third-party scripts are added to your website? If so, here&amp;#x27;s how to get some quick performance gains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Remove old scripts &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Take a few minutes to make sure that you&amp;#x27;re not currently loading any &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/loading-third-party-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;third-party scripts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for services that you no longer use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t use A/B tests for “hotfixes”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
We love A/B testing tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/thomas-pivots-mid-crisis-with-fullstory-optimizely/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Optimizely&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that give us the power to run comparison tests on a whim, but with great power comes great responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some A/B testing tool scripts can slow down the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seobility.net/en/wiki/Rendering&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;page render&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as you’re swapping in the variants to use for experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because there&amp;#x27;s a performance trade-off there, be sure that you&amp;#x27;re only using &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411046364823-A-B-Testing-Approaches-in-FullStory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;A/B testing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for experiments and not to make &amp;quot;hotfixes&amp;quot; to content on your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additional tips for enhancing performance &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It doesn’t end there. If you Google &amp;quot;web performance best practices,&amp;quot; you&amp;#x27;ll find an enormous wealth of valuable resources on best practices to make your website faster, including tips on how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.belugacdn.com/blog/cdn/what-is-cdn/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Use a CDN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/LeverageBrowserCaching&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Leverage browser cacheing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/service/CombineCSS&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Combine CSS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/service/MinifyCSS&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Minify CSS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/service/CombineJavaScript&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Combine Javascript&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/service/OptimizeJavaScript&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Optimize Javascript&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re serious about improving performance, start reading up on best practices and make plans to optimize and measure improvements for your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Deploy tools to spark a culture of performance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Good habits are easier to develop when your organization has a culture of performance, where everyone sees the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/cx-and-web-performance/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;importance of web performance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having the right tools can give your team a shared language for looking at opportunities to make improvements.

At FullStory, we&amp;#x27;ve found significant value in making this data transparently available to the entire product organization. In this post we’ll discuss our rationale for democratizing cloud cost data, how we implemented it, and some of the tangible benefits that we’ve seen thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Creation of the Costs program&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Standing up a Costs program was one of the first orders of business for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/technical-program-management-why-we-started-a-tpm-team&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Technical Program Management team&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after the team was founded in early 2020. At the outset, we identified three outcomes that we wanted to achieve with the Costs program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Cloud expenditures are well-understood and predictable.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cloud costs have a tremendous impact on key financial metrics like gross margins and cost of goods sold, and directly influence our pricing and go-to-market strategies. Understanding and attributing every dollar of our cloud spend will become increasingly important as our company matures. Being able to predict our costs over a longer time horizon helps our Finance team plan more confidently, and also enables us to receive discounts from our cloud provider (Google) by committing to future usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Cost information is transparently available to product teams, allowing them to make informed tradeoff decisions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our goal here is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to make our product teams hyper-fixated on minimizing costs. FullStory is in growth mode, and engineers should mostly be concerned with developing new features and scaling our infrastructure rather than shaving a few dollars off of our cloud bill. However, if done properly, we find there are numerous benefits to providing teams with visibility into the cost of the services they own. First, it enables engineers to discuss and reason about costs during the design process, leading to more scalable and sustainable architectural decisions. Second, an unexpected spike in costs often uncovers an operational issue or bug that needs to be corrected. And third, transparent cost data also helps surface low-hanging fruit: changes that don&amp;#x27;t require much engineering effort but result in massive needle-moving cost savings for the company. Overall, our viewpoint is that cost should be just one of many inputs that factor into a team’s decision-making and prioritization processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Costs are minimized without sacrificing engineering velocity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is a counterweight to the previous point. If we start to notice that we’re spending so much effort on minimizing costs that it’s actually slowing us down, then we need to re-evaluate our priorities. There is certainly a point of diminishing returns, beyond which it requires much greater effort to achieve smaller and smaller cost savings. Teams should always feel comfortable raising a red flag if they feel that we’re over-indexing on costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technical implementation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to achieve our goal of democratized cost data, we needed a pipeline to transform raw Google Cloud billing data into actionable insights. We defined three major deliverables to address our use cases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An easy-to-use SQL table that could be queried by humans or consumed by other tools,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dashboards in our business intelligence tool (Looker) for those who prefer visual exploration of the data, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated Slack alerts to notify us when a service experiences a cost spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Single Source of Truth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first deliverable was a SQL table to display daily cost data in an approachable, easy-to-understand format. This would serve as our source of truth and would be a prerequisite for the later deliverables. Each row would represent the cost incurred by a particular microservice within FullStory’s architecture for its usage of a specific Google Cloud resource. For example, one row could indicate the cost of Network Inter Zone Egress attributed to FullStory’s `frida-memcache` service for a given day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The desired schema for our SQL table.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To arrive at a table like this, we began with raw Google Cloud billing data. We used GCP’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/export-data-bigquery&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;main billing export&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-usage-metering&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kubernetes cluster resource usage export&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to pipe the raw data into Google BigQuery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Transforming this raw data into a useful format was a major project unto itself (though fortunately, much of this had been completed prior to the TPM team&amp;#x27;s involvement). A SQL query was created to combine the main billing data with the Kubernetes cluster usage data, and the result was a simplified table grouped by date, service, and GCP resource. We made extensive use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-labels&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;labels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in order to achieve service attribution, and we configured our infrastructure so that service labels were automatically applied to Google Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine instances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, in order to get this on rails, we needed to turn our existing query into a more permanent table. We opted to use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/views-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;BigQuery view&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (essentially a virtual table). Once set up, the view could be leveraged in a variety of ways: it could be queried directly by human users, consumed by other tools, or integrated into &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/connected-sheets&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Connected Sheets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data exploration and visualization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having our cost data in BigQuery was great for our SQL-savvy users, but we also wanted the data to be accessible to FullStorians without SQL experience (or who simply preferred to interact with the data in a visual way). Looker is our business intelligence tool which sits atop our BigQuery data warehouse, and it is perfectly suited for this use case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To surface the cost data within the Looker UI, we first created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/lookml-terms-and-concepts#view&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;View&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that referenced the underlying BigQuery fields. Then we added an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/lookml-terms-and-concepts#explore&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Explore&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so that any of our Looker users could drill into the data. Finally, we made several &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.looker.com/exploring-data/saving-and-editing-looks&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Looks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (pre-built visualizations) to give users a starting point for answering common cost-related questions. The two main Looks we created were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;GCP Costs by Service&lt;/i&gt;. For a given GCP project, this Look lets us visualize costs grouped by the various services within FullStory’s architecture. This gives us a macro perspective of which services are the main drivers of our cloud costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;GCP Service Costs by Resource&lt;/i&gt;. For a given service, this Look lets us further examine the cost broken down by the specific GCP resources used by that service. This includes Google Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine (CPU, memory, and disk), networking, and various hosted services such as Google Cloud Storage and Datastore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bonus! To quickly navigate to this Look for a particular service, we can combine Google Chrome’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95426&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;custom search engine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; functionality with Looker’s ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.looker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023571954-Override-Look-Filters-in-the-URL&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;override filters via URL parameters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This enables us to enter a service name and go directly to the Look with the desired service pre-populated in the filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proactive alerting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At this point we had truly made our cost data accessible to anyone in the organization who desired it- no SQL experience required. This was a great achievement! However, in order to stay on top of the cost of their services, product teams would still need to remember to manually run a query or check Looker from time to time. To use FullStory parlance, this was not a very &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/3-steps-to-build-bionics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;bionic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solution. This brings us to the &lt;i&gt;pièce de résistance&lt;/i&gt; of our cost data pipeline: automated cost spike alerting. The ultimate goal here was to receive Slack messages when a service experienced a substantial cost spike on a day-over-day, week-over-week, or month-over-month basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To implement this, we first created a Look in Looker for each of our desired alerts (e.g. “GCP Cost Spike Day-over-Day”). Each Look was formatted as a table displaying the service name, the cost value for the most recent day, the cost value for the previous day, the percent change, and a boolean field to indicate whether an alert-worthy spike had occurred. The boolean field was based on both the absolute value of the cost as well as the percent change; in other words, a 50% increase for a service that costs $2 is probably not worthy of an alert, but a 50% increase for a $2,000 service certainly would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once each Look was in place, we set up &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.looker.com/sharing-and-publishing/scheduling-and-sharing/delivering-looks-explores#delivery_options_for_webhooks&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;scheduled webhooks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to run each Look on the appropriate cadence and send the results in JSON format to a Zapier webhook URL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the Zapier side, we created a Zap to catch the webhook payloads from Looker. The Zap executes some Python code to parse the relevant values from the JSON payload. Then, if there is a nonzero number of alerts to send, the Zap will format the Slack messages and post them to the relevant channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, we can see our cost alerts in Slack! The message includes all the necessary context, as well as a link that navigates directly to that service’s cost visualization in Looker for further investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our Technical Program Management team will triage these alerts as they arrive and collaborate with the service owners as necessary. We also regularly tune our alerting thresholds to ensure that these messages are always relevant and actionable in order to avoid alert fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the ~18 months since standing up the Costs program and democratizing our cloud cost data, we’ve seen numerous tangible benefits across the product organization. In particular:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modeling the cost of a proposed architectural or product change has become immensely easier. Previously this process would involve ad-hoc analysis with data cobbled together from various sources. Now, using the BigQuery view as our single source of truth, we can &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/connected-sheets&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;connect to Google Sheets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and create models using real, live data. For example, using the BigQuery data, we recently created a “functional cost model” to better understand how each area of the FullStory platform (data ingestion, processing, storage, search, etc) contributes to our unit economics. This model has been instrumental in helping us confidently make major product strategy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slack-based cost alerts regularly surface unexpected spikes that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. Not only has this led to substantial monetary savings, but we’ve also identified misbehaving services and fixed bugs prior to them being noticed by customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost mindfulness has become ingrained in our engineering culture without slowing us down. Now that we have a common dataset and vocabulary to talk about cost, engineers are more likely to discuss cost earlier in the software development lifecycle. Engineers have also started proactively coming to the Technical Program Management team to talk through the cost implications of their designs. And even if we miss something in the design phase, we can rest assured that our Slack alerting will quickly catch any unforeseen spikes and notify us accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Overall, we’ve found that making cost data easily accessible has been a huge net-positive for our product organization. By explicitly communicating our intentions and goals throughout this initiative, we were able to achieve the positive effects without sacrificing engineering velocity or culture. Stay tuned for Part II of this series to learn about how we’ve operationalized our cost data and used it as the foundation for more sophisticated systems and processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The series continues in part II: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/increasing-cost-awareness-by-modeling-cost-saving-projects/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Increasing cost awareness by modeling cost-saving projects&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Increasing cost awareness by modeling cost-saving projects]]></title><description><![CDATA[Part II of a series about how FullStory’s Technical Program Management team increases cost awareness by modeling cost-savings projects.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/increasing-cost-awareness-by-modeling-cost-saving-projects</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/increasing-cost-awareness-by-modeling-cost-saving-projects</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ben McCormack]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In our recent post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/democratizing-cloud-cost-data-to-empower-product-teams/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;democratizing cloud cost data to empower product teams&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we laid out the three initial goals of the Costs program:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud expenditures are well-understood and predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost information is transparently available to product teams, allowing them to make informed tradeoff decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costs are minimized without sacrificing engineering velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our initial efforts built a foundation for engineers to easily access cost data and proactive alerts to draw attention to services experiencing an unexpected rise in costs. These tools have been helpful in gaining a baseline understanding of costs across FullStory services as well as being alerted to sudden cost changes. But how do we gain insight into cost-saving opportunities that may be hidden within our existing infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Earlier this year, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/technical-program-management-why-we-started-a-tpm-team&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Technical Program Management team&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worked with a group of engineers at FullStory where we tried to answer the question, “If we wanted to make FullStory as inexpensive as possible while still offering the same amount of value to customers, what could we do?” The goal wasn’t to force ourselves to prioritize the projects we identified, but rather to further increase our understanding of how our existing services operate and what opportunities exist to save money, should we decide to prioritize those projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modeling the costs of an engineering project&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To start, we asked engineers if they already had existing projects in mind where they expected we could cut costs. Engineers who spend time in a mature codebase tend to have a backlog of projects they would implement to make their services more efficient, given the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using this list of engineering projects as a starting point, we would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/democratizing-cloud-cost-data-to-empower-product-teams/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;look at our cloud billing line items&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the most recent month and make a list of the existing costs that would be affected by each project. We’d then go line by line with engineering and ask, “How much would we save on this specific line item if we implemented this project?” At the end of this exercise, we’d have a number we could use for estimated annual cost savings. Here’s a simple fictionalized example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In our first pass at the spreadsheet, we would use broad strokes to calculate estimated savings. We’d ask for rough guesses from engineering about how to discount particular line items on the bill. This helped us dial in the order of magnitude of potential savings for each line item so we could better determine how much further effort was needed to validate the cost savings model. For projects that had a relatively small effect on our overall GCP bill, a rough estimate was fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For projects with a more significant impact on cloud costs, e.g. where potential savings represented multiple percentage points of the annual bill, we would spend more time validating our cost model. This could involve working with engineering on an additional model from the bottom up (vs top down from the GCP bill), where we laid out assumptions based on how our code works and could then model out potential changes to our implementation that could generate cost savings. Multiple models increased clarity and gave us confidence in the estimated cost savings, which was essential for larger projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s worth pointing out that for projects with a potentially large payoff, there’s usually significant effort to implement the proposed solution. If these cost-saving opportunities were obvious and easy, they almost certainly would have been implemented already through the normal course of doing business. One of the positive side effects of this process is that projects that require a lot of engineering effort can emerge as “not worth it” when you realize the cost savings will be much lower than originally anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compiling projects into a spreadsheet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After coming up with an exhaustive list of cost-saving opportunities, we then added all of the potential projects to a spreadsheet:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By listing all of the project ideas in a single spreadsheet, stakeholders were able to get a bird&amp;#x27;s eye view of all of the potential savings opportunities available. It also helped put things in perspective. Low-effort projects with high savings potential immediately rose to the top, whereas we would deprioritize projects with high effort and low cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One surprise was that we realized some of the projects would actually &lt;i&gt;cost&lt;/i&gt; us money. An idea might have sounded good when we talked about it out loud at an engineering meeting, but when we modeled it out, it ended up being a net loss rather than a gain. Having these items on the spreadsheet gave us a reference point should that project arise in further discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;To save or not to save&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One of the questions we had to ask was, “How much time and effort should our engineering team spend prioritizing cost-saving efforts?” Every engineering project has an opportunity cost. Given mutually exclusive projects, one that will cut costs and another one that will increase revenue, we have to make a decision about which one to prioritize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory’s current stage, we’re continuing to prioritize growth and scale, which means we tend to focus on the features and services that help us to earn new business and expand the value we deliver to existing customers. Dedicated cost-cutting efforts usually have a negative net present value when factoring in the opportunity costs of research and development intended to grow the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Which brings us to an important question: What’s the point of going through the exercise of modeling cost savings projects with engineers if you’re not going to prioritize them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further increasing cost awareness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By going through the exercise of modeling cost-saving opportunities, we’re able to have our cake and eat it too. After collaborating with our engineers, we now have a list of shovel-ready projects that we can pick up should we ever need to prioritize cost-saving efforts. Some projects seem immediately obvious while others will sit on the backburner. But even in an environment where growth wins over cost savings, this effort pays dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Individual engineers throughout the organization have become more aware of costs, which is one of the goals of the Costs program at FullStory. This means that the same engineers who will be deployed on R&amp;amp;D projects for the purpose of increasing revenue will have developed better instincts about how their services contribute to costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Perhaps the most important outcome of the Costs program at FullStory is that &lt;b&gt;costs are minimized without sacrificing engineering velocity.&lt;/b&gt; The real outcome of modeling potential cost savings isn’t just a spreadsheet with a list of ways to save money. It’s a deep awareness of costs such that cost-saving efforts become seamlessly integrated into the normal course of engineering work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[4 ways to improve your holiday shopping experience, according to consumers]]></title><description><![CDATA[We surveyed 1,600+ US consumers to find out how and where they plan to shop for holiday gifts—plus what they expect from retailers. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/improve-holiday-shopping-experience-consumer-survey</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/improve-holiday-shopping-experience-consumer-survey</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’ve shopped for nearly anything in the past several months—from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/28/business/auto-industry-supply-chain-problems/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;cars&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/procurement-recycled-coffee-cup-sustainability/606777/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;coffee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;— you’ve noticed retailers are facing some challenges: Stock is low, shipping times are long, and there isn’t much anyone can do about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As we approach the holiday shopping season, both retailers and consumers are concerned about the shopping experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory recently surveyed 1,600+ US consumers to find out how and where they plan to shop for holiday gifts—plus what they expect from retailers. Here’s one notable finding: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nearly 85% of consumers say that a great digital experiences is &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;as &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;or &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;more important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; than a great in-store experience.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s more, nearly one in three consumers say they’ll shop online more this holiday season than last. And with higher consumer expectations and fierce competition, brands should be taking steps to ensure that their digital experience passes muster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our consumer survey revealed several valuable—and sometimes surprising—insights about what consumers want and expect to see from retailers this holiday season. Here are answers to four key questions retailers might have this season, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;To see the full results of our 2021 Consumer Holiday Survey, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-state-of-digital-shopping-2021/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;download the report here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. An item is out of stock. What should I do? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Supply chain shortages, shipping delays, and myriad other factors mean that low inventory on certain items is inevitable this holiday season. While this isn’t ideal for shoppers, there are some things retailers can do to soften the out-of-stock blow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The top thing consumers want is for the retailer &lt;b&gt;to show alternative items that &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;are &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;in stock (66% of respondents). &lt;/b&gt;For bonus points, 60% of respondents say they would like retailers to communicate early, alerting them that an item is out of stock or won’t arrive in time &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; they add it to their cart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;51% of consumers would like the option to be notified when their desired item becomes available again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;43% want retailers to remove out-of-stock items from promotional materials and search results &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The key here is communication. If your business is experiencing low inventory, let your customers know as soon as possible, and recommend similar products when possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. What’s the top issue  I should prioritize fixing before the holidays? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your ecommerce website is a complex organism. Bugs, glitches, and otherwise imperfect experiences happen, and you can’t address every single one of them at once. You need to prioritize based on impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With that in mind, we asked consumers which common site issues they find &lt;i&gt;the most frustrating&lt;/i&gt; when shopping online. Here’s a list of the top five issues that frustrate shoppers to determine which fixes should be at the top of your to-do list. In short, &lt;b&gt;teams should focus on fixing shopping cart concerns&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. The shopping cart won’t complete the transaction (37%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. The shopping cart won’t accept a gift code (36%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Pages won’t load, the site times out, or I get a 404 error (34%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. I can’t find the product or sizing information I need (30%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. I can’t navigate or browse to the items I want to buy (24%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Need more guidance? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/strategies-to-improve-checkout-flow-and-reduce-cart-abandonment&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Here are five ways to improve your ecommerce experience.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Is the mobile experience really &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;that&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; important? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The short answer: &lt;b&gt;Yes.&lt;/b&gt; The amount of transactions that take place via mobile device—from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/quick-service-restaurants-digital-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ordering takeout&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to banking to booking flights—has rapidly accelerated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/first-phone-anniversary-2016-12&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the rise of smartphones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And holiday shopping is no exception. According to our survey, 81% of consumers say they will do &lt;b&gt;at least some&lt;/b&gt; of their holiday shopping from their phone in 2021, and 58% say that &lt;b&gt;at least half&lt;/b&gt; of their holiday shopping will be conducted via mobile device. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The implications of this data become clear when we consider the fact that 46% of consumers report running into more issues when shopping on their phones than when shopping on desktop. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The takeaway, of course, is that retailers who focus on offering an optimized, user-friendly mobile shopping experience will set themselves apart from the competition in the eyes of the customer. Not sure where to start? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/improve-ecommerce-experience-DXI/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Here are three ways to improve your mobile ecommerce experience.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Should I offer “hybrid” shopping? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The past two years’ precautions and restrictions have forced businesses of all types to get creative in how they deliver their products and services. For retailers, one of the results has been “hybrid” shopping experiences that combine some elements of digital shopping with the brick-and-mortar experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some examples of ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/retailx-2021-DXI/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;improve the hybrid shopping experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; include buy online, pick-up in-store (BOPIS), curbside pickup, virtual shopping/fittings, and more. With the reopening of brick-and-mortar stores, many retailers are wondering if it’s worthwhile to continue offering these extra services and shopping options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;According to our survey, the answer is a resounding, “Yes.” &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of respondents, 23% of respondents said they would use hybrid shopping options often, while 5% said this would be their primary method of shopping if made available. Another 47% of consumer say they would use hybrid shopping experiences occasionally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In all, this amounts to three out of four shoppers who would take advantage of hybrid shopping options at least some of the time—which clearly demonstrates the necessity of continuing to offer services like BOPIS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[FullStory's Series D accelerates investment in Digital Experience Intelligence]]></title><description><![CDATA[Today marks a major milestone for FullStory: closing our Series D funding round of a little over $100 million, resulting in a $1.8 billion valuation. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/series-d-announcement</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/series-d-announcement</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Voigt]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As indicated by the title of this post, I have exciting news to share! But first, a short aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Real talk: I struggle whenever we write announcements for financing events. Like a grouchy old man—which, increasingly, I am—my inner voice rants:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The tech world is focused on the wrong thing! No one gives you a high-five when you refinance your house, so why do they when you raise capital for a business? We should crow about customer wins, new capabilities, and amazing FullStorians—the things that matter!” (shakes fist)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Then I snap out of it and get practical. Funding provides the fuel to accelerate our mission, hire more brilliant FullStorians, build inspired new products, reach more customers, improve more visits—and win this massive and emerging category!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I also used to cringe at the notion of sharing private valuations publicly. But, I get it now. However imperfect a measure, our valuation is a signal of the enormous market opportunity and our potential to seize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With all that in mind, I am super excited about our Series D fundraising round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you need to know about our fundraise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today marks a major milestone in FullStory’s journey: &lt;b&gt;closing our Series D funding round of a little over $100 million, resulting in a $1.8 billion valuation.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oversubscribed.asp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;oversubscribed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; investment was led by new investor Permira, alongside all of FullStory’s existing investors including Kleiner Perkins, GV, Stripes, Dell Technologies Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and Glynn Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Want to read more about why Permira invested in FullStory?

Simply put, FullStory’s leadership team, along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/about-us#investors&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;our investors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are incredibly optimistic about the journey ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where we’re investing next&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our first order of business is continuing our rapidly scaling enterprise growth.

In an era where our online interactions generate increasingly more data, the way organizations handle that sensitive information is under the microscope—and rightfully so. With this investment, we’ll accelerate our commitment to Privacy-by-Default—enhancing a platform that is able to abstract patterns and anomalies without compromising private information, ensuring total user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Speaking of pattern matching and anomaly detection, we’re eager to use this investment to uncover experience improvement signals and push the boundaries of the DXI platform with  innovation in data science and machine learning.

Created by Clayton Christensen&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/marketing-and-the-jobs-to-be-done-framework/#fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, author and Harvard Business School Professor, &amp;quot;Jobs to Be Done theory&amp;quot; or “JTBD&amp;quot; orients the team around the customer need, that is, the problem the consumer needs to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Applied to marketing, Jobs to Be Done theory requires you tell the story of what the product &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; for the consumer—not it&amp;#x27;s latest whiz-bang features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re looking to apply JTBD to marketing, you can start with a brief primer on the concept below. Then, we&amp;#x27;ll get specific and hear what Professor Christensen says about JTBD and marketing. Finally, we&amp;#x27;ll share case studies and troubleshoot marketing pitfalls that can be avoided using Jobs to Be Done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Jobs to Be Done framework: a primer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before we dive into marketing with Jobs to Be Done, let&amp;#x27;s refresh on the basics of the theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Jobs to Be Done teases out why a customer “hires” a product or service in the first place. The questions below can help tease out JTBD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does your product or service &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;actually do &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;for the customer? &lt;/b&gt;While not intended to be a literal question, it can be helpful to start by listing out product &lt;i&gt;benefits &lt;/i&gt;while throttling any discussion of &lt;i&gt;features&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maslow’s hierarchy of needs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  — &lt;b&gt;how does the product fill these needs? &lt;/b&gt;Start broadly and then get more specific. The best products will satisfy more levels of the hierarchy. Per Christensen, “With few exceptions, every job people need or want to do has a social, a functional, and an emotional dimension.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What product or service was “fired” and replaced by the current product? &lt;/b&gt;You can tease out why new customers choose your product or service by reflecting on what the customer used before they switched to your product. From there, look at the why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If this is your first exposure to JTBD, you&amp;#x27;ll benefit from reading our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/&quot;&gt;overview of the Jobs to Be Done framework&lt;/a&gt;. You could also dive deep by picking up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/books/jobs-to-be-done&quot;&gt;Intercom&amp;#x27;s book on JTBD&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, let&amp;#x27;s dive into applying JTBD to marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Marketing with the Jobs to Be Done framework&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Marketing is about how products and services are presented and sold. Here&amp;#x27;s how it&amp;#x27;s defined:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the 2005 article &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2005/12/marketing-malpractice-the-cause-and-the-cure&quot;&gt;The Cause and the Cure of Marketing Malpractice&lt;/a&gt;, Clayton Christensen explained the marketer&amp;#x27;s job succinctly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marketer’s task is to understand what jobs periodically arise in customers’ lives for which they might hire products the company could make. If a marketer can understand the job, design a product and associated experiences in purchase and use to do that job, and deliver it in a way that reinforces its intended use, then when new customers find themselves needing to get that job done, they will hire that product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Marketing, in effect, is about telling the story of what a product &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; for the consumer. When (and if) products meet the expectations set by the marketing messaging, the person will look to “hire” that brand or product the next time they have that need. The best marketing reinforces these connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What brands do Jobs to Be Done marketing well?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Where ever you can identify brands that have strong associations with doing specific jobs you’ll find successful businesses. Consider a few jobs you might find you need doing below and fill in the blank with the first brand you’d hire to do them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to furnish a dorm room: ______&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to answer a question: ______&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need a serious energy boost: ______&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need a gift for an upcoming party but have no time to shop: ______&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to blow your nose: ______&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Very likely, IKEA, Google, Red Bull, Amazon, and Kleenex all came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By aligning a JTBD with a brand, the customer reduces their need to think. The stronger the association between a brand and a job, the harder it is for competitors to move in on your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;☞ The best marketing clearly articulates the problem consumers have, and goes on to explain how the product or service &lt;i&gt;solves that problem.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Jobs to Be Done marketing asserts, &amp;quot;You have a problem. Our product solves it by doing [X] better than any other product.&amp;quot; This basic structure orients marketing messaging to the expected outcomes of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But sometimes it&amp;#x27;s not easy to figure out the &lt;i&gt;job&lt;/i&gt;. For that, consider the following.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What are existing customers &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; using our product to do?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To understand how customers actually use your product you must conduct research. You can ask customers directly, but as Christensen’s “milkshakes” story reveals, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/&quot;&gt;customers aren’t always great at understanding the reasons for their decisions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So consider becoming a collector of customer use-cases. For example, ask your customers to tell you a story about how they use the product — that’s what we do with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://fullstory.com/blog/tag/use-cases&quot;&gt;FullStory customer use-cases&lt;/a&gt;. Use-cases serve double-duty by informing our marketing &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;  product teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Twitter can also be useful for listening to customers — Joseph Todardo shared:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design community is very lively on Twitter. That just gives us another opportunity to back up the general consensus, to see if something is just what a couple people are talking about, or if it’s part of the broader dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re a SaaS company or a large portion of your product is experienced online, use FullStory to search your customers based on how they interact with your product — e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/search-bounce-rate-form-abandonment-feature-adoption-javascript-errors/&quot;&gt;what features are they using&lt;/a&gt;? Based on these behavior-based customer segments, you can then watch session replay and tease out insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reinforce the association of product with job done&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your customers are happily using the product in a way that is different from how your product team intended or how your marketing team presented it, guess what? Your product got hired to do a job it didn’t even have to interview for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is a marketing freebie. Simply understand their use and reinforce the association they already have. That&amp;#x27;s what Arm &amp;amp; Hammer did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Arm &amp;amp; Hammer baking soda — Case study&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2005/12/marketing-malpractice-the-cause-and-the-cure&quot;&gt;Christensen’s 2005 paper&lt;/a&gt; he shares the story of how after 100 years in existence Arm &amp;amp; Hammer began paying attention to how customers were using their product — that is, baking soda — and proceeded to reinforce the association:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late 1960s [Arm &amp;amp; Hammer] began observational research to understand the diverse circumstances in which consumers found themselves with a job to do where Arm &amp;amp; Hammer could be hired to help customers. They found a few consumers adding the product to laundry detergent, a few others mixing it into toothpaste, some sprinkling it on the carpet, and still others placing open boxes in the refrigerator. &lt;b&gt;There was a plethora of jobs out there needing to get done, but most customers did not know that they could hire Arm &amp;amp; Hammer baking soda for these cleaning and freshening jobs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Arm &amp;amp; Hammer markets the jobs baking soda can do right on the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using this observational research, Arm &amp;amp; Hammer developed new products explicitly for the “jobs” their customers were already tackling with baking soda and adopted “a communication strategy that [helped consumers] realize that when they find themselves needing to get one of these jobs done, here is a product that they can trust to do it well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Arm &amp;amp; Hammer’s pure baking soda business now accounts for only 10% of their revenue — the rest is toothpaste, deodorant, laundry detergent, and countless other baking soda-powered products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To this day, Arm &amp;amp; Hammer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.armandhammer.com/&quot;&gt;uses their website&lt;/a&gt; to share product uses while asking what “secret solutions” their customers have for their product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Snickers — Case study&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’ve followed Snickers candy bars through the ages, they have frequently taken a Jobs to be Done approach to their marketing. If you happened to watch the 1992 Olympics, you likely caught Snickers commercials on the television and can hear that husky voice sing, “There’s a hunger inside you … Snickers satisfies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO-ggqzl-wk&quot;&gt;see this classic&lt;/a&gt; or jump back to the 1980s with this Snickers TV ad that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWBAvE6yqUs&quot;&gt;nails JTBD&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got deadlines to meet. I can’t let something like hunger get in the way. Snickers fills me up until I can grab a meal. It cuts the hunger. Let’s me take care of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Snickers has aligned itself with meal replacement bars (or staving off “hanger”) as much as it has with candy bars. Snickers satisfies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Snickers re-uses their highly recognizable brand but with a twist — putting the job being done right on the wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Identify and stop ineffective marketing campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Marketers are often swayed to chasing the next big thing — “Look, squirrel!” Gut-checking marketing campaign ideas by looking for clear ties back to the customer problem (or job) being solved can stop these flights of fancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To assess the merits of a particular marketing campaign, ask the following Jobs to Be Done-related questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How well does the marketing campaign clarify &lt;/b&gt;the alignment of what the product does to the need the product is being hired for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the objectives of the marketing campaign &lt;/b&gt;(e.g. awareness, consideration, purchase)? How do those objectives support the alignment of the product with the job it’s being hired to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How well is the campaign targeted to a specific audience&lt;/b&gt; — that is, an audience that is likely to need the product? (Note: if you’re segmenting by demographics, there’s a good chance you need to do more precise targeting.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting: We’ve built a great product but no one is buying. What’s wrong?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When marketing efforts are falling flat on their face, something is likely broken. The most likely explanations usually involve one of two things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Audience mismatch. &lt;/b&gt;That is, the audience your marketing is running against doesn’t have the need you’ve articulated, or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unclear marketing message. &lt;/b&gt;If you’re certain you’ve targeted the right audience, there’s an excellent chance your marketing efforts are failing to articulate the nature of your product and it does a specific job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In either of the above cases (or both), it’s necessary to step back and reassess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For online businesses, metrics like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/search-bounce-rate-form-abandonment-feature-adoption-javascript-errors/&quot;&gt;bounce rate and feature adoption&lt;/a&gt; are both indicators that something is broken. If you’re offering free trials of your product, measure sign-ups by the marketing channels driving them. If certain channels are working poorly, there’s a good chance it’s either an audience or messaging mismatch — or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Don’t believe the hype&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s easy for marketers to buy into the hype — salespeople have this same problem. It’s next to impossible for marketers &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to excited about the product, the latest features, etc. It’s also easy to get excited about the future of a product — a vision for how the product will be in lieu of paying attention to how the product is seen by customers today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hype Town is a dangerous place to live. For one, while your most enthusiastic consumers might buy into the excitement you’re spreading, when the product doesn’t live up to expectations, customers are going to wind up being let down. Secondly, the more disconnected marketers become from the product reality experienced by customers — that is, the jobs customers use your product to do — the more the marketing messaging will under-perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Returning to and reapplying the Jobs to Be Done framework can serve as an important gut-check for marketers. The two-pronged approach of listening to customer use-cases and observing how customers actually use your product can go a long way to grounding marketers in reality. (Online businesses and SaaS companies will benefit from using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;customer experience tools like session replay&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How we&amp;#x27;ve put the JTBD to work for FullStory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You may not be familiar with FullStory, so a brief introduction: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#finding-the-right-session-replay-tool&quot;&gt;FullStory is a session replay tool&lt;/a&gt;—it&amp;#x27;s like a web analytics tool that goes beyond metrics to showing you what real users are actually doing on your site (or app). It does this in a literal way, and the output is something akin to a DVR of user behavior. Still don&amp;#x27;t quite get it? That&amp;#x27;s okay. It&amp;#x27;s hard to understand something you&amp;#x27;ve never used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Which is why JTBD is a useful approach for marketing FullStory. Using JTBD we market the problems our product can help solve. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem of &lt;b&gt;providing the best customer support&lt;/b&gt;, and how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/session-replay-customer-support/&quot;&gt;FullStory gives support professionals the needed context to painlessly help customers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem of &lt;b&gt;fixing bugs and other software errors&lt;/b&gt;, and how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/debugging-with-session-replay/&quot;&gt;FullStory helps engineers and developers by reproducing bugs on demand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem of &lt;b&gt;analyzing A/B tests, assessing the effectiveness of landing pages, and other conversion-oriented efforts&lt;/b&gt;, and how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/session-replay-conversion-rate-optimization/&quot;&gt;FullStory provides the nuanced details needed to drive conversion optimizations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#problems-solved-by-session-replay&quot;&gt;many more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Putting the Jobs to Be Done framework to work in crafting specific messages helps us both identify the proper audiences and serve up the message most likely to resonate with those audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But nothing markets better than using the product&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The most effective marketing is the product, itself. But if the job the product does for consumers fails to be articulated in such a way that it triggers people to make the association, the marketing will fall flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Great marketing tells the story of the product in such a way that it’s grounded in the needs of the consumer. The application of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/&quot;&gt;Clayton Christensen’s Jobs to Be Done framework&lt;/a&gt; can go a long way to helping marketers stay grounded and tell better product (and services) stories — and by extension, find and sell to more customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might be familiar with Clay Christensen from his works on disruptive innovation as explained in the book &lt;i&gt;The Innovator&amp;#x27;s Dilemma&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/marketing-and-the-jobs-to-be-done-framework/#fnref1&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The death of identity: Knowing your customer in the age of data privacy]]></title><description><![CDATA[As privacy demands grow, businesses have the chance to rethink their relationship with customer data to focus on first-party and behavioral data.

It originally appeared in &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/the-death-of-identity-knowing-your-customer-in-the-age-of-data-privacy/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Know your customer”&lt;/b&gt; is one of the foundational concepts of business. In the digital age, companies have learned much about their customers by forming individual profiles from third-party cookies, social content, purchased demographics and more. But in the face of growing demands for privacy, businesses have the opportunity to overhaul their relationship with customer data to focus solely on first-party data and patterns of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Companies have employed digital analytics, advertising and marketing solutions to track customers and connect their behaviors across touch points. This enabled the creation of data profiles, which have been leveraged to deliver personalized experiences that resonate through relevance and context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Expect more scrutiny around privacy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, however, this practice of profiling and identifying customers is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Regulators are adopting new data and consumer privacy legislation, most recently seen with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/2021-colorado-privacy-act-passes-and-4993635/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Colorado Privacy Act&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, Apple’s privacy implementations in iOS 14.8 and iOS 15 have been adopted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com/article/ios-14-5-users-opt-out-of-ad-tracking/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;an estimated 96% of users&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who have opted to stop apps from tracking their activity for ad targeting. And Google has announced it will no longer support third-party cookies and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnet.com/news/google-will-stop-selling-ads-based-on-tracked-individual-browsing-history/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;will stop tracking on an individual basis altogether through its Chrome browser&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While these developments threaten to upend how digital marketing is performed today, they signal a necessary, and effective, shift in the ways brands will understand their customers in the future. Prioritizing individual profiles is far from the fastest or most effective way to understand and address customers’ intentions, needs and struggles. Brands don’t need to know who; they need to know what and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), companies can process and interpret first-party data in real time and develop actionable behavioral intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pattern analysis as a way forward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The security industry, which I’ve been involved in for 35 years, provides a template for the path forward. Historically, security professionals have sought to pinpoint individuals’ signatures in order to identify, thwart or at least prosecute bad actors. However, the last few years have marked the rise of some incredibly promising companies and approaches that leverage patterns of signals to proactively surface and stop threats before they happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Similarly, when it comes to surfacing threats and opportunities for digital business, companies can leverage Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) gleaned from behavioral patterns and context across massive behavioral datasets. These DXI platforms can layer ML and AI onto complete, retroactive behavioral and session data to generate immediate, rich insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Real-time analysis can help companies identify patterns of behavior to understand how customers engage, and why—all while protecting their privacy. Based on these insights, businesses can provide better products, services and experiences through:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;New insights and opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Behavioral analysis can be used to cluster users who take similar types of actions and target them more intelligently, while also discovering patterns that can lead to new revenue opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For instance, a large home improvement retailer used data surfaced through FullStory’s DXI platform to identify a spike in the sale of garage mats during the COVID-19 quarantine. Deeper analysis of behavioral patterns revealed that customers were also buying other materials and equipment consistent with building home gyms. Based on this insight, the company updated its merchandising and marketing strategies to capitalize on the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Improved customer satisfaction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Companies no longer need a trove of personally identifiable information to offer great digital experiences, or to detect flaws in subpar ones. Rather than waiting for a call center complaint or negative survey feedback, businesses can proactively detect and take fast action on frustration signals such as “rage clicks” or repeated page reloads that occur when visitors don’t see an expected change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pinching and zooming behavior can indicate that user experiences need to be better tailored for mobile screen sizes, whereas content highlighting or deep scrolling lends new insights into key interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Better security&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By detecting patterns in anomalous behavior, DXI platforms can flag outliers as they occur, enabling companies to counter threats sooner. With aggregate behavioral data as a guide, businesses can pinpoint risks in advance and take preventive action against potential breaches or fraud attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First-party data for the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Companies that have long relied on digital profiling to better understand customers and drive business decisions have been stymied by recent developments to curb third-party cookies and tracking. But by harnessing the power of AI to process vast amounts of first-party data about behavior—not individuals—companies can know and serve their customers better than ever while protecting user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Good and Bad of Product Friction]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn how to identify product friction, solve for different types, and why it's not always a bad thing.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fixing-product-friction-at-fullstory/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fixing-product-friction-at-fullstory/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Product managers and UX teams may not always see eye to eye, but there’s surely agreement on one thing: if a product, website, or app isn&amp;#x27;t easy to use, there’s work still to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In essence, friction can be the gateway to becoming your product’s best version. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Anyone that has ever built a product knows that there are constant revisions. Understanding customers’ needs is vital for success. But how can you pinpoint these friction points?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep reading to learn how teams can identify product friction, how to solve for different types, and how friction is not always bad—in fact, it could be the key to new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The power of product friction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what is the real impact of product friction? And more importantly, what can be learned from it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Friction is any time that customers have a goal in mind and they&amp;#x27;re unable to achieve that goal. They&amp;#x27;re not able to do the one thing they want to do—which is exactly what we want them to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are two high-level types of friction:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Function friction&lt;/b&gt;: The friction of the customer experience that doesn’t allow them to complete their goal. They keep getting an error message and cannot move forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opportunity friction&lt;/b&gt;: The friction of a customer using your product in a workflow, and it hasn&amp;#x27;t yet evolved to the point where it can help them. What they need doesn’t exist within the product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These two levels of friction can fuel your product to evolve to a state where it can meet customers’ needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Prioritizing friction &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Friction may come at you from all angles. You may be in a situation where prioritization of friction is mandatory. Here are some different questions to consider when prioritizing friction points: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which friction impacts revenue the most?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which friction impedes customer satisfaction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which friction affects technical performance and infrastructure? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These answers can help narrow down which friction points maximize business value and don’t hinder customer delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So how do you prioritize something that’s performance-related versus that which drives revenue? In an ideal situation, you shouldn’t have to trade-off between the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The team has to get together and figure out what factors are the most valuable from a business standpoint as well as from a customer standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The tools and processes for understanding friction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A common tool for understanding friction is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/empathy-customer-journey-maps/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;journey map&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As basic as that is, it enables you to understand your customer and the things that they&amp;#x27;re doing that either help them or make things harder for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the highest level, identify areas of opportunity where your product could fit in. To do this, you need to understand what customers are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the goals my customers are trying to achieve? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can my customer persona help? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What factors led to this friction? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the key areas of the workflow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to have a qualitative way of identifying those areas of opportunity, you need the right tools for the job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the power of qualitative and quantitative information, you can obtain analytics and tracking to actually be notified when there is friction. With a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solution like FullStory, you can find frustration heuristics, and identify if someone is expressing negative sentiment towards an experience like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rage Clicking&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can see what that experience looks like and qualitatively become aware of opportunities to go after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to fix the friction when the fix isn&amp;#x27;t working&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So you’ve attempted a friction fix and the needle hasn’t moved. What do you do if the fix didn’t fix it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are two questions to ask about the friction:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did you identify the problem correctly?&lt;/b&gt; As part of that, you define your success criteria with problem identification and the data (or digital intelligence) that backs that up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did the product solve the problem?&lt;/b&gt; You identified the right opportunity and criteria, but the solution just isn’t what it needs to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
This is where a best-in-class DXI tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comes in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watching sessions is a really great way to understand what a customer is experiencing firsthand. And once you know what they are experiencing, talk to customers. It could be as simple as asking, &amp;quot;can you tell me what you think?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Good friction is a real thing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a product manager, you never want to create an experience that&amp;#x27;s going to irritate, frustrate, or make a customer unhappy. Feedback is a gift. From that sense, understanding where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/optimize-user-login-flow-with-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;friction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exists is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a user, there are times where friction is a terrible thing and there&amp;#x27;s no way to spin it in a positive way. There are also plenty of times when friction helps slow the user down in a way that&amp;#x27;s valuable and meaningful to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, if you&amp;#x27;re agreeing to something as part of a sign-up flow, you want to be reminded of what you&amp;#x27;re signing up for. A modal pops up affirming that you want to sign up. Slow UX definitely has a place in design and can be part of a delightful experience, even though it can be friction at that moment. It’s friction with a purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data is the decision-maker for friction &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the highest level, it depends on how much effort or investment it takes to do the thing that you potentially are going to do with that information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DXI solution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to look for examples of friction in onboarding, and build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058890254-Creating-a-Funnel&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;funnel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from sign-up to sale. Then look for the errors in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;frustration signals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Are there ways to identify friction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So whether or not you&amp;#x27;re using a FullStory funnel or some other analytics tool, you want to build all the steps in and look for the drop-offs, and stop friction before it escalates.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

By 2012, Facebook had reached 1 billion members worldwide and acquired Instagram. In 2014 Facebook launched Business Manager, and today seven million companies advertise on the platform. Two years later, Facebook Marketplace was introduced, expanding the company’s footprint even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And those are just some of Facebook’s major milestones. The point is that, when it comes to websites, softwares, and technologies, evolution happens quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And as softwares evolve rapidly, analytics solutions that can adapt to their ever-evolving nuances are needed. Amid all of this change, two major types of analytics have emerged: product analytics and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital experience intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (DXI). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This leads many product leaders to ask: &lt;b&gt;Do I need product analytics or digital experience intelligence? Do I need &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;both&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These are important questions, and, perhaps disappointingly, the answer to each of them is: It depends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your product, service, mobile app, and website are totally unique, and so are your analytics needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here, we’ll provide a high-level overview of three key differences to be aware of between product analytics and DXI to help guide you in choosing the best solution for your team’s needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you want to dive right into the deep end, download the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/compare-product-analytics-digital-experience-analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Product Analytics vs. Digital Experience Intelligence Comparison Guide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; for a comprehensive view of these two solution categories.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are product analytics and digital experience intelligence?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product analytics&lt;/b&gt; platforms are used to answer questions about how users behave in digital products by measuring user behavior and creating digestible visualizations of those measurements. Clicks, page views, and interactions are user behavior metrics typically seen in product analytics. With this data, product teams can learn about user engagement rates, test hypotheses, and understand adoption and retention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital experience intelligence &lt;/b&gt; analyses go further by pairing quantitative data with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replays of actual user sessions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—allowing product teams to see, understand, and empathize with a user’s digital experience. DXI enables teams to discover where users get frustrated, which issues should be prioritized based on revenue impact, and why there might be dips or peaks in KPIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that we have a baseline of what these two types of solutions are designed to do for product teams, let’s look more closely at what differentiates them from one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3 important differences between product analytics and DXI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Difference #1: How data is captured &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Typically, product analytics platforms rely on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/funnel-analysis-for-digital-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;instrumentation for capturing data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that they only track the actions and elements that you specifically tell them to monitor. The downside of this is that you don’t know what you don’t know—so it can be difficult to find trends or anomalies in your data that you weren’t expecting. Plus, manual instrumentation can be very time-consuming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the other hand, the instrumentation approach is conservative in the amount of information collected, so you’re far less likely to capture data that you didn’t intend to—potentially causing huge data privacy headaches for your organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With digital experience intelligence, all user interaction data is captured and indexed instrumentation-free, so you’ll never have to tell the platform what it is you want to monitor. All the data is there at your fingertips from installation. What’s more, industry-leading DXI platforms like FullStory are private by default, and won’t collect any data unless you explicitly tell it to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Difference #2: Powered workflows &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Simply put, digital experience intelligence enables teams to move through several data-driven, in-platform workflows—in other words, a sequence of tasks that process a set of data—that most product analytics tools simply don’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Examples of revenue-impacting workflows powered by DXI include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand and visualize user behavior (and actually &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; it through session replay)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measure funnels and conversion rates, and find out why dropoffs occur&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replicate bugs and add context to support tickets with qualitative data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deeply understand adoption and retention of certain features&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While some product analytics tools provide some of these capabilities here and there, each of these is a staple of FullStory’s digital experience intelligence solution. Additionally, product analytics tools often require an integration with another provider in order to see which bugs correlate with revenue opportunities, while DXI provides these insights on its own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Difference #3: Features offered&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because product analytics and digital experience intelligence are each designed with different purposes, the comparison of features is quite the mixed bag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/5-product-management-dashboards&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dashboards&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are essentially the only feature that product analytics and DXI platforms have in common, since both types of solutions are designed to help teams monitor product metrics and KPIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While some product analytics tools offer features like polls and surveys, user feedback forums, in-app pop-ups, and A/B testing, digital experience intelligence needs to integrate with another tool to provide these features—which is made easy by a whole library of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/partners/solutions&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;best-in-class partner integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; available via API. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the other hand, DXI offers session replay, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/2-tips-for-faster-websites-and-online-stores&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;page speed metrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, frustration heuristics (like Rage Clicks), console logging, and developer tools, product analytics solutions need an additional integration to bring these features to life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, the question remains: Do you need product analytics or digital experience intelligence, or both? While the answer still depends on your product team’s specific needs, hopefully you have a better idea of what each solution allows you to see and do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For a closer look at which type of analytics will best suit your organization, download our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/compare-product-analytics-digital-experience-analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Product Analytics vs. Digital Experience Intelligence Comparison Guide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Want to see FullStory in person? &lt;a href=&quot;http://fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Request your demo here.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Best practices for enhancing digital experience with analytics | Qualtrics]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn best practices for using digital analytics to design exceptional customer experiences in this guide.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/best-practices-for-enhancing-digital-experience-with-analytics</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/best-practices-for-enhancing-digital-experience-with-analytics</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The Qualtrics Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Designing your customer experience using digital analytics can greatly enhance how your customers feel about your brand.

No more, no less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But in our current digital landscape, the customer journey encompasses multiple touchpoints and channels, often leaving behind a complex digital footprint that’s difficult to turn into useful insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today understanding a customer’s digital footprint—and what happens at every touchpoint—is crucial. By capturing and consolidating this information, businesses can improve the experiences they offer, identify new opportunities and provide what their digital audiences need for a successful online customer journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And all of this requires digital customer experience analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital customer experience analytics can bring together disparate customer data and transform it into actionable insights. You can use it to understand your customers’ needs and, when set up properly, it can help you predict future behavior, streamline your output, and increase profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It pays to dive deep into your customer’s behavior and requirements; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Marketing%20and%20Sales/Our%20Insights/Five%20facts%20How%20customer%20analytics%20boosts%20corporate%20performance/Datamatics.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;McKinsey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that “intensive” users of customer analytics are 23 times more likely to outperform competitors in customer acquisition, and nine times as likely to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.beaconstac.com/2020/02/qr-codes-loyalty-programs/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;stay loyal customers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Also, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/top-executives-plan-to-spend-more/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;67% of CEOs &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;and other executives believe that customers will become more demanding, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/customer/customer-experience-measurement-metrics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;keeping up with customer experience &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;requirements is more pressing than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But what exactly are digital experience analytics, and how do you measure the data you collect?

Rather than focusing on one area—such as customer effort—these metrics used in conjunction can be strong indicators of good and bad experiences, as well as illustrate factors for retention, satisfaction, and profitability. You can then use your findings to define key performance indicators across from the customer insights you receive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; Choose your methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you’ve decided on your metrics, you can choose the methods you’re going to employ to gather feedback on the digital customer experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer feedback surveys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web analytics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioral data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real-time tracking across websites&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heatmaps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/brand/research-competitors/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Competitor research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every method will give you a different lens into customer behavior. For example, social media analysis (including listening) can help uncover how potential and current customers feel about your brand. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/research/market-research-guide/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Market research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, can give you a comprehensive breakdown of consumer attitudes, expectations, and much more—it all depends on your line of questioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But by using a combination of the above to gather feedback, you can get a more comprehensive and representative view of your brand and the experience you provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Evaluate your data &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As well as collecting data, you need to analyze it. Being able to predict your customers’ next move, rather than just reacting to user behaviors, can transform how you do business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your metrics also need to be assessed. Which data, when overlaid with financial information, best predicts effects on your bottom line? Placing greater focus on improving your results on the metrics that matter most will help you to reap the greatest rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Take your churn rate, for example. If it’s significantly higher than your competitors’, the question is, what are they doing to retain existing customers and attract new ones? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With digital experience analytics—and a focus on the right metrics—you can uncover the what, where, how, and why of your churn rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Being in a position to know what’s causing your customers to churn at specific touchpoints, e.g. high prices or a lack of information, or what your competitors (through research) are doing better, will allow you to implement actionable strategies to reduce churn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dxi-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Find out how to make the most of your data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Take action&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Converting the data and digital experience analytics you collect into a plan for digital transformation is vital for evolving your online customer experience and finding financial benefits.

But why is this the case? Both groups share the same goals: evangelizing product benefits, landing flashy new clients, and growing existing relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The disconnect, however, arises from the different ways the two groups work to achieve these goals. For example, Sales works to win customers one at a time. Marketing works to win customers at scale. As companies grow, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.trello.com/tips-to-improve-cross-team-collaboration&quot;&gt;silo effect takes hold&lt;/a&gt;, and collaboration starts to suffer. It doesn&amp;#x27;t take long for teams to fall out of alignment and for frustrations to mount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sales and marketing: in and out of sync&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When I think about Sales and Marketing alignment at FullStory, it’s clear some things are working well. For instance, we&amp;#x27;re usually on the same page when we go to market with new features. We have a regular “pit crew” meeting where stakeholders from our Sales, Marketing, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/empathy-at-scale-meet-fullstory-huggers/&quot;&gt;Hugging&lt;/a&gt; families join forces to address challenges and explore areas where we can work more in sync. &lt;a href=&quot;https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/&quot;&gt;Objectives and Key Results&lt;/a&gt; (OKRs) help us gain visibility into the projects that other FullStory families currently have on their plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A few months ago, though, we realized some of our existing ways of working together weren’t actually working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For instance, at many companies, Sales relies on Marketing to create new collateral to use throughout the sales process, and FullStory is no different. However, we lacked an efficient process for taking stock of these requests and prioritizing them. A seller might swing by the Marketing area to share an idea or request. Maybe they’d drop a Slack. Or they might even create a card in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-helps-clubhouse-save-time/&quot;&gt;project management platform&lt;/a&gt; asking for a new piece of content to be created. No matter how it surfaced, our lack of process made it hard to get a sense of how important any given request was, assess the type of impact it would have on sales overall, and assess the urgency of one request relative to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We needed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/more-than-human-but-not-machine/&quot;&gt;bionic solution&lt;/a&gt;—one that would scale with the demands of Sales &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reflecting on this problem, I realized that the solution might already exist. It’s called Top 10. Maybe you’ve heard of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to align sales and marketing with Top 10&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is not your average top ten list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Product teams often make lists of features that will help all aspects of the funnel and touch all teams in some way. They are on to something. Given the success of Top 10 on the product side, could sales and marketing adopt it, too? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the beginning of the quarter, gather members of the sales and marketing team, along with account executives (AEs) together to make a top ten list of the most important things to them, individually. Work through collateral ideas and ask questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What purpose does this piece of content have? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would this existing piece of content meet that purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can each team use this piece of content to optimize their role?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which of these ideas will have the greatest business impact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You’ll end up with a huge list of ideas that benefit each team member in some way. Start to pair down the ideas and correlate them with metrics. At the end of the meeting, vote on the ideas as a group, and the top priority will quickly become clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Top 10 process gives you a handy list of the best ideas, vetted and prioritized. Additionally, it created &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;empathy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between all the included teams (a key ingredient in all good relationships!). One of the most important factors of this system is that (at least) four times a year, you have to get all teams together and on the same page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Silos do not exist in success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now teams like sales and marketing can look to the future with confidence their needs will be shared and satisfied. And when teams work together, customers win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How teams can develop product metrics and KPIs ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn about "North Star Metrics," the best tools to gather and understand product metrics, and how to better serve customers with data analysis.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/product-metrics-at-fullstory/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/product-metrics-at-fullstory/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2019 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Product metrics are all about decision-making. They should enable your organization to make better decisions, faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this quick article, we’ll discuss the power of product metrics, how to create a North Star metric, and what product metrics mean for the success of your team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s the deal with product metrics and KPIs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-metrics-matter/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;​​Product metrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are quantifiable data points that a business tracks and analyzes to gauge the success of its product. Examples of product metrics include conversion rate, churn rate, and monthly recurring revenue. These metrics should all tie back to the product strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They are quantifiable data points that an organization tracks and analyzes to measure success, not dissimilar from key performance indicators (KPIs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Product metrics are important, as they are the common thread between different organizations at your company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Product Managers (PMs) are typically the owner of product metrics, but it is meant to be a collaborative process. If everybody owns something, no one owns something. It needs to be cohesive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cross-functional collaboration is a recurring theme with PMs. Whether you&amp;#x27;re focused on data or launching new features, connecting to other people across the business is a critical function of the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What makes a good product metric versus a bad one? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It depends on what you&amp;#x27;re trying to track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/churnrate.asp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Churn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a great product metric. What better way for someone to tell you that they&amp;#x27;re not getting use out of your product than to leave?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But it can also be considered a suboptimal product metric because if you’re looking at churn, it&amp;#x27;s too late. It would be beneficial to know that customers aren&amp;#x27;t completing their use cases well before they actually make the decision to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many teams instead look at the metrics that lead to churn—some of which a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solution or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/DXI-fullstory-google-analytics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can assist with: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sustained feature adoption&lt;/b&gt;: your target audience adopting a feature of your product or app by using it for an extended period of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sessions per user:&lt;/b&gt; a group of user interactions with your product or app recorded in a given time period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bounce rate:&lt;/b&gt; the percentage of visitors on a site or app who leave rather than continuing on within the same site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Active users: &lt;/b&gt;the number of customers who used a product or app within a certain period of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do product metrics change throughout growth?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Product metrics definitely can and should change as the company grows. It all goes back to the customer and how your product is evolving to meet their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a product evolves, it’s time to decide which metrics are the most important. For instance, maybe daily &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/graph-monthly-weekly-and-daily-active-user-trends-by-behavior-user-attribute/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;active users&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are no longer as attractive as monthly active users. Adjust, evaluate and decide. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do you keep metrics fresh?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many teams pursue customer interactions as a way of keeping metrics fresh. It’s important to be in tune with what customers are doing and what the most important features are to them, along with the core problems that they&amp;#x27;re facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There&amp;#x27;s a lot of different metrics out there. There&amp;#x27;s probably a lot of different use cases, find the metric that is the one you hold above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To keep an eye on customer interactions, use a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/what-is-session-replay-useful-for/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where you can view user events—such as clicks, scrolling, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828013-Frustrated-Sessions&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;frustrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—into a reproduction of what the user did on the site or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do you create a North Star product metric?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Making sure that you have the data needed to analyze is a good start to creating a North Star metric. String all these analyses together, and it creates the most important metric of all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It all goes back to the customer, to understand who you&amp;#x27;re trying to serve and what you need to know to best serve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does this product work best for the customer? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the questions that your customers care about? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can these questions be answered with data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Your &lt;a href=&quot;https://mixpanel.com/blog/north-star-metric&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;North Star metric&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; should be something you keep your eye on daily. As opposed to being reactionary every time you hear something is going on, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/optimize-user-login-flow-with-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;monitor your product usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and respond appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Being data-driven with metrics is critical when aligning product marketing, engineering, or customer support teams around a North Star metric. Being able to back up why you&amp;#x27;re choosing a metric is extremely important when it comes to convincing everyone you need it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What are the challenges in creating product metrics? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Aligning cross-functional teams on metrics is tough, but necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You&amp;#x27;re not going to get alignment unless you prove that you&amp;#x27;re willing to listen to everyone who has something to say about it. Listening to people from different perspectives is super important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/session-replay-elevates-qualitative-analytics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is helpful, and it can help build conviction in yourself before you want to present an idea out there that you know is probably going to get poked and prodded from every single way. But listening to people, building that trust, and showing them your thought process for building up to a North Star metric is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When in doubt, go back to the data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-intelligence/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the core foundation for building product metrics that matter—and that move the needle for your team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

We saw huge real-world improvements to both long-tail latency, as well as overall system stability. So when we heard that Google was beta testing new VM instances based on third-generation AMD EPYC™ Milan, we were understandably excited to get our hands on them to try them out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By participating in the N2D-Milan beta, we were able to run a suite of database benchmarks using an open source solr specific benchmarking framework we built called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/solr-bench&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Solr Bench&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Read on to learn more about our testing methodology and how you can try things out for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Test Setup and Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our core Search and analytics infrastructure is based upon the hugely popular open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Apache Lucene and Solr projects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We developed and open sourced a benchmarking framework (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/solr-bench&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Solr Bench&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to make it super easy (and repeatable) to spin up a multi-node Solr cluster, index a custom dataset, and run custom queries against it—all while controlling for VM JIT warmup, different instance sizes and OS images, JDK versions, GC algorithms and tracking CPU, query time, RAM usage and other metrics. The suite produces a simple report at the end with the benchmark results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Setup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While our harness is capable of setting up a multi-node Solr cluster, we decided to keep things simple this time and compare single nodes. Each node was configured as an N2D-Standard-4 (16 CPUs, 32GB Ram) VM with network attached PD SSDs. We tested a slightly modified fork of Solr 8, running on OpenJDK 11.0.10 on Debian 10 with the JVM heap sizes set to 24GB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;N2D-Rome instances were standard N2D instances, while the N2D-Milan instances were established by setting the minCPUPlatform as “AMD Milan” within the terraform GCP config (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/solr-bench/blob/master/stress-facets-milan.json#L91&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;this example configuration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We ran two separate tests: one using some internal custom datasets and proprietary query workloads, and a second using an openly available dataset from Kaggle with some generated filter, facet and join queries (that we are releasing as open source so you can try them out for yourself). Both tests used a single collection with a single shard and replica and included some queries reserved for JIT warmup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over the course of a day, there was some variance in the performance of the N2D-Rome instances across runs—sometimes by as much as 5%. The N2D-Milan instances, however, showed very consistent results on every run. While we aren’t certain, we believe this is due to their being in limited Beta preview and not subject to noisy neighbor vCPU issues like N2D-Rome. With those qualifiers out of the way, the trends were consistent: &lt;i&gt;N2D-Milan consistently outperformed N2D-Rome&lt;/i&gt;. Sometimes by quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Internal Workload Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our internal dataset test had ~6 million synthetic documents, with several dozen fields per document. The queries were generated from an internal tool simulating a range of loads designed to stress test the database. This test used a slightly modified version of Solr with proprietary indexing and query code relevant to FullStory analytics (deployed via Solr Plugin). This made heavy use of multi-document joins, nested facets, and other CPU intensive query patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Compared to N2D-Rome instances, N2D-Milan instances were 28.9% faster on average for Query latency, with a median latency improvement of 19.9%. We also observed Indexing speedups (not shown on the chart) of ~10.6% on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Open Workload Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Posting benchmarks of proprietary, non-open source workloads isn’t nearly as satisfying as publishing results you can try to replicate yourself. So, we created some more benchmark configurations using a publicly available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;kaggle dataset&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; consisting of ecommerce user behaviour events and standard, non-proprietary Solr/Lucene queries. We created two different query workloads. One focusing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/solr-bench/blob/master/stress-facets.json&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;filtering and facets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and another &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/solr-bench/blob/master/stress-joins.json&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;focusing on joins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We generated queries at different time offsets to avoid internal caching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here, we see more modest performance improvements, with p95 latencies improving by about 16.7% and average latency improving by about 14.6%. Indexing performance (not shown on the chart) showed about a 4.6% improvement on average. It is worth noting that this data set is very simple, having only nine basic columns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our join query results showed a larger performance delta than the facet queries, with p95 latencies improving by about 28.3% and average latency improving by about 22.6%. The join queries are individually far more compute intensive than the individual facet queries. It is interesting to observe more performance gains for the more expensive workloads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each benchmark result is going to be highly workload dependent, and our tests reflect that. We saw larger speedups with heavier query workloads, and saw the largest speedups in our own proprietary workloads. What this tells us is that for the same instance type—&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;at the same price point&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;—we could see ~29% query performance gains on average, with potentially larger gains for our p95 and p99 queries. These are really impressive generational gains, and we expect this to translate to dramatically improved utilization and better experiences for our customers. We can’t wait to get these instances deployed across our infrastructure in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And If you’re interested in replicating some of the results in this blog post yourself, feel free to try out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/solr-bench&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Solr Bench&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[When great culture meets great code: How FullStory’s team accelerates the Flywheel ]]></title><description><![CDATA[At SaaStr Annual, FullStory’s Founder and CEO shared the 3-part formula for building a high-growth SaaS company.

And while the process is full of intricacies, there’s a simple equation to guide you through it.  At this year’s SaaStr Annual event in San Mateo, FullStory Founder and CEO Scott Voigt shared his three-part formula for building a successful SaaS startup from the ground up. Here’s a summary of his presentation and his lessons learned along the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What you need to know to build a SaaS rocketship&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The magic formula: (i)*(g)*(c) = 🚀 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Building a successful SaaS company may not &lt;i&gt;technically &lt;/i&gt;be rocket science, but it is a complex undertaking. To make this complicated task easier to digest, Scott developed a simple framework to go by: (i)*(g)*(c)* = 🚀. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While this might look like a bit of gibberish, it’s actually a simple equation that expresses the three key ingredients of a high-growth SaaS business. Written out, it would be: &lt;b&gt;Idea&lt;/b&gt; x &lt;b&gt;Go-to-Market&lt;/b&gt; x &lt;b&gt;Culture&lt;/b&gt; = &lt;b&gt;SaaS rocketship&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory’s founding team—comprised of eight former googlers—believe that when each of these elements are thoughtfully strategized and multiplied with one another, you’ll have a successful SaaS organization. Here’s how FullStory approaches each piece of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Invention&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ironically, when FullStory was founded, it wasn’t FullStory at all. The team behind the company was pursuing another software idea entirely—a sort of combo marketing and project management solution called Homebase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When they went to meet with a potential investor, he asked a question that changed the company’s course: “What’s the invention?” Scott and the team realized that they had an &lt;i&gt;idea &lt;/i&gt;but not an &lt;i&gt;invention. &lt;/i&gt;While Homebase might solve a problem, it didn’t solve it in an innovative way that would be uniquely valuable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So they reevaluated their premise, asking themselves, “What are we good at?” And a simple answer came back:” We understand the web.” While working on Homebase, they realized that the event instrumentation paradigm that had defined digital experience analytics was no longer enough; they set out to build something that could take in all of a website’s visitor data, index it, and distribute it to cross-departmental teams in meaningful ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This kind of digital experience intelligence software would solve a problem that people didn’t know could be solved—a sure sign of an innovative product. And FullStory as we know it was born. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go-to-market &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Armed with a good idea, the early FullStory team needed a business plan. FullStory has always thought of our go-to-market (GTM) motion as what we call “the Flywheel,” which is roughly equivalent to the concept of product-led growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the early days of FullStory, our founding team determined that starting at a relatively low price point would force us to be excellent product builders and encourage us to think about the product at scale rather than relying entirely on outbound sales, creating a sustainable growth model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As shown in this graph, the number of potential customers goes down as a product’s price goes up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The idea behind the flywheel is that by starting small, we can earn loyal users who will take FullStory with them as they move on to different—often larger—companies. The software also matures and is able to start with a foundation that grows in capability to support larger customers along the way. Then, as our customers grow in their careers and their companies grow too, FullStory grows alongside them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Culture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory’s outset, culture wasn’t a major concern. The company was founded by a group of people who already knew one another, had a shared mindset, and placed priorities in similar orders. These commonalities  meant they didn’t really &lt;i&gt;need &lt;/i&gt;to proactively think about culture in those early days—it occurred naturally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As the company grew, though, they set out to define the cultural values that would be woven into the fabric of FullStory. Two of the key values they came up with were &lt;b&gt;empathy&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;clarity&lt;/b&gt;. Here’s how these values play out day to day: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Everything about FullStory is built on empathy: We aim to lead with empathy within the company and toward our customers, and the product allows &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; customers to empathize with &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; customers. Empathy is baked into FullStory on a foundational level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Clarity describes how we communicate. We approach clarity with the belief that no problem or disagreement should survive a thorough, clear description of it. When we encounter some issue, we talk or write it out until a logical solution appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This comes into play when decisions are made that impact the whole company. When FullStory was a tiny organization, everyone in the room could weigh in on a decision and be happy with the outcome. As the company gets bigger, it’s inevitable that someone somewhere will be unhappy about almost any decision that’s made. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When we communicate with clarity, we can transparently explain the factors and reasoning behind decisions that impact our teams. Whether happy or unhappy with the outcome, clarity allows each FullStorian to assume that big decisions were made with good intent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;🚀&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each of these concepts alone don’t amount to a whole lot. But when you combine an idea that makes peoples’ lives easier, a go-to-market strategy that’s sustainable, and a culture built on empathy and clarity, you’ve got the best chances of launching a rocketship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Striking a balance between product management and customer advocacy]]></title><description><![CDATA[Advocating for your customers' needs has its limits.

And product managers are often in the trenches improving the product, which can have nothing to do with the customer problems at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://userguiding.com/blog/customer-advocacy/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Customer advocacy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can be downright difficult and frustrating. But there are ways to make it better.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Great customer advocacy starts with shared understanding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Making sure customers are heard through internal advocates starts with fostering a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/building-a-customer-support-culture-for-management-and-growth/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer support culture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where there’s shared understanding and respect across teams. When it comes to doing the customer’s voice justice — acknowledge their issue and fold it into the outstanding backlogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Shared understanding results in support professionals becoming better advocates for the customers they’re trying to help. The marriage between support and product managers — and to their counterpoints in engineering — makes customer advocacy possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Celebrating customer happiness and keeping positive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customer-story/saas/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; visible is a good way to keep customer experience visible in any company. A great way to do this is to collaborate and connect with your team about customer success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get (and stay) on your customer’s level&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can’t solve every customer problem, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-to-convince-your-product-manager-that-a-bug-needs-to-get-fixed/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;fix all the bugs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and customize the product to exact customer specifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When customers have bug problems that won’t be fixed or feature suggestions that may never be implemented, ghosting them by failing to address their issue — not replying — leaves your customer in the dark. When cases come along where the ideal solution isn’t feasible, it’s best to communicate plainly, even if it’s bad news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While what you’re telling a customer may not be what they’d ideally like to hear, it should at least be straightforward . As a customer, getting an answer back receiving the request and that it is being worked on is far better than no response at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sometimes simply being heard is what’s most important.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/373674&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Transparent responses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; help maintain good standing with customers while tempering their sway on product development. As a customer, how would these responses make you feel? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thank you for your feedback, it makes us better at our job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got your request, John, we’re on the case!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we don’t know the timeframe just yet, rest assured we are working on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Listening isn’t just reading complaints.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A key part of understanding how and when to advocate for customers is harvesting feedback for how they really feel — both the customers who reach out with problems and the ones who don’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You don’t want to be swayed by a vocally unhappy 5% of customers if 95% of your customers are in love with your product. But, you also don’t want to ignore negative comments if they’re a good indicator of overall customer happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Being proactive is a great customer advocacy tactic. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reach out to customers to ‘take their temperature’, so to speak. A default, low-touch solution can be as simple as asking how their experience is after they reach out to support. With each support ticket, send out a request about how their experience was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Statistically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/blog/what-is-a-good-survey-response-rate&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;5%-30%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of customers actually take the time to reply —and if on the higher side demonstrates an impressive level of investment in the interaction. But with just a response, you don’t know much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replays&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—as with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solution such as FullStory—can also be a good way to understand whether it’s just a single user having an issue or a larger, multi-user problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, reviewing customer sessions can reveal a design issue that’s causing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rage clicks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — indicative of an issue that will affect many more users than those who take the time to contact support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer advocacy is about finding a balance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Balancing a commitment to customers and customer advocacy can be difficult when you’re trying to build a product and run a company. It’s important for customer advocates to feel like they can represent your users well, but they also need to be judicious about what to bring forward and push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By creating a culture where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/3-ways-product-teams-can-cultivate-user-empathy/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;empathy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for customers is embraced in a balanced way across your organization through customer advocacy can make for a level foundation upon which a great customer experience can be built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How two Canadian retailers powered growth with DXI]]></title><description><![CDATA[Digital experience isn’t a local phenomenon.

Aside from an uptick in shipping, shopping with a company based down the street is functionally identical to shopping with one on the other side of the globe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Or, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2017/07/globalization-in-the-age-of-trump&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; explained: “Business leaders are scrambling to adjust to a world few imagined possible just a year ago. The myth of a borderless world has come crashing down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Accordingly, emphasis on digital experience shouldn’t be a phenomenon specific to one country or part of the world. In Canada, a booming ecommerce sector indicates the need for refocusing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/canada-ecommerce&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;The International Trade Administration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there were over 27 million Canadian ecommerce users in 2021, accounting for 72.5% of the Canadian population. That’s expected to grow to 77.6% by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/45-28-0001/2020001/article/00064-eng.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Statistics Canada&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ecommerce sales more than doubled in 2020—with a 110.8% increase compared to the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence is revolutionizing the global landscape of online retail.

Today, the company owns and operates one of the most respected luxury fashion brands in the United States (Saks Fifth Avenue) as well as the most beloved department store in Canada (Hudson’s Bay). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before using FullStory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Prior to FullStory, Hudson’s Bay Company struggled to identify actionable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-intelligence-features-for-complete-dx-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital experience insights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; efficiently. Technical complexities and over-burdened data teams made it difficult for product owners to quickly spot and address shopper frustrations and opportunities for improvement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After onboarding FullStory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With FullStory, product owners at HBC can diagnose and prioritize issues based on real-time shopper interactions with the digital experience. For example, the team used FullStory’s DXI solution to better understand the customer journey, touchpoints, and friction on their current website. They used this data to identify opportunities and build a website that will be tailored to customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Their results:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 Saks+ pilot program validated with FullStory insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;18 bugs identified and fixed in 3 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 site migrations kicked off using FullStory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customer-story/ecommerce-retail/hbc-saks/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read HBC’s story here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What retailers can learn&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Getting a thorough understanding of how shoppers filter and navigate through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is critical to improving user experience.

They believed that this high rate was linked to issues with the proprietary login system used by Shoppers’ parent company, but were unable to offer evidence that this was the cause of customer confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After onboarding FullStory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By using FullStory’s Digital Experience Intelligence solution, the digital team was able to use hundreds of session replays to validate their theory to leadership, and then used FullStory data to design a new login system that has reduced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/3-ways-to-boost-conversions/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;funnel dropout&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rate by 45%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Their results:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;45% reduction in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/funnel-analysis-for-digital-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;registration funnel drop-off&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1+ week reduction in time to resolve support tickets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 digital Shoppers teams using FullStory cross-functionally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Shoppers’ digital team, now it often takes less than five minutes to nail down bugs that would otherwise be totally unidentifiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customer-story/ecommerce-retail/shoppers-drug-mart/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read Shoppers Drug Mart’s story here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What retailers can learn&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045159373-About-Funnels-?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=learn.fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Useful, scalable conversion funnels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are the backbone of a world-class ecommerce user experience.

And, mobile phones generate 52% of the total internet traffic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mobile is the place everyone goes countless times every day—because you need to know, you need to solve, you need to shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Smartphones connect you to your community, to the news and events you’re interested in, to the brands you care about, and to the world. That connection is expansive, intimate and isolating. According to Pew Research Center, almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/25/americans-going-online-almost-constantly/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;31% of mobile internet users in the U.S. report being online “almost constantly.”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If mobile tech feels like an extension of the self, it follows that people are very selective about the brands and apps they allow into that space. People fill that space with things that are relevant and resonant to them, that make their lives easier and add value to their day-to-day lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For brands, squeezing into that valuable space is increasingly tricky.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do you become a part of your customer’s mobile ecosystem? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Becoming a part of a customer’s life by way of their mobile device starts with fostering a shared mindset that considers the full customer journey and prioritizes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/empathy-customer-journey-maps/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer empathy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at every touchpoint. Then moving from mindset to action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Remember that while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customer-story/ecommerce-retail/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ecommerce teams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might be focused on mobile, your customers and users are simply experiencing another interaction with your brand. They expect it to help them, not impede their omnichannel journey—which is sometimes the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example: a local grocery store offers $100 in free groceries for first-time customers. To redeem it, you download their app. However, upon visiting the app and hitting a brick wall with registration multiple times, that $100 credit was nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Moments before, that person was ready to become a customer, and now they are most likely deleting your app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;An infuriating mobile experience can not only cost you a download and a future customer, but it can also leave a bitter taste in your customer’s mouth for the future. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This company lost sight of the fact that a bad mobile experience—like a bad apple—can ruin everything. The good news? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offers a way to circumvent this situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To really optimize your mobile experience design, rely on one of the tried-est and truest tools in any product owner’s toolbelt: the customer journey map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Map your mobile customer journey&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer journey maps answer questions like who the customer is, what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;jobs they get done&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with your product, what pain points they experience, and how exactly they use your product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Exhaustively answering these questions (and others) can go a long way to helping marketing, sales, product development, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/engineers-guide-dxi/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;engineering&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and support teams identify the path of a customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you’re building your first map or iterating on an existing version, consider both the customer journey (how customers experience your brand) and the customer management journey (how your organization operationalizes customer interactions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To create a proper journey map, you’ll need to gather both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;quantitative and qualitative customer research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and you’ll need input from customer-facing stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At a high level, building a customer journey map should include the following five steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Define data-driven target personas. &lt;/b&gt;Just like the busy mom, define your target groups and what evidence you have to back up that choice. What jobs are they trying to get done at a high level?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Define your customers’ behavior stages.&lt;/b&gt; There are many customer behavior heuristic models for this, but it should follow some variation of Discover &amp;gt; Research &amp;gt; Choose &amp;gt; Purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Align customer goals with each stage.&lt;/b&gt; What do customers want to achieve as they move through each behavioral stage? Try to take a walk in your customer’s shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plot the touchpoints.&lt;/b&gt; How do customers engage with your brand? This step can be difficult if you don’t have a central database that combines information across your digital and offline touchpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conceptualize your map.&lt;/b&gt; A spreadsheet will do in a pinch. The ultimate goal should be a visualization that can be shared and operationalized across your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mobile customers need empathy too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a product owner, you should adopt an empathic lens at all times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/3-ways-product-teams-can-cultivate-user-empathy/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Customer empathy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is particularly important when you’re building and optimizing your mobile experience. The mobile context presents unique challenges to providing customers with certainty, clarity, and assurance—all things people crave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This context makes it critical to make choices that foster certainty when it comes to mobile—which, again and again, requires a commitment to empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Empathy is one of those buzzwords that sound really good, but very few companies actually understand what it means, much less practice it. According to PwC, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/future-of-customer-experience.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;38% of U.S. consumers say the employees they interact with understand their needs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://davidrock.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. David Rock&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neuroleadership.com/about-us/background/our-story&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;NeuroLeadership Institute&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and author of the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Your-Brain-Work-Strategies-Distraction/dp/0061771295&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Your Brain at Work&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in the face of uncertainty, our brains must “use dramatically more resources, involving the more energy-intensive prefrontal cortex, to process moment-to-moment experience.” When your shoppers feel uncertain, they slow down, hesitate, disengage, and abandon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cognitive strain is already heightened when people are in a mobile context. They are likely doing multiple other things—navigating on a smaller screen, without a mouse or a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep these questions in mind when it comes to customer needs: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are our shoppers trying to do? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are their mobile experience objectives? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is important to them? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What resonates with them? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can’t answer these questions without connecting to and conversing with customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your mobile and product design teams should spend time interviewing customers, reading customer messages, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-intelligence/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;observing customers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as they try to navigate your website or mobile app. This exposure will help your team understand what customers want and need from your mobile experience, as well as their current pains and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/list-your-top-rage-clicks-and-dead-clicks/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;frustrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Full stream ahead: Staying atop the mobile experience curve&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The current and future state of mobile is a state of permanent connectedness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This means endless opportunities to reach your target audience and earn a coveted spot in their mobile ecosystem. It also means the people you’re trying to reach will be constantly bombarded by companies vying for their attention. Expectations driven up, tolerance for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/finding-dxi-signals-through-the-noise/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;friction-filled experiences&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; driven down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Entirely new, formerly impossible ways to reach customers will become reality. Sophisticated technologies will go mobile and our devices will become even more connected, communicating back and forth and generating more specific data about preferences and habits. Apps that we haven’t yet imagined will come into being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;History will repeat itself: marketers, product managers, and designers will scramble to capitalize on the next big thing, often at the expense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/trends-digital-customer-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The companies that succeed will continue to prioritize customer needs over the &amp;quot;next big thing.&amp;quot; Of course, customer-centricity should not come at the expense of innovation, technological or otherwise. Rather, use customer empathy as a North Star, guiding you to determine which optimizations, additions, and innovations to pursue that provide a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/dxi-for-mobile-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;mobile experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that is valuable, respectful, and self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

Google Trends shows search interest for “&lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;amp;q=customer%20experience&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” has grown 12% each year for the last 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;CX has slight variance in definition from company to company:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Customer experience is the impression your customers have of your brand as a whole throughout all aspects of the buyer&amp;#x27;s journey. It results in their view of your brand and impacts factors related to your bottom line including revenue.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/service/what-is-customer-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;HubSpot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Customer experience is defined as your customers’ perceptions — both conscious and subconscious — of their relationship with your brand resulting from all their interactions during the customer life cycle.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/marketing/customer-experience-management.html#&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;SAS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Customer experience (CX) is everything related to a business that affects a customer’s perception and feelings about it.” (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zendesk.com/blog/why-companies-should-invest-in-the-customer-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zendesk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Emphasizing CX makes for a happy customer, and a happy customer means repeat business and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecloudtutorial.com/customer-lifetime-value/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;lifetime value&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After all, an unhappy customer won’t stick around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer experience is authentic and authoritative&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But why the rise in focus on customer experience? A closer look at what makes CX important is helpful in answering that question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;CX happens at the level of the individual. It is how a specific person perceives your business, brand, product, marketing—everything. A customer’s experience is unique and personal, original and non-derivative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The uniqueness of a customer’s experience makes it authentic.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every aspect of the product or service is experienced in a unique way through the lens of the customer. You give the same product, service, marketing, or advertising campaign  to two different people and you will get two different experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Those experiences are indisputable and genuine, even if they weren’t what was intended by the provider of the service.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The authenticity of a customer’s experience makes it authoritative.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
The authority of a customer’s experience is derived from it being indisputable. How do you debate how a customer experienced your product or service? You really can’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Together, customer experience drives an authentic, authoritative opinion about your business. The mantra of “the customer is always right” is downright hard to dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;WOM versus going viral &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer experience is a frame for understanding what drives that time-tested, age-old source of marketing — word-of-mouth (WOM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In our digital age, it’s never been easier for WOM to spread, although now it’s considered “going viral.” Smartphones and social media combine to give word-of-mouth a default one-to-many modality. Today, the private, personal customer experience is made public with just a couple of clicks and swipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://review42.com/resources/word-of-mouth-marketing-statistics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;word-of-mouth stats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that might wow you: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;86% of customers trust word-of-mouth reviews and recommendations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;92% of consumers trust recommendations from friends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;WOM brings in 5x more sales than paid media&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word of mouth drives $6 trillion of annual consumer spending&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Your customer experience is in the hands of many, digitally speaking. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition to the scale of digital, modern word-of-mouth can bias towards &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.revechat.com/blog/bad-customer-service/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;exaggerating customer experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — you get either unbridled enthusiasm or shaming outrage. When was the last time you posted to Instagram or Facebook about a lukewarm customer experience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get ahead of customer experiences with digital intelligence. Instead of waiting to hear what each customer feels about your product, experience it with them. FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solution allows you to stay ahead of WOM (good or bad). Understand user’s on-page signals, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624154-Rage-Clicks-Error-Clicks-Dead-Clicks-and-Thrashed-Cursor-Frustration-Signals&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;frustrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and problems to capture those experiences before they go “viral”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the receiving side, customers are both actively seeking out information about brands, products, and services, or passively consuming that information across whatever channels with which they are engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Great customer experience, incredible WOM&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s our simple perspective. Competition for products and services leads to businesses building better ways to get jobs done. This isn&amp;#x27;t new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s changed is how the megaphone of digital is amplifying customer experience through word-of-mouth — ensuring that the best products will win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory created a way to visualize customer interactions in a way that was clarifying and intuitive, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it solved that problem. And once we saw it in action, we believed other companies would benefit from having it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Managing customer experience is not a solved problem. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It enables every team — engineering, design, product marketing, customer support, everyone — to catch the errors, find and pave the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/desire-paths-digital-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;desire paths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, build better customer journeys, and give customer support professionals superpowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For further reading, check out: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/cx-and-web-performance/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;3 ways web performance is critical for digital customer experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-solutions-partner-program/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Be your clients&amp;#x27; go-to source for customer experience solutions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/nps-digital-customer-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;How to improve digital customer experience with NPS surveys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/trends-digital-customer-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;12 trends for better digital customer experience in 2021&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By building up your customer experience knowledge, you can gain digital insights on future trends.

Over the course of that first year, 5 new articles were published. As might be expected with low output, our blog received low traffic. Our recruiting team was interested in directing candidates to the blog, but feared that stale content would send a negative signal. Recognizing that a cadence of 5 articles per year didn’t relay the energy and enthusiasm inherent to our engineering group, our CTO decided that someone should lead the charge to reinvigorate our blog in 2020 and raise the profile of our engineering staff and the fantastic/fascinating work that we do. I saw an opportunity to build on my people skills (persuasion) and strategy skills (defining a mission and setting related goals) so I raised my hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By the end of the year, our engineering team published 26 articles, maintaining a cadence of one article every other week. Readership increased 730% year over year. Our content ended up in widely-distributed software development e-newsletters and top-5 Google search results. Links to our blog go out to all candidates during our recruiting team’s initial outreach, and candidates have mentioned our blog content as a positive influence when researching FullStory as a place to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So how did I convince 21 engineers to author 26 articles in exactly one year?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make it worth their time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What do great engineers want?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Is it maximum compensation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Or unlimited paid time off?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How about foosball, free meals, and an endless supply of snacks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I believe great engineers want to work with other great engineers, because great engineers learn from each other and produce the best products together. An active engineering blog is a signal to great engineers that other great engineers work at FullStory. I reached out to our recruiting team and they agreed. They were thrilled to be armed with strong evidence of a high-functioning and active engineering corps. They announced that they would use the newly invigorated Bionic blog in all of their sourcing and outreach emails. The relationships between our recruiting and engineering staff are strong at FullStory, so having the recruiters pitch the value of the blog was a great testimonial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The value of authoring articles for the blog was clear: you can help bring in talented people who can help you build a great product, and who you can learn from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Frame an ambitious goal so that it is attainable&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Targeting 26 new articles for the year seemed unreasonable. Engineers are busy! How can we expect to 5x our blog content from the prior year at the same time that product work continues to grow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Framing the goal relative to overall team size provided the right perspective. The engineering team was large enough that if less than half the team wrote one article, we’d hit the target. Framed a slightly different way: if every engineer wrote one article, we’d have multiple years worth of content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the realization that 26 articles per year was attainable simply by virtue of our team size, what once seemed an unlikely goal was now viewed as entirely feasible. A barrier to action had been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publicize, Praise, Prod&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are a few large group meetings on the quarterly calendar at FullStory: a product all-hands meeting, an engineering all-hands meeting, and a weekly company all-hands meeting. I worked with the organizers of these meetings to ensure that time was allotted to review engineering blog status (I spoke at the company all-hands once or twice per quarter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The message was simple:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;relay progress towards the 26-article goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;report on blog traffic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;praise authors for their contributions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;solicit more authors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I set up a Slack channel dedicated to information about the blog and asked our Bionic Ops team (an internal development team) to add all engineers to the channel as part of the new hire onboarding process. I pinned a short document outlining blog themes and some helpful tips for authoring content to the channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For every new article, I posted a message announcing the article and praising the authors (along with a running tally of the total number of articles published thus far). Other engineers would share in the praise. The channel was also a forum for potential authors to share article ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Publicly praising authors in company meetings and public Slack channels helped elevate the status of the blog and the authors who contributed to it. At the same time, I kept a running list of potential authors (folks who shared ideas in the public channel) that I would reach out to periodically via direct message. I called this list my “Blog Nag” list — it was my reference for who I should be reaching out to and all of the times I had reached out to them. The trick was finding a balance between “Patrick, you’re annoying” and “thanks for reminding me.” It would sometimes take weeks of private reminders to shepherd an article onto the blog, but persistence almost always paid off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A life of its own&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the beginning of 2021, I needed to hand off blog shepherding duties so that I could take on other initiatives. I made one final appearance at the company all-hands where I did a roll-call of the 21 authors who wrote for the blog and trumpeted the astounding growth in traffic that their content created. I closed by asking for volunteers to take over Bionic and quickly received a hand-raiser. Another engineer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanacarroll/&quot;&gt;Jordan Carroll&lt;/a&gt;, has taken the mantle and great content continues to roll out onto the blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our engineering blog has now become an institution. Momentum has built such that there is a queue of articles and authors deep enough to maintain several months-worth of content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;None of this would have been possible if not for our curious and talented engineering staff. They take the initiative to build creative solutions to our most complex problems and graciously share their insights with the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s more to come!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to monitor and optimize your website for Google’s 2021 Page Experience update]]></title><description><![CDATA[Understanding and preparing your website for the Google 2021 Page Experience update]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/google-page-experience-update-2021</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/google-page-experience-update-2021</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Madison Eubanks]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article summary: &lt;/b&gt;In May of 2021, Google is rolling out a new Page Experience signal, a combination of several site performance metrics that will affect where websites rank in search. Here, we break down what the update will look like, and how you can understand and improve your page’s experience using both free tools from Google and related insights from FullStory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every day, over 3.5 billion searches &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;are conducted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Google. After a little number-crunching, that breaks down to a whopping 40,000 searches &lt;i&gt;per second. &lt;/i&gt;And of the people conducting these billions of searches, 75 percent will never get beyond the first page of results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These stats offer proof of what you already know: ranking well on Google search can make or break online businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For years, companies have been investing time and resources into SEO, creating pages and content designed to rank well–and therefore be easily found–in Google’s search results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Starting in May of 2021, a page’s SEO on Google will expand to include a new set of criteria. Google is introducing the Page Experience signal, a new ranking factor that uses multiple subsignals to determine a page’s overall experience and rank it accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The significance of providing a great digital experience is not new. Last year, Salesforce reported that one in three customers will walk from a brand after just one bad experience, &lt;i&gt;forever. &lt;/i&gt;At FullStory, our mission is to help online organizations create digital experience that not only function properly, but that actually make online interactions delightful for users by proactively identifying friction-causing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the past, online businesses have only needed to focus on the experience users have once they actually arrive on the website. Now, with the new Page Experience signal, a poor digital experience can negatively affect your site before visitors even land on it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, what does the new Page Experience signal mean? &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To put it simply, the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Page Experience signal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will determine how good or bad a site’s user experience is, and that will factor into where it ranks in search results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some of the subsignals that factor into the new Page Experience signal  are already measured by Google, while others will be totally new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Existing subsignals, which will now be rolled up into the larger Page Experience signal, include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mobile friendly:&lt;/b&gt; A measure of how well a web page translates to mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Safe-browsing:&lt;/b&gt; A page doesn’t contain any malicious or deceptive content, such as malware or social engineering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HTTPS:&lt;/b&gt; Whether or not a page is served over HTTPS, an encrypted network protocol and secure alternative to HTTP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;No intrusive interstitials:&lt;/b&gt; Interstitials can be disruptive and make a page’s content difficult to access, creating a poor user experience. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2016/08/helping-users-easily-access-content-on&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Here are examples of intrusive and non-intrusive interstitials.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;new&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; components of the Page Experience signal that will roll out in May are the &lt;b&gt;Core Web Vitals. &lt;/b&gt;Google’s Core Web Vitals are user-centric, measurable signals for which Google provides a “standard” target threshold. These user-centric signals include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)&lt;/b&gt;: This is essentially a measure of a page’s loading time. By Google’s standard, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when a page first starts to load, and a poor LCP is anything over 4 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What does it mean? The Largest Contentful Paint measures how long it takes for the largest visible image or text block to appear. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Input Delay (FID)&lt;/b&gt;: This measures how long a page takes to become interactive. A good FID is less 100 milliseconds, while a poor FID is anything above 300 milliseconds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What does it mean? FID is the amount of time between a user’s first interaction with a page (by clicking a link, using a button, etc.) and the browser actually becoming responsive and able to process that interaction. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): &lt;/b&gt;This is a measure of a web page’s visual stability. Sites should strive for a CLS score of less than 0.1, and a poor score is considered anything over .25. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What does it mean? Cumulative Layout Shift scores help quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts when using a web page. (Think: times you’ve gone to click/tap some element on a page and it moved suddenly, causing you to click something unintended.) &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What can you do to be ready for the Page Experience signal? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since this update comes from Google and affects your Google search rank (SERPs), it should be no surprise that the best tools for measuring your site’s Page Experience also sit within Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can measure and track your site’s Core Web Vitals with tools you are likely already using. Google’s Search Console has a new Core Web Vitals report that will offer a snapshot of how your site is currently performing and identify pages that can be improved. After you’ve identified which pages are falling short, you can use PageSpeed Insights to zero in on what specifically needs to be fixed. While these tools won’t give you an outright Page Experience score, they will create actionable insights into how your page stacks up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can FullStory insights help you create great a digital experience that meets Google’s criteria?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Currently, FullStory won’t measure or assign a “Page Experience Score” for your site. The weight of each signal factoring into Google’s Page Experience signal is, of course, confidential. Plus, Google notes that they intend to change and optimize the Page Experience signal &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/page-experience#signals&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;every year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are several key FullStory &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828873-Page-Speed-Metrics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Page Speed Metrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; metrics that run parallel to the new signal: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Contentful Paint (FCP): &lt;/b&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828873-Page-Speed-Metrics#fmp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;First Contentful Paint&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; event relates to when the first element from the DOM appears in a users’ browser. This is different from LCP, which measures when the &lt;i&gt;largest&lt;/i&gt; element appears, rather than the first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOMContentLoaded (DCL): &lt;/b&gt;On a basic level, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828873-Page-Speed-Metrics#domcontentloaded-dcl&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DCL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives you an idea of how long it takes for a page’s HTML to load so that it can start rendering content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Page Load:&lt;/b&gt; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828873-Page-Speed-Metrics#page-load&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Page Load&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; signal fires when the whole page and all of its dependent resources have finished loading and become interactive for a user. This metric can help you understand how long it takes for your page to become fully usable, and can act as a very rough proxy for the First Input Delay (FID) subsignal mentioned above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While these signals don’t map precisely back to the Google Page Experience signal, they go a long way toward giving you an idea of how users are experiencing content on your website. When taken together, these FullStory metrics can provide insight into how long a customer has to wait before they can interact with your website and its content, whether longer load times are causing friction in the user experience, and how these factor into the overall experience that Google is measuring with the Page Experience signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are dozens of variables that contribute to a site’s SEO rank, which have led to countless tips, tricks, and best practices that marketers use to improve sites’ and content’s SEO performance. And while following some of those best practices will move the needle in the right direction, the bottom line remains: &lt;b&gt;the best, most relevant content or site will win, because Google wants to provide users with the best experience possible. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And, ultimately, the same rule of thumb will apply for the Page Experience signal. Yes, it’s important to monitor the metrics that Google measures and ensure that your site performs well. But at the end of the day, the site with the best overall experience will come out on top. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The significance of providing a great digital experience is not new. FullStory exists because we believe that a more perfect digital experience benefits everyone–businesses and consumers alike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In many ways, that digital experience starts with a user’s first impression of your site, which is what the Page Experience signal boils down to. And with this new signal, the first impression is quantifiable, and can (and will) impact your site’s ranking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FullStory proactively surfaces friction points on your website, and helps you understand and prioritize improvements to your digital experience. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fullstory.com/signup/?freemium&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start a free trial today.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How product managers can improve cross-functional collaboration]]></title><description><![CDATA[Especially at technology-focused companies, product managers are the glue holding together an array of teams.

But there are things that may fall through the cracks without a little teamwork. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is where cross-functional collaboration can become the glue that holds teams and products together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today we ask the tough questions about cross-functional collaboration and reveal the power of building relationships. Here are the questions we’ll investigate: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does traditional product management look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What departmental skills work well cross-functionally?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the best way to collaboratively communicate with teams?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How has data enabled cross-functional collaboration?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What does traditional product management look like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Product management is a cross-functional role by nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In many organizations, product managers (PM) don&amp;#x27;t have a full team reporting to them. They get tasks done through the influence of other people working together across the organization.  A PM typically owns a specific product, vertical, or line of products, and has a small cluster of team members as frequent collaborators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Working outside of these departments essentially forces &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/product-management-challenges-2019/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;product management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to think beyond their core team of design and engineering, and more about sales and product marketing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What departmental skills work well cross-functionally?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are a handful of skills to look for in a product manager that are needed to work well across the team:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A solid technical foundation.&lt;/b&gt; A product manager needs to be able to converse on a high level with engineers and functional designers—plus help explain technical nuance to non-technical stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Influence-driven leadership. &lt;/b&gt;A skilled product manager has the ability to influence the organization without a ton of formal authority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A customer-driven mindset.&lt;/b&gt; A product manager has to have a “spidey sense” of what a well-designed and built product is from a customer standpoint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
In product management, it can be a challenge to break out of the silo of your own group. Inevitably, you have to loop the entire team in on new features and functionalities rolling out. The marketing and sales teams need to be educated on what is being built and when it&amp;#x27;s going to roll out to customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Accordingly, balancing time spent on the creation of features and building relationships around the organization is critical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s the best way to collaboratively communicate with teams?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

Product managers are constantly getting feedback from customer-facing teams about what&amp;#x27;s resonating with customers and ultimately what they want to see in the product. To collaboratively communicate with teams, it’s important to establish a clear &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/8-ways-to-prioritize-product-roadmap/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;product roadmap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so teams can communicate with each other and with external parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;There’s no doubt about it—collaborative communication is clear communication.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are some ways to break the mold with cross-functional peers, even across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dxi-globally-dispersed-teams/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;globally dispersed teams&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jump into a sales call &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read customer reviews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join a product marketing exercise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen in on a design session&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How has data enabled cross-functional collaboration?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data is a common language among teams and can be a way to drive clear, effective decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Instead of being a data-driven organization, it can be more of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dxi-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;data-informed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; organization—understanding how to use data to relate to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
When building products, a great democratizer is to have everybody clearly understand and articulate what the problem is. Most of the time, the problem can be solved with a set of data. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;With a &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; solution like FullStory, you can view customer sessions with Session Replay, and product, engineering, and UX teams will get total visibility into why customers interact the way they do.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[6 searches for tracking marketing campaigns in FullStory]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here are six ways marketers can use FullStory to track campaigns with detail and clarity. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/6-searches-for-tracking-marketing-campaigns-in-fullstory</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/6-searches-for-tracking-marketing-campaigns-in-fullstory</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Caitlin Brett]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2015 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ad campaigns and other marketing efforts — much like cats — live a mysterious life, largely outside the view of their owners. When you open the door and let your ads out into the world, it’s hard to know exactly who they interact with and what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Luckily for marketers (cat owners are not so fortunate), FullStory has an array of techniques for tracking campaigns with detail and clarity. Plus, as a customer experience platform, we go beyond just showing you the numbers and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Great marketing experiences, after all, are great customer experiences. And great customer experience &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/web-experience/poor-user-experience-slowing-conversion-rates/&quot;&gt;leads to a better conversion rate&lt;/a&gt;. FullStory, uniquely, gives you a sense of how newcomers are receiving what you’re pitching to them. We help you deliver a landing page experience that’s worth the faith your visitors put into your brand by clicking on your ad in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that you’re ready to analyze your marketing campaigns in FullStory, here are 6 searches to get you started. But the possibilities don’t end here — as with everything FullStory, there’s plenty of room for experimentation and customization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Track a campaign with a UTM parameter.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re not familiar with the concept of the &lt;i&gt;UTM parameter&lt;/i&gt;, it’s a special code appended to a link URL that works something like a beacon when it comes to tracking the link’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s the proverbial GoPro strapped to the collar of your proverbial outdoor cat. Now you can see every person she meets! Every dumpster she eats out of! Don’t you want that kind of depth and clarity when it comes to following your ad campaigns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;UTM parameters look like this: &lt;b&gt;utm_campaign=july2015&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;utm_source=twitter&lt;/b&gt;. There are different types of parameter (&lt;i&gt;campaign&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt;, shown above, are just two of these), and you can use one or all of the varieties in a single URL. &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?rd=2&quot;&gt;Google’s URL Builder tool&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to learn more and create your own trackable links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So when available, it makes sense to begin building your FullStory search by entering your UTM parameter(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The way you do this is by using &lt;b&gt;Event Scope &amp;gt; Visited page &amp;gt; has query param&lt;/b&gt; and entering your UTM parameter into the text field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Filter out your own employees.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whoops, there’s a familiar name in those search results. See [blurred]@fullstory.com? She works here, so even though she must have clicked on our ad, I want to filter her — and the rest of my coworkers — out of the results so all I see are potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So how is this task accomplished? One method I like to use is &lt;b&gt;User Scope &amp;gt; Email address &amp;gt; is not&lt;/b&gt;. By entering @fullstory.com, the search results are reduced to everyone whose email address does not contain our company email domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Check it out: she’s gone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another great way to exclude your own company’s employees is by using &lt;b&gt;User Scope &amp;gt; IP address &amp;gt; is not&lt;/b&gt;. Enter in the IP address(es) your office uses, and everyone — logged into their company accounts or not — from your location will be filtered out of the results. You can enter more than one IP address in the same search by using the blue &lt;b&gt;or&lt;/b&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. When: the best “W” since Who and What.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One thing you must be careful not to forget about FullStory is that it coalesces all of a user’s sessions from &lt;i&gt;all time&lt;/i&gt;. (Yep, every user session from the installation of the FullStory recording script to the moment you’re reading this sentence.) That means the users in your new segment may have already visited your site, potentially days, months, or years before clicking on your ad. But what if you only want to see users who visited your site for the first time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To revisit our proverbial cat, imagine that we want her to go into the attic and catch the mouse that lives up there, but when we watch the GoPro footage, we see she ate a mouse &lt;i&gt;two weeks ago,&lt;/i&gt; before ever exploring the attic. That information is useless to us — the two actions are completely unrelated! And there’s still a %$#^ mouse in the attic!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Well, here’s the thing. FullStory doesn’t have a perfect solution for this. Yet. But you can narrow down your list to users who &lt;i&gt;never visited your site before the ads started running&lt;/i&gt;, which is a pretty darn good solution, by using &lt;b&gt;User Scope &amp;gt; First seen &amp;gt; is after&lt;/b&gt;. It’s like only looking at mice that were eaten after we opened the attic door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Conversion tracking, the matter of all importance.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The burning question, of course, is whether people clicking on your ad are &lt;i&gt;converting&lt;/i&gt;, or, in essence, doing what you wanted them to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your goal for your marketing campaign was just to track clicks to your site, then awesome! You’re done right now! But if you want to look at something more complicated, like forms submitted or site sign-ups, you have more work to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is where the incredible specificity of FullStory’s data collection really comes into play. Whatever your conversion goal is, you can track it with FullStory. And you don’t need to instrument it ahead of time by setting up a goal (&lt;i&gt;a la&lt;/i&gt; Google Analytics) or placing a tracking pixel on your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Think about your conversion action. What does the user actually &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; to fulfill this goal? What action do they take on your site? And how can you turn that into a FullStory search?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your conversion action is to fill out a form, click a button, or otherwise interact with a certain element of your site, use the powerful CSS selection tools. **Event Scope &amp;gt; Clicked &amp;gt; CSS selector **allows you to specify the CSS class or ID of the element you’re tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In my case, I’m going to search on &lt;b&gt;Event Scope &amp;gt; Visited page &amp;gt; is&lt;/b&gt;, and enter &lt;code&gt;https://www.fullstory.com/signup?success&lt;/code&gt;. This is a page on the FullStory site that’s loaded every time a user successfully signs up for a trial, so I can infer that anyone who’s visited this page has completed the conversion goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Bounce. The un-fun kind.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One thing all marketers are concerned about is &lt;i&gt;bounce&lt;/i&gt;: when a person visits a site but immediately leaves. It’s way less fun than it sounds, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bounce can be caused by a variety of things, so it’s important to figure out both how many visitors are bouncing and &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;. Analytics tools like Google Analytics and Mixpanel can only show us the former, but FullStory, magically, can do both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To get only bouncing users, it’s handy to use one of FullStory’s time-based search queries. I tend to set bounce at 30 seconds, so I’ll enter &lt;b&gt;User Scope &amp;gt; Total Active Time &amp;gt; at most &amp;gt; 30 &amp;gt; seconds&lt;/b&gt;, but you can set whatever threshold is appropriate for your use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that you have your bouncing visitors, you can watch some sessions to find out &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; they’re bouncing. FullStory lets you see all sorts of user pain points from confusing design to JavaScript errors. (And, in the case of the latter, or any bug, FullStory also lets you inspect the faulty code.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Knowing the reasons for bounce helps you make the necessary adjustments to promote more visitor engagement, which will ultimately lead to more conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why is your bounce rate different in Google Analytics?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We don’t like to outright say someone is wrong, but, well, Google Analytics doesn’t give you the full story &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009409?hl=en&quot;&gt;on the subject of bounce&lt;/a&gt;. Because GA doesn’t measure &lt;i&gt;every interaction&lt;/i&gt; on the page like FullStory does, it has no way of knowing how long someone spends on your landing page. It can only determine active time if a user navigates to a second page; then it compares the timestamps between the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This method is, at best, inaccurate. If you have a landing page loaded with information, or an increasingly trendy single-page site, the user could spend minutes or hours reading your content and GA would still consider it a bounce, just because they didn’t navigate to any additional pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. Go deep with demographics.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The richness of the User Scope category allows you to search for demographic subsections of your results, such as mobile visitors, visitors using Chrome, visitors from Canada, or virtually any other criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, go figure out what your cats are up to.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you can see, tracking marketing campaigns in FullStory is easy, enlightening, and endlessly detailed. Using the ideas above, you should be able to craft a FullStory search of your very own to wrangle those cats and get some data-fueled insights into the performance of your campaigns!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Have you been tracking your marketing efforts in FullStory?

As the world’s largest online thrift and consignment store, thredUP’s entire inventory is temporary — every single item that’s in stock has a total quantity of one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Backed by more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thredup#/entity&quot;&gt;$131 million in funding&lt;/a&gt;, thredUP was founded in 2009 and has weathered storms both in the economy and in its vertical to become one of the standout startups in the e-commerce space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A large part of that success has been thredUP’s strong engineering culture, led by VP Engineering Dan DeMeyere, and their obsession with improving customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether it’s fixing bugs, doing user research, or gauging the success of a product launch, DeMeyere and his team try to understand what users are &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; experiencing — not just how many sessions are active or how much “engagement” they’re seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We talked to Dan about how FullStory and Rollbar combine to help thredUP better understand their users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No more mysteries in user experience.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;DeMeyere’s team at thredUP use a combination of Rollbar and FullStory to understand and solve problems. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rollbar.com/&quot;&gt;Rollbar&lt;/a&gt;, an exception management tool, allows thredUP to monitor particular types of in-app events, analyze the causes of bugs, and fix them. FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#what-is-session-replay-useful-for&quot;&gt;session replay provides much-needed context&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The thredUP team first discovered FullStory’s capabilities when their marketing team began using a site-wide A/B testing system. One of their first tests involved promotions. The product team wanted to show discount codes selectively to only a certain segment of customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They set up the A/B test; all appeared to be running smoothly. But they soon noticed that the people who weren’t being shown discounts were still applying them once they got to their cart — and they had no idea why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There were no obvious bugs in the code. They configured Rollbar to alert an engineer anytime a customer in the no-discount segment applied a discount code to their cart. For a week, thredUP engineers sat and watched as customer after customer somehow slipped the parameters of their test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The breakthrough came when they turned to FullStory and watched what was happening on-screen for the affected users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“It was very obscure, but there was this very old system that we had for the way we do our carts that would do an up-sell to somebody based on a certain referral code,” DeMeyere says, “We weren’t finding it in our code, but we were able to rewind and &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; the customer paste in that value in the promotion field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Once we figured that out [through watching session replays we] were able to move quickly and fix it, and that’s when the power [of FullStory] became really apparent to us,” he adds. “We might have been pulling our hair out for weeks had we not thought to use FullStory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session replay is instant, bias-free user research.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory session replay helps thredUP understand how the changes they make to their site impact users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When the thredUP team set out to build a new version of their product, they knew it would be a total overhaul of the shopping experience on their site. There would be a complete architecture rewrite on the back-end, and a complete teardown of the UI/UX on the front. Everything was going to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The product team needed to see if people were using the new site and all its new features the way they were hoping they would. They had certain hypotheses, and they just needed to test them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If everything was so simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Testing user behavior through traditional research had inescapable problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional user research often involves (intentionally or inadvertently) asking leading questions: “If you were going to do &lt;i&gt;x … &lt;/i&gt;how would you do that right now?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research studies often aren’t very indicative of how users actually behave — especially thredUP’s heavy user base of busy moms who don’t have the time to poke around the UI to discover the features they require.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Even still, thredUP had plenty of data at their disposal — sessions, visits, engagement around clicks, impressions for modal windows. They even had the resources to crunch the data. Yet it wasn’t enough. They struggled to explain as some users deviated from expected behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That’s when the light bulb to use FullStory went off. Here’s DeMeyere:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything kind of changed. The problem we were trying to solve, that FullStory did a much better job of solving than some of the other services that we were using, was trying to understand &lt;b&gt;what our customers are actually doing&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rollbar and FullStory combine for faster, better bug diagnostics.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory started as a tool for thredUP’s product team to do user research and understand the impact of new features, but the engineering team quickly adopted it for another purpose — better bug fixing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But it didn’t happen instantly. There was concern among the engineers that recording the actions of users on every page across the thredUP website was going to have an impact on performance. When pages load slowly, shoppers leave, so getting assurance on performance was a Big Deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The good news was that FullStory doesn’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624094&quot;&gt;delay the loading of pages&lt;/a&gt; — with the gzipped version (16kb) edge-cached on Google’s CDN, FullStory’s recording script (&lt;code&gt;fs.js&lt;/code&gt;) is usually fetched in under 20ms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whatever concerns about performance evaporated once thredUP’s engineers got into a few session replays and were able to see people actually navigating their site. Soon, the engineering team came to find it an invaluable tool for understanding bugs and replicating them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before FullStory, thredUP fixed bugs like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Document everything that’s been tested,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collect more data,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for patterns,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are exceptions all around one browser?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are exceptions all around one acquisition channel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Repeat until bug’s unique fingerprint is found.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It is almost impossible to fix a bug if you can’t replicate it, but if you can replicate it, you can form a hypothesis as to why it’s happening, test different kinds of input, collect a bunch of data around each test, and start to get closer to understanding what’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This process can take a very long time. Many times it never happens. &lt;i&gt;Not reproducible.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;thredUP found a solution to this problem was to plug user information from Rollbar into FullStory and then watch &lt;i&gt;as their customer themselves produced the bugs!&lt;/i&gt; That resulted in saving time and frustration, faster bug fixes, and most importantly, a better customer experience. Here’s DeMeyere:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any time we can make engineers move faster and be more productive with tooling that doesn’t cost us an insane amount of money, then we’re probably gonna opt for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The FullStory perspective.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data-driven decision making is often a point of pride within the tech companies. And there’s nothing wrong with data! The problems come when companies find themselves relying too much on aggregated data and abstracted models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That can mean seeing metrics rather than the actual people who drive those metrics. It can mean building products that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/see-beyond-the-average/&quot;&gt;designed for the average instead of the individual&lt;/a&gt;. Soon we’re spending less time understanding customer experience — less time paying attention to how they use our products. And sometimes your bug reporting structure evolves into a byzantine bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It doesn’t need to be that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;thredUP found it’s possible to move fast &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; be obsessed with building a great experience for your customers — by making sure that even as a multi-million dollar business, the capability is still there to look through our users’ eyes and see what’s actually going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanks Dan DeMeyere at thredUP for sharing how thredUP is using FullStory!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zenstores puts FullStory to work for support, engagement, and conversion optimization]]></title><description><![CDATA[Using FullStory for support, app usage, and marketing funnels   from Zenstores.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/zenstores-puts-fullstory-to-work-for-support-ui-and-marketing</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/zenstores-puts-fullstory-to-work-for-support-ui-and-marketing</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin Owings]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today in our series of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/use-cases&quot;&gt;FullStory customer use-cases&lt;/a&gt; we hear from Alex Myers, Head of Marketing at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zenstores.com/&quot;&gt;Zenstores&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not familiar, Zenstores is a platform that helps e-commerce businesses manage sales distribution and understand sales trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Zenstores puts FullStory to work across their organization for customer support, app development/UI, and marketing through allowing Zenstores to step into the minds of their customers through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;session playback&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Below, Alex tells us all about it. Read on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using FullStory for Zenstores Customer Support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer testimonial from Alex Myers, Head of Marketing at Zenstores&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our customers at Zenstores are busy online retailers and our software is a critical part of their dispatch process. That means that when they have an issue we need to solve it asap to prevent disruption to their operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our primary support channels are email, phone, and in-app chat, all of which are limited by the fact that our understanding of the problem a user is facing is dependent on their ability to clearly explain it. Ideally, we’d want to be in the same room as the customer, seeing what they’re seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We resolve many of our customer support inquiries in half the time we used to thanks to FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory makes that possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We can watch a customer using our app, see the context of the issue they encountered and formulate clear advice on how to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We resolve many of our customer support inquiries in half the time we used to thanks to FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory for Zenstores App Usage and Product Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our goal at Zenstores is to continually iterate our products to make them as intuitive and valuable to our users as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before using FullStory we combined user interviews and small-scale in-person user-testing with quantitative data such as heatmaps and event based tracking of how users were engaging with our product. This worked OK but our qualitative methods always felt like we were at arms-length from our users, and quantitative data is inherently impersonal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By adding FullStory to this mix we have a way of conducting unbiased user-testing of our products at scale without having to be physically looking over each user’s shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This has enabled us to spot common UI issues incredibly quickly, as well as uncover some niche behaviors that with follow-up customer interviews have unearthed interesting applications for our products that we’d previously never considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory for increasing &lt;i&gt;conversion funnel&lt;/i&gt; efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Like any SaaS product Zenstores has a variety of carefully considered conversion funnels to our free trial sign up that we’d like prospective customers from different acquisition channels to flow through. FullStory gives us the ability to see exactly how a user did or more importantly &lt;i&gt;didn’t&lt;/i&gt; flow through that path the way we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I think the word ‘flow’ is important here, because while analytics-focused tools give you exact data around conversion rates across every micro-step of a users’ journey, they don’t give marketers the whole picture. They don’t capture that mouse movement towards the pricing page before the distraction of a newsletter signup modal appears, or the clicks on an element that isn’t a button, but according to the user &lt;i&gt;looks&lt;/i&gt; like a button. They don’t capture the long pause over a paragraph of copy or a graphic that’s clearly left them confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory lets you see these nuances of a user’s flow through your carefully constructed landing pages in a way that feels very human, and for a marketer trying to find the best way to engage with an audience, that’s incredibly valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanks for sharing, Alex!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FullStory here.&lt;/b&gt; We are happy to hear from Alex how FullStory is doing so much for Zenstores — whether it’s saving time in customer support, lending an unbiased look at app usage, or providing a much-needed human look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-fullstory-on-funnels/&quot;&gt;conversion funnels&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Your users' desire paths pave the way to better digital experiences]]></title><description><![CDATA[Desire paths are more than shortcuts.

Whether it’s the way to work, or the way through the grocery store, we try to optimize our route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When we walk the same ground enough we wear down the low-lying vegetation — the grass — and we create a visible path in the dirt. A trail where there was none before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No authority planned it. No one designed it. Yet there it is as clear as day — a path to follow that sorta just makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A path was desired&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s the result of individual choices aggregating together and creating something meaningful. Spontaneous, emergent order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s a name for these worn paths — “desire paths.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path&quot;&gt;Wikipedia tells us&lt;/a&gt; that desire paths are also known as game trails, social trails, herd paths, cow paths, goat tracks, pig trails, or bootleg trails. They’re also sometimes referred to as desire lines. Extremely worn desire paths might even take on the shape of tunnels that are known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunken_lane&quot;&gt;sunken lanes&lt;/a&gt; or hollow ways (“holloways,” too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But there’s no official name for desire paths, really, and that makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Desire paths are the physical manifestation of an intangible truth: life finds a way. There is an innate, instinctual drive to take advantage of every opportunity and bridge every gap. A drive to take the shortest cut and blaze a trail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because desire paths are born from life, where ever you find life, you find desire paths. So what do we do with them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Stop them — desire paths are a nuisance!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Are desire paths bad? Is taking them wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The paved sidewalks and chained-in grassy areas on college campuses and public parks suggest they are a problem to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Please stay off the grass!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Desire paths should be stopped — they’re a nuisance. Taking a shortcut through the landscaped common area in lieu of a paved route is not the way things were designed. You’re supposed to follow the marked sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Does anyone believe this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s research that suggests we make choices based on perceived effort[1] — preferring the apparent “path of least resistance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Really, it’s human nature to question the rules — particularly those rules that feel arbitrary. Adhering to rules that cost us dearly (And what’s more expensive than our time?) are especially unlikely to be followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So while desire paths may scar a meticulously designed and beautifully maintained landscape, objecting to or trying to stop their use is a Sisyphean task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If stopping desire paths is a waste of time, what are we to do with them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The opportunity in plain-sight — pave the desire paths&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When Walt Disney created Disneyland, he didn’t fence in the grassy areas until he saw where people walked. The most frequently used walkways — as indicated by desire paths — got codified into official sidewalks[2]. Frank Lloyd Wright was said to apply the same tactic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Or take universities. Instead of trying to predict, in advance, where students will walk the most, some campus planners plant the grass and just sit back and wait — the paths present themselves in short order once school is in session. From there, they need only pave them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Student lore at Michigan State University (seen below), Ohio State University, and Reed College&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-are-desire-paths-and-how-use-desire-paths-for-design-and-development/#fn3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; all talks of how this was the process that drove their campus sidewalk layouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s a power in desire paths that simply requires a change of frame — desire paths aren’t a problem to be a solved so much as a solution that has been rendered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;See the desire path and make it better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you’ve likely realized, desire paths aren’t limited to dirt. Desire paths are symbolic of how people figure out new and easier ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/&quot;&gt;get some job done&lt;/a&gt;. If you see a desire path, you’ve got a blinking light of opportunity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Take the rough-hewn path and make it better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The internet is a great green grassy space&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The internet is a frontier for creation — new sites, services, platforms, apps, whatever. Within these creations users have immense freedom to go their own way. Desire paths are a natural outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Even within this frontier space there are limitations and constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Connectivity to the Internet leaves users feeling time-constrained — there are so many possibilities it can be overwhelming. Thanks to our always-on, always-available status, not a moment goes by when we aren’t able to pursue &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;. We’re left distracted, anxious, and irritated in the event that our changing whims can’t be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yet these constraints drive innovation: create a better way to get from point A to B — desire paths and the Internet go hand-in-hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s consider a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Messaging services — AIM to WhatsApp to WeChat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Messaging has been around for awhile and it’s gone through a number of iterations — messaging desire paths get paved, things change, and then they’re replaced by better solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the most basic level, messaging emerged as a direct, instant way to communicate by text with other people. It came about in the 1990’s through ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and sidestepped email by being a faster, less formal way to communicate asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve come a long way since then, but the evolution of messaging is far from over. Paint a broad stroke and you see how SMS and MMS limits — in number of messages or the expense of one-off messages — led to users taking the desire path of using over-the-air services like iMessage, Google Hangouts, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While it’s not taken off in the U.S. as much as abroad, the simplicity of chat as an instant interface to transact has led to an explosion of chat functionality in apps like WeChat in China (which all sorts of e-commerce can take place within the app, itself). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the idea of shopping by chat may feel foreign to many in the U.S., it’s native behavior to many in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Separately, there’s the trend to “chatbot all the things.” Here, messaging can be seen as a way for users to interact with a business however they choose, and if the chatbot works, users build their desire path on-the-fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And a third messaging-related example is chat-based customer support services (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/&quot;&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt;). When users feel the marked paths leave them feeling lost with no clear way to go, these services give them a paved path toward getting answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Smartphones — desire path engines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Smartphones exploded in popularity because they paved the path that previous connected devices were only lightly facilitating — that is, browsing the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before the iPhone, using OTA messaging services, taking and sharing photos, etc., in feature phones like the Blackberry Curve, while possible, was clunky and painful. The experience for users felt bolted-on instead of native.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The iPhone (and Android) paved the desire path for using mobile Internet by making it the prime function of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once that path was paved — access and functionality on mobile — smartphone platforms became the wide open greens that facilitate a near limitless potential for desire paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Taking it even further, you can see apps as paved desire paths for what users would otherwise do on a browser. And today, as smartphones get more sensors, faster connections, and more processing power, the frontier of mobile grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Twitter and Instagram — social streams of constraints and desire&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Twitter is a study in constraints and desire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hashtags and at replies were early desire paths that users carved into the Twitter-sphere that Twitter ultimately made native to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Image-sharing is another example. Twitter didn’t build in this functionality so users created the desire paths — sharing links to image-sharing services to work around the problem. That desire path got paved when Twitter brought the functionality in-house but it arguably happened too late — a separate image sharing service had paved it better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Meet Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Or look at Twitter’s character limit. While it’s not going away, Twitter users can easily circumvent the character limits using images. If you want to share more than 140 characters — maybe you want to share a quote from an article or a book or you wrote a note on your phone — simply do a screenshot on your phone and share that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Shifting to Instagram. Here’s a platform where image sharing is primary. Smartphones exploded in popularity because they paved the path that earlier devices were only lightly facilitating — that is, browsing the Internet.and text secondary. Many social media influencers (e.g. celebrities) have amassed huge Instagram followings and use Instagram as their primary channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what do these influencers do when they have something to say on Instagram? Like on Twitter, they screenshot their phones — either a written note or whatever — and share that[4].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Benedict Evans has pointed to screenshots on phones as desire paths to fill unmet needs within apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Other examples of Instagram paving desire paths abound — from collages to carousels to (arguably) co-opting Snapchat’s story functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google is a desire path paving machine. Where do you want to go? Google takes you there — “10 blue links” that get you from Point A to B in milliseconds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google is well-known for paving desire paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, Google has started surfacing the answers right in the search engine results page requiring no further work on the part of users — as is the case with Knowledge Graph cards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In some cases, Google surfacing quotes from top results for a query has dramatically impacted the downstream websites from which the answers came.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another example of Google paving a desire path is when the answer to a query surfaces right there in the auto-suggest box — before you even execute the search!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Internet is a massive green space across which desire paths are being cut all the time, in apps, devices, and websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What other examples can you think of?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Desire paths and web design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To build a successful website—or SaaS—you have to drive users to sign-up, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/books/onboarding&quot;&gt;successfully onboard them&lt;/a&gt;, and do the job promised well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Developers have struggled to see how users engage with their websites, apps, and products. Outcomes could be measured using analytical services (e.g. Google Analytics), but actually seeing where users are going and intuiting what they’re trying to do in any given situation was near impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That’s why &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory session replay is so powerful&lt;/a&gt;—it reveals where the “paved sidewalk” (a web site’s layout, app UX/UI, whatever) isn’t working as intended as well as visualizing, literally where the users are trying to go. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;Using session replay to see user flows&lt;/a&gt; helps developers and designers improve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s a little known fact that the original code name for FullStory was CowPaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Separately from surfacing user desire paths, FullStory also helps with the desire paths of designers, product managers, and engineers — by allowing them to search user interactions for whatever behavior they need to understand. What users click a certain button? Use a certain feature? Abandon their cart or get lost in your knowledge base? &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;Just search it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Just as much Google search is a desire path paving engine for bringing users to the world’s information, FullStory provides that power for an organizations’ user interactions on their web app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With or without a service like FullStory, understanding a user’s desire paths on your site can make the difference between success and failure. No business is immune to the constraints on time and attention for users — getting them from point A to point B on your site so they can do whatever it is they’re trying to do — well, that’s our job as builders of products and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And it helps to mind the desire paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What desire path is your life on?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope is like a path in the countryside. Originally, there is nothing — but as people walk this way again and again, a path appears. —  Lu Xun, Chinese Essayists, 1921&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We all make plans, but life happens, anyway. Desire paths result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Instead of relegating ourselves to plodding down the same desire paths we’ve walked countless times before, perhaps it’s time to make them better — whether in business, in design, or in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What desire paths do you take?

TST’s customers include both online travel shoppers as well as travel agencies and home-based travel agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Booking travel is massively complex — the possible combinations of destinations to &lt;code&gt;airlines x routes x times x prices&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(hotels OR Airbnb) x specific area&lt;/code&gt; — it’s enough to make your head spin. Every customer’s experience is unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To further complicate things for TST, their product integrates with many different external providers, some of them still running on old mainframe backend systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Things can and do go wrong, but TST is using FullStory across their engineering, support, and design teams to diagnose errors, solve for customer unhappiness through support, and build a better user experience (UX) with design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Understanding the Errors That Cause Failed Bookings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;TST has been using FullStory for about six months in their Production process to help capture and understand when things go wrong. David Gilicasals, a software engineer at TST, wrote in to share how FullStory is helping them understand what happens when things don’t go as expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s David:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;With our existing logging and analytics tools we’ve been able to capture and be notified of customer’s failed bookings. But this is just one part of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other things could go wrong before the customer even gets to click that final ‘Book my trip’ button. In some cases, our logs may not give us that information, forcing us to go find a specific log message in a haystack of log messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So one of our first FullStory segments and funnels was to track our conversions and find out any errors that occurred throughout a booking process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finding the “needle in a haystack” is a forte of FullStory — both in the ability to search on any behavior (And build a funnel or segment) and the assurance that all the user interactions have been captured. No needle can hide for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;TST Uses FullStory for Customer Support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Prior to FullStory, David shared that TST relied on a process whereby customers who landed on the “Uh oh, your booking failed” could call a travel agent to report the problem. This caused a ticket with a simple screenshot attached to it to be created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Often important information from the customer’s experience would get lost in translation or not be totally accurate. Other times, TST simply needed additional details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On using FullStory the process was changed dramatically. David writes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going from a screenshot and a brief description to a FullStory playback session has been a game changer and has made our engineers and QA life much happier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— David Gilicasals, Travel Syndication Technology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What more, TST “recently integrated FullStory into our travel administration console so we can now access the FullStory session for any successful or failed booking just by clicking a simple button.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Helping customer support agents understand a customer’s problem at the click of a button is one of the great benefits of integrating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;FullStory session replay&lt;/a&gt; with existing support systems. It’s human-powered but scales. Bionic!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Building a Better User Experience (UX) With Click Maps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;TST uses FullStory to understand and improve user experience on their site through both session replay and click maps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/introducing-page-insights-with-click-maps-and-inspect-mode/&quot;&gt;Click Maps are FullStory&amp;#x27;s solution&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-are-web-heatmaps-how-do-they-work-pros-cons-alternatives/&quot;&gt;the problems of heat maps&lt;/a&gt;. Click Maps aggregate user clicks on elements from any given state within your web app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s a shot of TST&amp;#x27;s app as seen through FullStory Click Maps. Note how each number item provides specific information about how many clicks the item received relative to the aggregate as well as what percentage of users clicked:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A glimpse at TST’s app as viewed through &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/introducing-page-insights-with-click-maps-and-inspect-mode/&quot;&gt;FullStory Click Maps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s David on the insights provided through FullStory Click Maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last area where we believe FullStory is going to provide a lot of value is in designing a better user experience to our customers. By replaying selected user sessions, we can now more easily visualize how our customers effectively use our site and find some of the friction points in our user interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;b&gt;the ‘click map’ functionality has already surprised us in several cases by showing us how customers interact in a way we didn’t anticipate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now know that 20% of customers looking for a flight will update their initial search criteria to find other potential options, but only less than 1% will use the flexible date functionality that we provide as an easier way to compare flights in different dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fascinating to hear that only about 1% of fliers are open to trying the flexible date functionality within TST’s app — but 20X as many users are willing to change smaller elements of their flight itinerary and search again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can take Page Insights Click Maps with a FullStory trial — or if you are already a FullStory user, take a spin through a case study for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/features/click-maps/&quot;&gt;how you can put Click Map analysis to work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’re excited that TST is putting that functionality to good use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory is “Indispensable”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;David wrapped TST’s experience using FullStory by saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;FullStory has very quickly become an indispensable tool for our product owners, engineers, QA, and support staff.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— David Gilicasals, Travel Syndication Technology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How FullStory helps Clubhouse save time]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Clubhouse team shares with us how FullStory session replay is used to diagnose bugs quickly and solve issues around design.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-helps-clubhouse-save-time</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-helps-clubhouse-save-time</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin Owings]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2017 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Clubhouse has built &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clubhouse.io/&quot;&gt;a project management platform&lt;/a&gt; that helps software engineering teams work through the stages of planning, building, and deploying their products. We’re intimately familiar with Clubhouse at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt; — because we’re Clubhouse customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Camille Acey, VP of Customer Success and Pavla Mikula, Customer Success Lead shared with us how FullStory session replay is used to diagnose bugs quickly and solve issues around design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Show, don’t tell with FullStory.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s a writing technique known as “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don%27t_tell&quot;&gt;Show, don’t tell&lt;/a&gt;” that’s employed by authors ranging from Ernest Hemingway to Chuck Palahniuk. The concept is simple: rather than describe to a reader what a particular experience causes one to think or feel, let the reader experience the situation through their senses and through action — the readers will automatically fill in the intangible blanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Showing&lt;/i&gt; can elicit a more powerful response in the reader than the writer can achieve through merely telling (or narrating) a character’s thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The concept of showing over telling is what makes visualizations so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That brings us to FullStory. Camille at Clubhouse shares how FullStory session replay is a (moving) picture worth a “million” words:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As humans we are often guilty of struggling to communicate problems verbally, especially when we are confused or frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a picture is worth a thousand words then a moving picture must be worth a million, and being able to see just what our users are looking at (and having trouble with!) helps us get to the root of the problem and more quickly come up with a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rather than using words to explain some customer’s experience to a co-worker, product manager, or engineer, FullStory enables the Clubhouse team to see what is happening with their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Words become optional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory helps Clubhouse observe the unexpected.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Clubhouse Customer Success Lead Pavla Mikula has found similar benefits from using FullStory. Below Pavla talks about using FullStory to see and understand unexpected behaviors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recently launched two new reporting features around Burndown Charts and Cumulative Flow Diagrams, which are visual representations of work completed over time. &lt;b&gt;Customers often have questions about how new features [like these] work and FullStory has been a huge time-saver in regards to solving issues&lt;/b&gt; around things not looking right in graphs or charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been able to immediately see if something in our UI is producing an unexpected behavior (like a filter being turned on) and &lt;b&gt;using FullStory to diagnose bugs in this context has been a game changer — no screenshots required!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’re happy to move away from the useful-but-overly-flat screenshot! Thanks to FullStory automatically recording user sessions, Clubhouse has an instantly available treasure trove of “session screenshots” to help teams understand and diagnose behaviors on demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Press play for immediate understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session replay with FullStory search saves time.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session replay delivers a more immediate and higher-quality understanding that saves teams (precious) time in iterating and improving their product. Combined with FullStory’s ability to search all user behaviors — and pull up any session replay on-demand — you have a rapid-fire engine for solving customer and product problems that touch any aspect of your site (i.e. product, design, marketing, whatever).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s no wonder that Clubhouse co-founder Andrew Childs has said there were bugs that the Clubhouse team had been trying to reproduce for months that they were able to see and debug within minutes once using FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what’s the value in the time your team saves by showing rather than telling?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Time saved means better products, faster.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Expressed in terms of product development, when engineers lose time to reproducing bugs it is incredibly expensive&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-helps-clubhouse-save-time/#fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. Saving that time not only means more time spent making the product better, it also means more motivated engineers. Features and product improvements get built sooner and refined faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In terms of customer success, getting that much-needed empathy from users is flat-out easier — less exasperation on the part of both customer &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; customer success agent. The time saved equates to more efficient customer success organizations (Saving the business money) and happier customers. Happier customers don’t churn as often, increasing lifetime value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’re happy FullStory is helping Clubhouse save time so they can get back to improving their product even more.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How FullStory helps TravelPerk give first-class customer service]]></title><description><![CDATA[Solving UX problems, going live with customer support, and finding the bugs that hurt Net Promoter Scores.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/travelperk-improves-nps-empowers-customer-support-and-solves-ux-with-session-replay-through/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/travelperk-improves-nps-empowers-customer-support-and-solves-ux-with-session-replay-through/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin Owings]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2017 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tagged/fullstories&quot;&gt;FullStory use-case&lt;/a&gt; comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelperk.com/&quot;&gt;TravelPerk&lt;/a&gt;, a free web app that allows you to book and manage your business travel, helping with price comparisons and centralizing invoicing and reporting (and can also be integrated with tools like Expensify).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;An in-app screenshot from the TravelPerk app, a free web app that allows you to book and manage your business travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/u/6f480fadce16&quot;&gt;Chris Roy&lt;/a&gt;, Lead User Experience Designer at TravelPerk, shared how his team and others at TravelPerk use FullStory &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/introducing-page-insights-with-click-maps-and-inspect-mode/&quot;&gt;click maps&lt;/a&gt; to investigate &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#support-customers-faster-through-context&quot;&gt;support customers through context&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#reproduce-solve-bugs-faster&quot;&gt;solve bugs&lt;/a&gt; in JIRA, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read on to see how TravelPerk is putting Fullstory to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How TravelPerk uses FullStory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Notes from Chris Roy, Lead UX designer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.travelperk.com/&quot;&gt;TravelPerk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Going Live With Customers Using FullStory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having just installed FullStory on TravelPerk, we were on a call with a new client who — midway through the call — sounded like she was struggling with something on the site. Within moments, I was able to show via FullStory’s live stream exactly what she was doing. I showed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/want-to-co-browse-with-your-customers-in-real-time-go-live-with-fullstory&quot;&gt;live playback&lt;/a&gt; to our Account Director and he was amazed. He muted the call and said, “How can you see that!?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Going live was great as it allowed us to course-correct the client without having to go offline, dig into some numbers and event tracking, and then get back to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With FullStory we could see exactly what she was doing while still being on the call with her. It was like screen sharing but without the painful set up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Integrating FullStory With Intercom and Zendesk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another benchmark moment was when I went crazy with integrations and had FullStory connected with Intercom, Trello, Google Analytics, MixPanel, Slack, and Zendesk&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/travelperk-improves-nps-empowers-customer-support-and-solves-ux-with-session-replay-through/#fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. I ran a couple of workshops just to run through the tool and specifically how our Customer Support Agents could troubleshoot in depth with any questions or comments which they received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A typical support ticket would involve a lot of back and forth trying to clarify the steps that user took when they stumbled upon an issue. Problem is a lot of things are done by users subconsciously, so it is not easy to recall all the minute details — the details that really help when debugging. Now, with the click of a button, a Customer Support Agent, Product Owner, or Designer can see exactly what happened during the session, including the ability to see any console logs or additional meta data that could help find the source of an issue — and do it all within moments, not hours or days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Looking for Patterns in Behavior&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another thing I personally love to do as a UX Designer is watch a couple of sessions and spot patterns where it looks like people are struggling. This may start with the Rage Click filter&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/travelperk-improves-nps-empowers-customer-support-and-solves-ux-with-session-replay-through/#fn2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After seeing someone struggle with a part of the UI, I can then run a search on that part of the TravelPerk application and watch a bunch of other sessions. With very little effort, you can easily spot some friction points that could otherwise go unnoticed. It is a real game-changer in the sense that you can proactively solve problems&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/travelperk-improves-nps-empowers-customer-support-and-solves-ux-with-session-replay-through/#fn3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; before people start telling you about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here a TravelPerk user had a “dead click” on an element within the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Solving Low Net Promoter Scores (NPS) With FullStory and JIRA Integration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a similar light, we recently received an NPS score of 6 from a customer (which is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a regular thing), so I quickly jumped in to replay the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To my horror, I saw that the customer tried to input the same information into a form 8 times. She tried logging out and in and coming back to that screen but it kept failing to accept her input. A quick search on FullStory and I realised that 12 other people had been affected by this bug. Using the JIRA integration¹, I immediately raised a critical issue and we had it fixed and in production within hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Trying to figure out this issue “the old way” could have taken days, frustrating a lot more customers. This is where the tool really pays back on the investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To the Future!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition to the above, I have also used Page Insights at times to understand aggregated behavior on a page — it can be a good guide for spotting dead link patterns or key interactions within a given context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A screenshot of Page Insights Click Maps for the TravelPerk app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I am super excited to see how FullStory progresses even further as I think what you have delivered so far is a real breath of fresh air in the analysis of product performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Being a UX Designer, it also gives me a vast wealth of “what people do” vs “what people say” content which can be great when you are looking to make decisions on new features or improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Chris further shared that when TravelPerk originally looked at FullStory they only expected to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/free/&quot;&gt;FullStory Free&lt;/a&gt;; however, after using the features of FullStory Pro, Chris easily convinced his company to subscribe. We couldn’t be more excited to hear of the success TravelPerk has had with FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The hidden costs of choosing the wrong analytics tool]]></title><description><![CDATA[Free web analytics tools don't exist.

Yet determining which web analytics software your organization should use can be terrifying. Countless analytics programs exist—Google Analytics, Adobe, Mixpanel, Crazy Egg, Piwik, Alexa, Quantcast, KISSmetrics, Clicktale, Tealeaf, Similarweb, Amplitude, &lt;i&gt;FullStory&lt;/i&gt; (we hope) to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics&quot;&gt;any number of other tools&lt;/a&gt;—and open source web analytics tools, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do you decide which tool(s) to pick—and is there really such a thing as a &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; analytics tool? &lt;b&gt;What is the real cost of web analytics tools?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s more complicated than it seems, so we&amp;#x27;re sharing a framework for analyzing the fully-baked cost of web analytics tools. It covers everything from the sticker price, to implementation costs, impacts on performance, data quality (relevance, reliability, and cognitive bias), and even the costs your tools create when it comes to running analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There&amp;#x27;s much to consider beneath the surface of any given analytics tool, so buckle up—that fancy, &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; analytics tool may cost more than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Spoiler alert: there&amp;#x27;s no such thing as a free analytics tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Analyzing the Cost of Web Analytics Tools—a Framework.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. The cost of the tool (or tools), itself.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The “sticker price” of a particular tool is the most easily quantifiable cost of data analysis — and it’s also where discussion around analytics tools can get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many analytics tools are free — i.e. there is no monthly fee to use them. Google Analytics is free. FullStory offers a free version, too, as do many other analytics platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Outside of a free tool, there are, of course, paid, subscription-based web analytics software options. These paid services can vary dramatically in price depending on lots of factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When estimating the cost of web analytics, &lt;b&gt;“free” or “paid” should only be the beginning.&lt;/b&gt; Don’t get stuck on the sticker price of a tool — &lt;i&gt;particularly&lt;/i&gt; if that price is “free.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Have you ever heard the expression, “There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch?” “TANSTAAFL” is a popular phrase in economics&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-high-cost-of-web-analytics/#fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that reminds us that everything has a cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free web analytics tools don&amp;#x27;t exist. TANSTAAFL.&lt;/b&gt; Why? Because it&amp;#x27;s all the other costs that make web analytics tools expensive. Consider the costs to implement the tool, its effect on your site or app&amp;#x27;s performance, data quality costs, integration costs, and the costs to extract the insights—these are the real underlying factors that make web analytics tools expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So start at the sticker price, but keep going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. The cost to implement the tool.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No magic wand exists that will install a given analytics tool&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-high-cost-of-web-analytics/#fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and implementing a tracking code across your web site or app can get downright complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Depending on how your site or app is built, it can require any number of code injections — from putting code into proprietary, one-off pages to including it in the headers of templates, into widgets in Content Management Systems, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Managing implementation never really stops — as your site or app grows and changes, it has to be maintained. The more complexity baked into your analytics tool, the more expensive maintenance can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Estimating the cost of implementation requires identifying what team or individual will own the process and factoring in the cost of their time.&lt;/b&gt; The cost to install and maintain analytics code can be measured by in terms of both salary and the work they aren’t doing — time spent maintaining analytics code is time not spent fixing bugs, improving the product, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. The cost of the tool on performance.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every bit of code on your site or app has the potential to effect performance. Performance — site speed — can have a subtle, yet profound effect on the online experience for your site users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Much has been written on this subject&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-high-cost-of-web-analytics/#fn3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it’s common knowledge that performance matters, but consider one fact: Google has found that a mere 400ms delay in search results can result in a 0.44 percent drop in search volume&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-high-cost-of-web-analytics/#fn4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Given Google is seeing some 2 Trillion searches per year, that 0.44 drop could mean a 9 Billion decrease in searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Site performance matters to your bottom line&lt;/b&gt;, so the impact of a given analytics tool (or a number of tools) on the speed and performance of your site or app can be measured in terms of bouncing users, missed sales, and lower KPIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. The cost of low quality data.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is a big one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What you pay in terms of data quality is a hard to measure — &lt;b&gt;data &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;quality&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; pivots on many factors from basic things like the &lt;b&gt;relevance&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;reliability&lt;/b&gt; of the data to more complex factors including our own &lt;b&gt;cognitive hard-wiring&lt;/b&gt;. Let’s take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Relevance of the data.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Is the data relevant to the problems you’re looking to solve? Is it reliable? Relevance depends on whether the data received helps answer the question at hand. It also depends on timeliness — by the time you get the data, is it still useful for answering your question. Analytics tools that don&amp;#x27;t provide real-time data become immediately less relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There&amp;#x27;s another aspect to &amp;quot;real-time stats,&amp;quot; which is the time it takes to get the data out of the tool. If the data you need isn&amp;#x27;t immediately accessible or extractable for some reason, it can extend the time it takes to get at the information. If it takes too long, will it still make a difference to your decisions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is why Google is a relevance machine: you ask the search engine a question and instantly receive highly relevant search results. Decisions are easier to make when analytics come in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reliability of the data.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The metrics provided by a given analytics tool have a strong-yet-subtle effect on the quality of data because metrics have &lt;i&gt;built-in assumptions that frame your understanding&lt;/i&gt;. Let’s unpack this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» What you see is all there is.&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In Daniel Kahneman’s book &lt;i&gt;Thinking Fast and Slow&lt;/i&gt;, Kahneman shares research that supports the idea that people make decisions using only the basic information available to them — without considering what’s not explicitly known. “What you see is all there is” or “WYSIATI” is a way to remember this source of overconfidence in behavior. As it applies to web analytics, the tendency is to focus on what you know. In that way, the data that analytics tools present becomes authoritative — the singular basis for decisions — and can lead to “jumping to conclusions” without looking for gaps in your information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Framing effects.&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Framing effects take into consideration how the presentation of information effects how that information is interpreted. Consider the following example of a framing effect — ask yourself, which phrasing sounds more positive? More negative? 90% of users ignored the new feature on your website over the first week after launch -&lt;b&gt;VS&lt;/b&gt;- 10% engaged with the new feature in the first week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Framing effects are a major focus of behavioral psychology&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-high-cost-of-web-analytics/#fn5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because how information is framed matters greatly to decisions. On the web, the effect of framing is far-reaching — consider the default “opt-in/out” switch on a sign-up form being flipped “on” instead of “off.” If it’s toggled to the “on,” position, you are all-but-guaranteed to have more people opt-in by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Assumptions.&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Anyone who spends time with data understands that the pretty graph or clean metric comes with a list of assumptions and caveats. As the saying goes, “The devil is in the details.” Meanwhile, given that analysis is conducted to “figure something out,” the person crunching the numbers has the ability to bias the results based on their perspective. In the academic community, Nobel prize winning economist Ronald Coase may have summed up this phenomenon best in saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you torture the data long enough, it will confess.”
— Ronald Coase&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Indeed, if you’ve worked around analysts (or are one!) for any length of time, you will inevitably hear the question, “Well, what do you want the numbers to be?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, settling on a specific metric asserts its validity as a basis for decision-making. You are tied to that metrics&amp;#x27; built-in assumptions. Depending on the metric, this can be a problem. Metrics that aggregate data come with their own set of assumptions. For example, using averages without consideration for the nature of the underlying data can lead to bad decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For web analytics tools, bounce rate is a great example of how an assumed metric frames and limits the way you make decisions. Bounce rate captures what percentage of users land on a page only to leave the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bounce rate, which is simple in theory, is complicated in application. For one, the “framing effect” built-in to bounce rate is that a high bounce rate is “bad.” However, given the number of single-page apps, dynamic pages with infinite scroll, and other common nuances within any given web site or application, bounce rate can be downright irrelevant as a standalone metric. By focusing on bounce rate, you have accepted the assumption that bounce rate as a useful metric on which to base decisions (WYSIATI). But in actuality, “it depends” — as is explicitly discussed in Google Analytic’s support documentation on Bounce Rate&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-high-cost-of-web-analytics/#fn6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Sampling.&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your web analytics tool uses sampling, your data quality will unavoidably take a hit. How confident can you be the sampled data reflects the underlying reality?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to online behavior, edge cases are the rule. Differences in devices (laptops, tablets, mobile devices), browsers, and operating systems, and other factors all combine to make results highly specific to individual users. If a given web analytics tool uses sampling, you have to get comfort on the reliability of those sampling assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data quality matters. &lt;b&gt;The cost of low quality data is making poor decisions that cost you time and money.&lt;/b&gt; “What you see is all there is” means that your analytics tool stack has a pile of answers ready for you, regardless of whether the answers are any good. If those answers are low quality (or unclear in suggesting what you should do), you find you have no choice but to do additional research through that tool or through looking to other analytics tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. The cost of multiple tools.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The perfect, omniscient web analytics tool that has all the answers doesn’t exist (yet!). That means teams must stack together disparate tools in order to fill gaps in their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each tool will be susceptible to the costs detailed above — maintenance, data quality, effects on performance, etc., but in combination, you get the synergistic bonus cost of friction in having to shift across tools, manage multiple subscriptions, understand how to use each tool including knowing which tool is useful and for what, integrate where possible, translate metrics, and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With multiple tools, costs compound and the cross-tool transaction costs add up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. The cost of running analysis.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Last, but certainly not least, is the cost of actually running an analysis using the tool. This cost breaks down into how hard it is to use the tool, whether or not it can be used by decision-makers directly or if you need to hire analysts to do the number crunching. And both of these factors will cost you most in terms of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The ease-of-use of the analytics tool.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Can a decision-maker pick up the tool and immediately extract data — get at an insight? How much training is required to make the tool useful? The more complex the tool, the more friction it puts on getting to data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hiring analysts.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ease-of-use directly affects whether or not decision-makers will need to rely on analysts to crunch the numbers. If the value in a tool requires analysts, you have the obvious cost of extra headcount but the less obvious cost of time—time to requisition an analyst or team to run the report you need to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Time.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Time is money” — so the saying goes. Time has come up before in our analysis as it is a primary driver of data quality. Timeliness is required for data to be relevant. How do you measure the value of time? Answering that would require it’s own analysis; however, a simple heuristic works. The value of information is inversely proportional to to the time it takes to get that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can apply this heuristic to web analytics tools in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time-to-data. &lt;/b&gt;Measured as how long it takes to &lt;i&gt;get at the raw data&lt;/i&gt;, “time-to-data” is affected by the complexity of the tool — setup requirements, ease-of-use, how easy it is to get data out of the tool, etc. If you’ve ever hunted for some obscure information only to find a very useful graph &lt;i&gt;that can’t be exported into a table&lt;/i&gt;, you know the pain of time-to-data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time-to-insights. &lt;/b&gt;Unlike time-to-data, time-to-insights is how long it takes to go from raw data to meaningful, which is to say actionable, information. Analytics tools may have incredible data that is easy to extract, hence low time-to-data, but painfully expensive to turn that data into actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Let’s take an example.&lt;/i&gt; It takes you 20 minutes on average to extract data for a report — that’s your time-to-data. Then, data-in-hand, it takes you two hours to process that data and tease out an insight—that’s your time-t0-insight. Now, repeat that process a few hundred times and if you’re an analyst, factor in the friction of passing on the report only to find that it needs to be re-run for a different time period or some other variable. Time-to-data and time-to-insights add up in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adding up all the costs of your analytics.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s a quick recap of the six buckets to consider when estimating the cost of your web analytics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why go into such detail to estimate the cost of an analytics tool?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because analytical tools are expensive — even if they are “free,” but it’s not at all obvious &lt;i&gt;just how expensive they are&lt;/i&gt;. By analyzing the cost of a given web analytics tool (or stack of tools), you can articulate not only how expensive a given tool is, but also &lt;i&gt;why it’s expensive&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;(And that&amp;#x27;s a very analytical thing to do.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re just adding into your analytics stack yet-another-free-tool — &lt;b&gt;because hey, it’s a free analytics tool, why not?&lt;/b&gt; Remember TANSTAAFL. Will the insights you get out your free tool &lt;i&gt;actually be worth the effort&lt;/i&gt; of installing, maintaining, and paying attention to that tool? Will the &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; data you get out of the tool be high quality, reliable, relevant?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The kitten may be free but caring for that cute fur ball is another thing entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s take one more example—in this case honing on a popular analytics &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; — &lt;b&gt;heatmaps&lt;/b&gt;. Heatmaps are a fun way to visualize aggregated clicks and mouse-tracking on a website—in some cases they even capture attention tracking. The thing is, there are lots of problems with heatmaps that can make them very expensive. Consider there built-in assumptions and the impact those assumptions have on data quality (E.g. how data is aggregated across devices and browsers and how heatmaps deal with dynamic applications).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, heatmaps can also be costly to configure and implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With all that work done (and the assumptions accepted), once you get your heatmap visualizations, you&amp;#x27;re suddenly stuck with the problem of WYSIATI—in this case, your web heatmaps present you with lots of colorful splotches imply &amp;quot;insights.&amp;quot; But are they actually insights?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Learn more &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-are-web-heatmaps-how-do-they-work-pros-cons-alternatives/&quot;&gt;about web heatmaps, how they work, and their built-in assumptions here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The cost of a given analytics tool can add up quick, and as exemplified by heatmaps, the costs aren&amp;#x27;t always obvious (Assumptions, data quality, unclear insights, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How expensive is your web analytics tool?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Henry Ford famously quipped that, &amp;quot;If you need a machine and don’t buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don’t have it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to web analytics tools, costs matter, but no cost is greater than the that of choosing the wrong tool. The easiest way to choose the wrong tool? Only pay attention to the sticker price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need a machine and don’t buy it, then you will ultimately find that you have paid for it and don’t have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Henry Ford&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-high-cost-of-web-analytics/#fn7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And whether it’s through developers spending months implementing and maintaining the tools, stakeholders struggling through aggregated reports that lack clarity or obvious actions, poor decisions made from assumption-loaded data, framing effects that limit how you even understand the information, or any number of other problems examined in this analysis, perhaps the juice isn’t worth the squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Analytics tools only work when they provide reliable, relevant insights &lt;i&gt;that you can act on&lt;/i&gt;. The best analytics tools will be clear and actionable, having low time-to-data and time-to-insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep asking the hard questions about your tools. Run the analysis and discover the real cost of your web analytics stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[9 amazing customer service stories to inspire you]]></title><description><![CDATA[One of the best drivers of customer experience is word-of-mouth.

Whitney Peak Hotel accommodates guest with Nicholas Cage decor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer service doesn&amp;#x27;t always have to be serious. Adding in a dash of humor gives your business a human touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a joke, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliapugachevsky/this-hotel-went-all-out-and-decorated-a-customers-room-with&quot;&gt;Redditor “hlfempty69” requested&lt;/a&gt; in his Whitney Peak Hotel reservation that his room have a Nicholas Cage picture on the pillow. The hotel shared the request on Instagram with the message, “To be continued...”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To the Redditor&amp;#x27;s surprise, the hotel actually followed through on his request. Totally amused, he shared the pics of his hotel experience—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/37s56o/i_requested_a_nic_cage_picture_on_my_pillow_at/&quot;&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The images and story ended up being covered on several major sites, like BuzzFeed and People.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The hotel could&amp;#x27;ve easily ignored the reservation note. Instead, they took it as an opportunity to show the customer they cared about making him happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep humor in your customer service culture, and you&amp;#x27;ll find chances like this to make your customers laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Delta Hotels brightens a bad view&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Social media gives companies a channel that&amp;#x27;s great for proactively delighting customers. While most customers who connect via social media may assume a company is too busy to engage over social media, for the company, being able to learn about customer issues instantly on social media can be an opportunity to create a great customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this story from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140413224601-29200492-a-freaking-awesome-customer-service-story&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, a man named Mike McCready tweeted a picture of his room view at Delta Hotels&amp;#x27; Vancouver Suites. He included the caption, “The inside of my room at the Delta is really nice, but the view, not so much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mike wasn&amp;#x27;t expecting to hear anything, especially since he didn&amp;#x27;t include the Delta Twitter handle in his tweet. But within less than an hour, he received a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Delta wanted to put Mike in a new room. But since he was leaving the next day, Mike told them that switching rooms wouldn&amp;#x27;t make much sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The hotel staff wasn&amp;#x27;t satisfied with leaving it alone. When Mike returned to his room later that day, he found a handwritten note and pastries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mike would probably still have a positive opinion about Delta Hotels without their tweeting or pastries. But he wouldn&amp;#x27;t have raved about the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thus, for the cost of a few pastries, Delta Hotels left a strong impression on a customer with a huge return shared on social media a high return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Spotify hits the right notes with customer playlist&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Personalized service makes customers feel special. When you include a customer&amp;#x27;s name in an email or send them a hand-written birthday card, they feel recognized and appreciated. Those positive feelings become associated with your company and voilà—you have a happy, loyal customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Spotify user &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adweek.com/creativity/spotifys-customer-service-looks-and-sounds-just-about-perfect-151157/&quot;&gt;Jelena Woehr received that individualized touch&lt;/a&gt; after sending the music service some positive feedback in an email. To thank her, a member of the Spotify team created a custom playlist for her. Take a look:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Notice anything about the titles? They spell out a message: &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;Jelena/You Are Awesome/Thanks a Lot/For These Words/It Helps Me/Impress/The Management.&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; Clever!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Woehr was wowed and posted the playlist to Facebook. &amp;quot;Oh my god,&amp;quot; she wrote, &amp;quot;Spotify customer care is ADORABLE.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As Woehr&amp;#x27;s reaction shows, gestures mean more to customers when they are personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Capital One helps a customer in a sticky situation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Giving members of your team the leeway to do random acts of kindness for customers can make someone&amp;#x27;s day and create a buzzworthy customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Last year, as told by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2c3g8i/i_complained_to_capital_one_that_i_couldnt_pay_my/&quot;&gt;this story from Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, a Capital One customer discovered that Apple Magic Keyboards and orange juice do not mix. After the unfortunate spill, the keyboard was fine—mostly. The “2” key didn&amp;#x27;t work. And the numeral 2 was part of his account number with Capital One, which made logging into his online banking account impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The customer figured he could just copy and paste a 2 from somewhere else, but Capital One, like many other financial institutions, restricts what you can copy and paste into secure fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Come to find out, a member of the Capital One support team saw the post on Reddit and decided to send “MaskedKoala” a brand new Magic Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a handwritten note, Janeth and Adam from Capital One explain how the bank thought about sending just the “2” key—but decided to go all out with a brand new keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Showing customer love like this won&amp;#x27;t emerge from any formula of customer happiness. It&amp;#x27;s also difficult to mandate their execution in any way. These moments only happen if you give people the leeway to make them happen. Many of these companies, for example, have budgets set aside just for random acts of customer kindness. If a rep sees an opportunity to make things right for a customer, no matter how insignificant that one case may seem, they can use (up to a certain amount of) petty cash to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Domino&amp;#x27;s saves a regular&amp;#x27;s life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For your really loyal customers (perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/learn-from-power-users-and-improve-your-product/&quot;&gt;your power users&lt;/a&gt;), sometimes all it takes to go above the call of duty is to pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Last year, a Domino&amp;#x27;s in Salem, Oregon noticed when a regular customer, Kirk Alexander, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dominos-pizza-saves-mans-life_us_5732a349e4b096e9f0932e0c&quot;&gt;stopped ordering for two weeks&lt;/a&gt;. According to the restaurant manager Sarah Fuller, Alexander had been ordering at least every other day since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After Alexander hadn&amp;#x27;t ordered for 11 days, Fuller asked a delivery driver to visit Alexander at his home to make sure he was okay. When he arrived, the driver noticed something was off—the lights and TV were on, but Alexander wasn&amp;#x27;t answering. The driver called 911, and the police found Alexander in his home in need of immediate medical attention. He recovered at the hospital, but it&amp;#x27;s unlikely that he would have survived without that Domino&amp;#x27;s branch having checked up on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By taking care and paying attention, they were able to save their customer&amp;#x27;s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. Frontier pilot treats stranded passengers to pizza&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Speaking of pizza, another exceptional customer service experience occurred when a Frontier plane &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/09/frontier-pilot-buys-pizza-stranded-passengers_n_5570493.html&quot;&gt;departed DC for Denver an hour behind schedule&lt;/a&gt;. When it got in the air, bad weather in the Denver area forced the plane to divert and land in Wyoming. At this point, it was 10 PM. Knowing that the 160 passengers were tired and hungry, the pilot decided to order pizza for the entire plane on his own dime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It wasn&amp;#x27;t the pilot&amp;#x27;s fault that the flight was delayed, and he certainly didn&amp;#x27;t need to go out of his way to make these passengers happy and comfortable—delays and diverted landings are part and parcel of flying. Yet by choosing to take responsibility for his customers, what would have been a terrible customer experience became a story of customer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;7. Starbucks barista learns ASL for deaf customer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Great customer service requires you make sure all of your customers feel welcome at your business. And when it comes to accessibility, if you&amp;#x27;re not paying attention you will always leave someone out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ibby Piracha is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2016/02/22/this-starbucks-barista-learned-sign-language-to-communicate-with-her-deaf-customer/?utm_term=.7ffa2f1be595&quot;&gt;a regular&lt;/a&gt; at his local Starbucks in Leesburg, Virginia. Because he is deaf, Piracha usually makes his order by typing it on his phone and showing the barista. He was surprised one day to see his barista use sign language to ask for his order. She handed him a note that said, “I’ve been learning [American Sign Language] just so you can have the same experience as everyone else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Piracha was so shocked that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/MPO.I.Piracha/posts/10208673727024270&quot;&gt;he posted about the experience on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the post has received roughly 27,000 likes and almost 6,000 shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While you can&amp;#x27;t fake that kind of care for your customers, you can hire people who are invested in creating customer serivce experiences. Hire well and eventually, magical moments like this will simply happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;8. Zappos saves the groomsman&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Giving customer service team members the leeway to make customers happy can sometimes be costly. Giving away gifts adds up, no matter the size of the company. However, allowing support employees to give out perks can bring a significant return—lots of customer satisfaction. And when customers see companies go above and beyond, they tend to remember and reward the company with their loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Jay &lt;a href=&quot;https://consumerist.com/2011/05/19/zappos-saves-best-man-from-going-barefoot-at-wedding/&quot;&gt;was the best man in a wedding&lt;/a&gt; and ordered the shoes the groom picked from Zappos. He ordered 3-day shipping to make sure the shoes arrived on time. Unfortunately, his planning was thwarted when his package was sent to the wrong location. It was the day before Jay had to fly to the wedding, and UPS refused to hold the package for him at the shipment center. Desperate, Jay called Zappos to see if they could do something to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Zappos rose to the occasion and overnighted Jay a new pair of shoes, upgraded his account to “VIP” to get free overnight shipping, and gave him a full refund for the shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Jay wrote about his shoe experience saying, “Zappos has earned a customer for life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So even though it was expensive for Zappos, Jay&amp;#x27;s loyalty was likely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;9. Warby Parker exec solves case of missing glasses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When he lost his Warby Parker glasses on an Acela train heading home to Boston, Michael Parker Mathis learned that great customer service doesn&amp;#x27;t stop when you leave the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/stanphelps/2014/08/01/heroic-customer-service-by-a-senior-executive-at-warby-parker/#76f5087e4c9f&quot;&gt;Having lost his glasses, Mathis ordered a new pair almnost immediately&lt;/a&gt;. A few weeks later, Mathis was surprised when received a package that contained two pairs of glasses and a handwritten note:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Michael, This might be odd ... but you sat across from me on the train ride from NYC to Boston a few weeks ago and left your glasses on the train! As luck would have it, I happen to be the GC of Warby Parker, and there is nothing I like more than a good mystery... I hope these find you in good health! (also, we noticed your lenses were scratched so we made you a fresh pair!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, AK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mathis was so impressed that he posted about the experience on Facebook, “They have a customer for life!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Stories like Mathis&amp;#x27; lost Warby Parker glasses are uncommon, but so are the outsized reactions, which is what makes going above and beyond worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Great customer service brings great returns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When companies go above and beyond for their customers, people notice—and are eager to share their experiences with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a simple tweet or a Facebook post, the world can immediately see how a company is making their customers happy.

We spoke to Matt Stein at Metromile, who describes Metromile as &amp;quot;a tech company who is reinventing ways to manage risk&amp;quot; to learn how the team uses FullStory to test and improve unique user flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Much of Metromile&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/customer-experience/&quot;&gt;customer experience&lt;/a&gt; takes place in the desktop interface and the mobile smart driving app. FullStory session replay gives the Metromile team visibility into the user experience, helping Metromile remove any potential points of friction and improve the likelihood customers make it through the flow to purchase car insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Selling Car Insurance Online Requires Personalization at Scale—and a Fine-Gained UX&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Buying car insurance used to require talking to an insurance agent in person or discussing a custom plan on the phone. The benefit of this traditional process was that you got a high-touch personal experience—you talked to an agent who helped you figure out “the right plan for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technology has cut out the middleman in the car insurance industry. Today your first stop in buying car insurance is likely to be a web search. As a result, when you sell car insurance on the Internet, you are selling to a buyer who is noncommittal—they&amp;#x27;re shopping around, Googling, reading reviews, etc. Potential customers can be lost in a click—one tap and they&amp;#x27;re on to the next provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For the company on the other end, this can be a dilemma—without the element of personalization an insurance sales agent provides, potential customers are left to their own devices, navigating complex decision trees, filling out forms, and submitting personal information to receive their quote. Because the process requires so much effort on the consumer end, abandon rates can be high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That&amp;#x27;s why Metromile must understand the precise experience their customers have online—and that&amp;#x27;s where FullStory steps in: to give Metromile a way to find opportunities to make their product more personalized, smarter, and more helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Find Where Users Get Confused Navigating a Novel Web Interface&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One of Metromile&amp;#x27;s core beliefs is that most car owners overpay for car insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A driver&amp;#x27;s number-one accident risk factor is how often they&amp;#x27;re on the road. This just makes sense: low-mileage drivers are less likely to get into accidents than high mileage drivers. However, traditional car insurance quotes don&amp;#x27;t typically account for mileage. Metromile&amp;#x27;s solution is different in that it directly relies on mileage. As a result, low-mileage drivers can get the lowest possible insurance rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The challenge for Metromile is that most people aren&amp;#x27;t used to the pay-per-mile model, which can lead to confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Metromile used FullStory to look for abnormalities in the customer experience with their online Dashboard (E.g. paying attention to session replays containing moments of hesitation, confused clicking, and abandonment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watching these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#what-is-session-replay&quot;&gt;session replays in FullStory&lt;/a&gt;, the Metromile team saw that their system sometimes caused users to hesitate, click aimlessly or leave a quote request unfinished, implying that they were confused by how the flow or process worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using FullStory to help understand the problem, Metromile could provide the right solution to solve it, leading to more conversions, more revenue, and happier customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Metromile solved this problem by creating educational materials on their home page to help users learn how their insurance policies and quote process works, why it is easier to manage than traditional insurance policies and why the pay-per-mile model is better than the traditional billing method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using FullStory to help understand the problem, Metromile could provide the right solution to solve it, leading to more conversions, more revenue, and happier customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Learn From the Ways Users Respond to Test Variants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To make getting a quote quicker and easier, Metromile works constantly to optimize their forms and most recently the team has been experimenting with rate packages. Rate packages bundle together different features and allow users to choose a pre-packaged set of coverage options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Still a work in progress. Metromile is experimenting with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How options are bundled,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to call the packages, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many packages or “levels” to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Metromile team uses the analytics platform &lt;a href=&quot;https://amplitude.com/&quot;&gt;Amplitude&lt;/a&gt; to measure the performance of these variants in A/B testing, and watch session replays to find the points of friction within each variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Specifically, loose integration between FullStory and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.optimizely.com/&quot;&gt;Optimizely&lt;/a&gt; enables the team to set the Optimizely variant ID as a custom variable in FullStory, making it easy to analyze results and get a direct view into way users interact with the different packages they&amp;#x27;re testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watching these sessions helped Metromile find and fix usability issues with some packaging options such as trouble editing a chosen package or finding the right call-to-action (CTA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These UX fixes were quick and simple yet ultimately helped move customers further down the purchase funnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Metromile has also used Optimizely with FullStory to test landing pages and copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Passively Catching Bugs With Session Replay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Metromile has come to rely on FullStory for passively catching bugs that do not get caught before the team&amp;#x27;s weekly updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thankfully, FullStory records all user sessions, serving as a passive bug catcher. Thus, when bugs inevitably occur, the Metromile team is able to reproduce the bugs on demand in FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is always someone on the team looking at FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Matt Stein, Metromile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Matt said that the team has experienced significant benefits from the ability to view problematic sessions so closely, and finding and fixing these bugs. Because of FullStory, his team can provide better overall customer support, which has resulted in a decrease in customer churn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Understand the Impact of Your Product on Your Users&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The nature of Metromile&amp;#x27;s product is that each user will require a unique solution, and a lot has to go right for a customer to convert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory session replay provides Metromile with visibility into what it&amp;#x27;s like for customers to buy their car insurance online, which helps them remove friction, eliminate confusion, and solve bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We&amp;#x27;re thrilled to hear how Metromile uses FullStory to solve bugs, run A/B tests, and understand where users get confused and improve the user experience, and happy to hear that FullStory has become an integral part of the team&amp;#x27;s workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanks Matt and Metromile for sharing!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Teams everywhere &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/use-cases/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;use FullStory to improve the online experience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.

Even when you need a company&amp;#x27;s help, you&amp;#x27;ll typically get customer “service” without ever seeing a face or connecting with someone else in a meaningful way. That&amp;#x27;s why you need to be on the lookout for every moment to put the humans of your company back in front of your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer support is a prime candidate for where to do this. But putting human interaction back into customer service isn&amp;#x27;t always easy. There&amp;#x27;s a delicate and difficult balance to strike between closing support tickets and giving customers a personal touch. Worse, it&amp;#x27;s often hard to get all the information you need in order to give your customers personalized solutions to their issues with your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We&amp;#x27;ve had to confront these problems at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/&quot;&gt;Wistia&lt;/a&gt;, the video marketing company I co-founded 10 years ago. We&amp;#x27;ve found that, by changing to a model of proactive and personal customer service, &lt;b&gt;you can reclaim customer service as a way of making business human again.&lt;/b&gt; This will give your customers a crucial opportunity to see your company as having a culture in which people care deeply about supporting their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Proactively understand your customer&amp;#x27;s problems before they ask for help.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Even if you have the friendliest and most responsive customer support staff in the world, you won&amp;#x27;t be able to effectively help customers if it takes your team forever to figure out what each customer&amp;#x27;s problem really is. For example, a customer might send you a support request about your checkout process. There&amp;#x27;s a lot you&amp;#x27;ll need to figure out before you can identify her exact problem. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What operating system is the customer using?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the customer on mobile or on a desktop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What version of your A/B test is the customer seeing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you don&amp;#x27;t have all the information you need to solve your customer&amp;#x27;s problem, you can either: ask them many more questions in order to identify the exact problem, or direct them to a help page that covers the general topic area of their problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you choose the first option, you&amp;#x27;ll end up demanding a lot more from the customer before you actually solve their problem, and each support request will also take up a lot of your team&amp;#x27;s time. If you choose the second option, your customer might not end up finding the exact solution to their problem, and they&amp;#x27;ll end up feeling alienated from your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We avoided this dilemma by changing how we think about customer service. We used to think about support as a way of helping customers once they came to us with issues. Now, we think of support as something that we &lt;i&gt;constantly&lt;/i&gt; do so that customers can immediately get the help they need when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;We&amp;#x27;re always gathering context on how our customers interact with our site and our products.&lt;/b&gt; We record every customer&amp;#x27;s sessions on our site using FullStory, which lets us know exactly what the customer&amp;#x27;s problem was. We&amp;#x27;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.fullstory.com/integrate-ref/zendesk&quot;&gt;integrated FullStory&amp;#x27;s session replay data with Zendesk&lt;/a&gt; to make it part of our overall customer support suite. Every time a customer submits a support ticket, our Customer Champions can use that ticket to find the session where the customer was using our product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The result is that, through being able to see (through FullStory session replay) what the customer was doing before submitting the ticket, our Customer Champions are able to address customer problems immediately, instead of either guessing at the problem or asking the customer many, many more questions. This frees up the time and resources to give every customer a personal solution to their precise issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Give your customers a direct and personal solution.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s hard to believe, but if you use a personal touch when you help customers, they will appreciate you even more than if there&amp;#x27;d been no problem with your product in the first place! Lots of companies know about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_recovery_paradox&quot;&gt;wild service recovery paradox&lt;/a&gt;, but most try to provide quality customer service by &lt;i&gt;paying&lt;/i&gt; for a better customer experience. Zappos, for example, advertises that they&amp;#x27;ll pay for all shipping costs when you return a pair of shoes to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But you can provide extremely personal and positive customer service without paying for things like free returns&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/using-video-for-personalized-proactive-support/#fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. At Wistia, we try to use video as much as possible in order to make that personal connection between our Customer Champion team and our customers. One-on-one videos show our customers that there is a specific person dedicated to solving their specific issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our Customer Champion Harper got a support request from a customer who was having CSS trouble when embedding his Wistia videos. Instead of pointing a customer to a help page, Harper quickly made up a video using our chrome plugin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wistia.com/soapbox&quot;&gt;Soapbox&lt;/a&gt;, to both engage the customer face-to-face and walk through the solution to his problem on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This kind of personal video fosters a real relationship between our support team and our customers—it makes customers feel like they &lt;i&gt;really should&lt;/i&gt; follow up if they have further problems, which gives them more confidence in using the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once your customer sees that your support staff treats them as part of a community built around your product, you&amp;#x27;ve opened the door for even more dynamic support. At Wistia, we have a Slack channel where customers can communicate with us and each other about everything Wistia. This is part of how we&amp;#x27;ve worked to turn support into a constant mindset, rather than just the closing of support tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get personal about support.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer support is a critical moment where your customers learn about your company and how much it really values helping people succeed with its products. When someone asks you for help, you have a chance to put authentic people in front of them and form a human connection. That&amp;#x27;s what will inspire them to continue trying to succeed with your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you stop thinking of customer support as the mere task of filling tickets, you can re-imagine it as a continuous project of building a community. When you make customer service about personally connecting with your customers, they&amp;#x27;ll be eager to keep using your product, discovering new uses for it and making your company an even bigger part of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[FullStory Helps Education Company Save Over 500 Hours of QA Work]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bug reproduction is time-consuming, and expensive.

GenM an online marketplace that connects student marketers to businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;GenM estimates that 400 million people will enter the workforce over the next decade. Unfortunately, rapid changes in the job market will make it hard for higher education to train this growing workforce. GenM helps solve this problem by shifting job training away from higher education and into the hands of business owners. Marketing is the first niche they are targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;GenM accomplishes this task through creating a marketplace that brings student marketers to businesses in need of marketing work. The resulting digital apprenticeship helps students acquire marketing experience under the mentorship of vetted business owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A screenshot from GenM&amp;#x27;s website. GenM&amp;#x27;s product creates a marketplace that connects students with businesses through a digital apprenticeship. While the service is free for students who receive training and certification, businesses get 120 hours of marketing work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;GenM&amp;#x27;s service is totally free for the students, who receive online courses and are certified in digital marketing from GenM. Businesses pay a small membership fee to access the platform, which includes 120 hours of unpaid marketing work from their apprentice. The resulting relationship is a win-win between students and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;FullStory is the #1 app we use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Moe Abbas, GenM CEO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to FullStory, Moe shares with us that, &lt;b&gt;&amp;quot;FullStory is the #1 app we use&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; to fix bugs fast, understand the customer journey, and provide delightful customer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;GenM finds and fixes bugs, optimizes conversions, creates delightful customer experiences—with FullStory.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;FullStory use-case by Moe Abbas, GenM CEO and Co-Founder.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory is the #1 app we use at GenM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It allows us to find problems in the user experience, trace the customer path to paying businesses, find users who are abusing our system, verify the truth on all customer complaints, and from an engineering perspective it allow us to QA bugs, which is notoriously difficult to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On saving 500+ hours of QA by catching and reproducing bugs.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What I love most about FullStory is the ability to catch bugs. Many times founders are left in the dark about why their product is not working the way it&amp;#x27;s supposed to. On many occasions when we thought that no one wanted to use our product, we discovered that in reality they could not use our product because of an issue they were experiencing that we could not replicate in our internal testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before FullStory, we would spend hours and hours trying to replicate bugs. A user would give us a vague problem they had and we would guesstimate the cause. Often this involved many back and forth emails. Often it took days. Often we could not replicate the bug. Often the user had trouble describing it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With FullStory the first thing we do is review the user&amp;#x27;s session. Instead of guessing and struggling to interpret what the user is saying, we see it ourselves. This insight has allowed us to find bugs in minutes instead of days. &lt;b&gt;Over the last year our QA time has been cut from 15 hours a week to 1-2 hours a week—FullStory has saved us over 500 man hours of QA that we would have normally done.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Iterate on funnels, understand the customer journey.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;My second favourite thing is tracing the customer journey to a paying user. Understanding what a user did before they paid us allows us to iterate on our funnels. This unique insight has significantly increased our revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, before customers pay, we ask them to share in order to receive a $45 savings. We had paying users, and users who shared, so there was no real flag that we had a problem—until we were casually reviewing the journeys of our business signups through FullStory and noticed customers were getting errors. This was really easy to solve, and once solved our conversions increased by 8%. Without FullStory we would never have discovered the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another example is once a user completes their profiles, they would leave our platform. Looking at raw data would not tell us why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What was happening was the users did not have a trigger as to what to do next. They would hover around their profiles, navigate to a few pages, and then leave. Here&amp;#x27;s what users saw on completing their profiles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We decided to create a much clearer CTA to funnel users to the next step. Now, 80% of members are moving on to the details page, which is leading to higher conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;80% of members are moving on to the details page, which is leading to higher conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Moe Abbas, GenM CEO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Providing a delightful customer experience.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;My third favourite is delighting our customers. When a customer complains about a problem and we respond with high fidelity details on their experience and solution it blows their mind. It makes our small company seem like we have magic powers to know exactly what the user did when they had an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This magic power has converted frustrated customers into evangelists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GenM model appears to be an innovative solution to help students begin their marketing careers.

The lever that amplifies the power of FullStory is how it helps you find the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; sessions to replay, research, analyze, and put to work—for anything from bug reproduction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/how-to-use-session-replay-for-conversion-rate-optimization/&quot;&gt;conversion rate optimization&lt;/a&gt;—and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-is-session-replay-useful-for/&quot;&gt;so much more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do you put the power of Search to work? You search. More specifically, you create Segments of sessions based on user and event filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The basics » FullStory Segments.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before we get to your own custom Segments, let&amp;#x27;s start with the basics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Straight out of the box, FullStory gives you a handful of default Segments. You&amp;#x27;ll find these in the lefthand column when you launch the FullStory App. The default Segments in FullStory are, themselves, searches you can create separately. They include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everyone &lt;/b&gt;— self-explanatory. This is everything!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Signed-up &lt;/b&gt;— this segment works with FS.identify and is used to &lt;b&gt;filter out anonymous users &lt;/b&gt;from your list of sessions. The corresponding search is a &lt;i&gt;User Filter &lt;/i&gt;based on &lt;code&gt;Signed-up status &lt;/code&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;is signed up &lt;/code&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624794&quot;&gt;KB article&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New this week &lt;/b&gt;— all sessions where the user was &lt;code&gt;First seen &lt;/code&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;is in the last &lt;/code&gt;7 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rage clicked recently &lt;/b&gt;— sessions in the past week that contain. This Segment uses an &lt;i&gt;Event Filter &lt;/i&gt;of &lt;code&gt;Has Rage clicks On Anything&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mobile &lt;/b&gt;— Look at sessions coming from Mobile devices. This Segment is based on an &lt;i&gt;Event Filter&lt;/i&gt;-based search: &lt;code&gt;Has &lt;/code&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Any activity &lt;/code&gt;when the &lt;code&gt;Device was Mobile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you can see, &lt;b&gt;FullStory&amp;#x27;s default Segments are constructed based on specific Search criteria.&lt;/b&gt; In other words, Segments in FullStory are powered by Search—whatever &lt;i&gt;Event Filters&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;User Filters&lt;/i&gt; you desire, which means these default Segments are capable of being modified by additional Search criteria, however you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Or you can roll your own Segments from scratch using the &lt;i&gt;User&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Event Filters&lt;/i&gt; in the default Segments—mixed and matched with hundreds of other &lt;i&gt;User&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Event Filters&lt;/i&gt;. The limits are really your own imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Building custom Segments in FullStory.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that you get a sense for how Search and Segments work, you can &lt;b&gt;start creating your own custom Segments in FullStory based on whatever criteria you want&lt;/b&gt;—or use additional criteria to refine results from the default Segments (.e.g. start with Signed-up and then modify the search further).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Segments in FullStory are built based on what it is you want to find out about your users or customers. The possibilities are near limitless&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/#fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;—a powerful realization that can also be overwhelming. Where do you begin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It depends on what you want to do. If you&amp;#x27;re an ecommerce site, you might be curious about users who clicked on the &lt;code&gt;Add to cart&lt;/code&gt; button. Try typing in the Search field atop your list of sessions in FullStory &lt;code&gt;Add to cart&lt;/code&gt;. FullStory will begin auto-completing your query, if possible. Alternatively, you can filter your sessions based on who visited a particular page, clicked a specific CSS selector, clicked specific text, and many, many other things (too many to list).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Give auto-complete a try and see if it doesn&amp;#x27;t get you started. Alternatively, clicking on the Search field in FullStory will dropdown a menu of things you can search on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Even here the list isn&amp;#x27;t comprehensive as there are other modifiers you can use to refine your results even further. One of the most powerful ways to search your sessions is based on the &lt;code&gt;Has&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;Any activity&lt;/code&gt; search modifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using this &lt;i&gt;Event Filter&lt;/i&gt; you can search based on all sorts of things like location, browser, Referer URL, Console Errors on Page, and more:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can deploy the above modifiers on other types of &lt;i&gt;Event Filters&lt;/i&gt;, too. Whenever you see the &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; at the end of a search, tap it and get going, and as you see in the example above, you can add a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of modifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The possibilities are near-limitless. Play around and see what you can create!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t forget to save those Segments.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you&amp;#x27;ve created a great Segment in FullStory, &lt;b&gt;save it&lt;/b&gt;. Click the button to &amp;quot;Save Segment&amp;quot;, give it a name, and it&amp;#x27;ll appear in the lefthand menu under &amp;quot;My Segments&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Other team members will also see these Segments (and you&amp;#x27;ll see theirs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can modify your Segment further once you&amp;#x27;ve saved it and named it. If you make a modification and want to update the saved Segment, simply click &amp;quot;Save.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Create copies, duplicate Segments&lt;/i&gt; — Sometimes you might want to build off an existing Segment. For that, navigate over to &amp;quot;Segment options&amp;quot; at the top right and you&amp;#x27;ll find the option to &amp;quot;Duplicate Segment&amp;quot; (as well as other options). Use this to create copies without overwriting your existing Segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use Search and Segments to get the most out of FullStory.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;d like to get started building Segments but don&amp;#x27;t know where to start, hop over to the blog posts below and see if you can&amp;#x27;t pick up a few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-fastest-funnels-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;The Fastest Funnels on the Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/find-the-thing-you-see-create-searches-directly-from-playback-with-inspect-mode/&quot;&gt;Find the Thing You See: Create Searches Directly from Playback with Inspect Mode &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/search-bounce-rate-form-abandonment-feature-adoption-javascript-errors/&quot;&gt;5 FullStory Searches You Should Be Using&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/6-custom-segments-for-saas-y-fullstorians/&quot;&gt;6 Custom Segments for SaaS-y FullStorians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;log in to FullStory&lt;/a&gt; and start searching and building Segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Original post, October 2, 2014 »&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;At long last, today we are thrilled to bring Segments to FullStory. As you may have discovered, FullStory’s search-everything approach has been a super-powerful way to quickly gather usage metrics and identify interesting sessions. (Note: if you haven’t played with search yet, click the magnifying glass in the upper-right of FullStory and hold onto your hat.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unfortunately, up until today, once you built a specific search query there was nowhere to save it. Well, we’ve fixed all that!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;In FullStory’s main nav you’ll see a new top-level item named Segments. There you’ll have one-click access to the groups of users you and your team are most interested in understanding. And you’ll notice that we’ve included a few segments to get you started:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Signed-up users&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;. This segment shows you — yep, you guessed it — all of your signed-up customers (that have appeared since you installed the script). And yes, this segment exposes for the first time a much-requested search criterion that allows you to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;filter out anonymous users&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;. Rejoice!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;30-day actives. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;This segment is built upon a common metric to help you keep tabs on your most engaged logged-in users.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;New users this week&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;. See how people interact with your website for the very first time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mobile users. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Watch the unique patterns and behaviors customers take when on a mobile device.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Go build your own!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Defining a segment is super simple. With Search open in FullStory you’ll notice a button labeled “Save as Segment”. Click it when you’ve narrowed your list of users to the desired set. For example, this morning I created a segment named “People who discovered Segments” to give the team quick access to watch and understand how you guys are engaging with the new feature (so far so good).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lastly, there is a Team Segments area, where you can explore the segments created by your teammates. Also, segment URLs are sharable with other FullStory users.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of course, this release is only the first step of a big arc of work for us. We can’t wait to show you more of the FullStory. But in the meantime, please don’t stop sending us your valuable feedback. Thank you!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Go try Segments now ›&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google indicates that &lt;a href=&quot;https://searchengineland.com/google-reaffirms-15-searches-new-never-searched-273786&quot;&gt;15% of searches they receive have never been seen before&lt;/a&gt;. With FullStory, we don&amp;#x27;t have a specific percentage of Searches never been seen before because it&amp;#x27;s pretty much all of them, with the exceptions of the &amp;quot;default&amp;quot; Segments enumerated above. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/#fnref1&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lessons from Google: How code reviews build company culture]]></title><description><![CDATA[What are code reviews, and why are they important to FullStory's culture?

Perhaps the most important foundational tenet at the big G is a practice called code reviews, or, more precisely, “pre-commit” code reviews. We continue the practice at FullStory and hold it as sacrosanct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Although much has been written about the benefits of code reviews, it isn’t yet a ubiquitous practice in the world of software development. But it should be, particularly for large engineering teams or teams with a flat management structure, e.g. no project managers or supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Contained herein are both the big, obvious engineering reasons you should adopt code reviews, as well as the more nuanced — but equally important — benefits to your customers and your own company culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do code reviews work at FullStory?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While working on a new feature, Dave (for example) will cut a branch from the current version of our master product and work exclusively on that branch, a process with which I’m sure most of the coding world is intimately familiar. But before he can reintegrate the changes into master, Pratik or another qualified engineer must review his work and give him the stamp of approval:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;LGTM&lt;/b&gt; (Looks Good To Me)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If Pratik has an issue with the way Dave has designed or coded the work, they’ll have a discussion (potentially with a long volley of back-and-forth reasoning) until they reach an agreement. Or, if Pratik has no issues, he can LGTM the work right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most software engineers would vouch for the research showing that problems found early — during design or coding — can be fixed many times faster than when they’re found later in production. (I’ve copied the relevant data below, but you can read more about the impacts of inadequate testing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nist.gov/director/planning/upload/report02-3.pdf&quot;&gt;this tome from NIST&lt;/a&gt; [PDF], if you dare.) In layman’s terms, catching bugs earlier on makes them faster and easier to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And that’s to say nothing of the ill will avoided by not exposing your customers to buggy features in the first place. Taking a few extra moments to perfect code before pushing it to production spares time spent fixing it later, but more importantly, it spares your customers from developing a negative perception of your product and your capabilities as a development team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What kinds of problems do code reviews prevent? They sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/capture-bugs-like-fireflies-in-a-jar-with-fullstory-for-jira/&quot;&gt;catch bugs&lt;/a&gt;, yes, but there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/?id=242201&quot;&gt;mixed reports&lt;/a&gt; of how reliably that works. In fact, static analysis tools and unit tests are much better than reviews at ratcheting up and maintaining correctness in individual pieces of code over time. But the role of code reviews at FullStory goes much deeper than that anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5 intangible benefits of code reviews — a bionic cultural hammer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve found that the most powerful benefits of code review are the subtlest to measure and describe. Code reviews have many important side effects — arguably, primary effects — that we discovered at Google and have continued to evolve at FullStory. For us, the practice of code reviews is a “bionic cultural hammer.” It’s a “cultural hammer” because it’s a tool that strongly shapes the way we work, and it’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/more-than-human-but-not-machine/&quot;&gt;bionic&lt;/a&gt;” because it is more powerfully self-perpetuating than any passive “coding standards policy” could ever be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The following 5 intangibles may not be able to be plotted on a chart, but are no less, possibly more, important than simply catching bugs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Code reviews promote openness&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Code reviews set the tone for the entire company that everything we do should be open to scrutiny from others, and that such scrutiny should be a welcome part of your workflow rather than viewed as threatening. It’s natural to feel threatened by critique, so you have to hold it as a sacrosanct practice to maintain the right mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No discipline at FullStory is free from critique. Our designers, as we’ve discussed, regularly have their progress checked by other designers and non-designers alike. The marketing and hugging teams review each other’s work before publishing (a practice which can be referred to as “flavor policing” if our storytellers produce something especially bizarre). Everything at FullStory, even the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/suck-less-cycle/#step1dogma&quot;&gt;dogma to which we subscribe&lt;/a&gt;, is open to being challenged by anyone, to maintain agility, freshness, and the openness necessary to learn and grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Code reviews raise team standards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Aside from promoting psychic flexibility, code reviews also help prevent &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-broken-window-theory/&quot;&gt;the broken window effect&lt;/a&gt; by making sure all of our engineers share a similarly high set of standards. The mere act of saying explicitly to ourselves that we have very high standards perpetuates a virtuous cycle. People begin to want to honor our high bar of quality for its own sake, not merely to “get past the reviewer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Upholding the culture of code reviews becomes a mantle each of us proudly and voluntarily advances. Putting a well-crafted piece of code in front of your reviewer in the first place becomes more important than earning an eventual LGTM. Showing yourself to be “the most receptive” to even the most deflating critique is a badge of honor. Perfecting your tone as a reviewer so that you can deliver even harsh feedback in a respectful and palatable manner is a celebrated skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Code reviews propel teamwork&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The act of reconciling different viewpoints between reviewer and reviewee can sometimes be a challenge. Opinions are often subjective (e.g. “I just don’t like how you’ve done this,” to which one might respond, “Yeah, well, I do like how I’ve done this”), and the reviewer might be making a good judgment call… or might just be obstructionist without quite realizing it. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/see-beyond-the-average/&quot;&gt;Humans are complicated&lt;/a&gt;, amirite?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, how do people resolve those kinds of divergent perspectives? Becoming good at this activity is the essence of functioning effectively as an egalitarian team. You shouldn’t need or want a manager acting as an “adult” to come in and break a stalemate; you should want everyone in your company to have the conflict resolution skills to work through such situations rationally. Code reviews are neverending practice of your dispute resolution skills, which usefully spill over into many other areas of work life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Code reviews keep security top-of-mind&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How might code reviews affect the security of your application? Even if we assume that automated tools (e.g. vulnerability scanning) find individual security problems more reliably than code reviews, there’s much more to the story. Let’s talk at the “meta” level. What message does it send to every engineer that, upon every single change, their code will be reviewed for security problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First, it keeps security top-of-mind as code is being designed and written. The high team standards mentioned earlier make every engineer want to not only pass a code review, but genuinely impress the reviewer with their code’s quality, making it far less likely that security considerations would be forgotten or overlooked. It’s very embarrassing to fail to sanitize data and invite cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Second, maintaining great security means keeping track of myriad evolving technicalities, and code reviews can be an effective way for engineers to train each other continuously and organically. If Jaime learns about a new exploit on Hacker News this morning, he can look for it in the code reviews he does this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Contrast this with sending engineers to a security training seminar. It has some value, sure. But it sounds better on paper than it is in reality, because:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;when you learn things out of context in a classroom, you don’t learn them nearly as well as in a contextual, hands-on scenario that you care about: your own code, for example, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;one-time training, to the extent that your team manages to retain anything they learn, becomes stale very, very quickly in the technology world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Code reviews, instead, require both reviewers and reviewees to constantly update their security knowledge and to practice it in the most relevant context possible: inside the implementation of the product itself. Security is thus never treated as “a thing apart,” and security implications are a fundamental aspect of every change we make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Code reviews frame social recognition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One surprising downside of an egalitarian team culture is that you don’t really have a boss to pat you on the back and publicize your accomplishments. Here, again, code reviews are a bionic cultural hammer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Only qualified reviewers can LGTM someone’s branch; no one may begin their journey at this advanced position of trust. You have to schedule a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/prove-its/&quot;&gt;Prove It&lt;/a&gt; (an internal name for meetings where the host must defend or prove their thesis of some sort) to convince existing reviewers to agree that you’re ready to become a trusted reviewer yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is no popularity contest; we use clear criteria as a backstop, and evidence of knowledge and skill are hard requirements. Becoming a code reviewer thus becomes a flattering rite of passage, the very existence of which reiterates to every person at your company that your processes reflect your emphasis on quality, security, performance, and every other value you wish to advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We shape our culture because it shapes us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite plenty of software tools that can automatically find many bugs and security problems in our code, why do we choose to spend so much time reviewing every ... single ... change? And what does any of this have to do with FullStory’s mission to help teams deliver a perfect online customer experience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We believe that our adherence to code reviews helps us rehearse our cultural priorities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have high standards (especially with respect to security),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be open to being wrong on any topic, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember to contextualize our individual goals in terms of how it affects our teammates, company, and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These tenets feel like the cultural ingredients of quality code, happier colleagues, and a better experience for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But do high standards around code result in better products?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You might be wondering if all this effort around reviewing code pays off when it counts: building better software. It&amp;#x27;s a valid question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Well, our customers tell us how much they love FullStory, and we see that as a strong signal of success. But even so, applying high standards to our code won&amp;#x27;t prevent all bugs. So when unexpected software errors inevitably &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; make their way into our product, we turn to FullStory and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/debugging-with-session-replay/&quot;&gt;use session replay as a debugging tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;(So if you like quality products and want to build better software, you might want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fullstory.com/platform&quot;&gt;check FullStory session replay&lt;/a&gt; out.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you end up putting code reviews to work—or use some similar process—we&amp;#x27;d like to hear about it in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 7 causes of bad user experiences]]></title><description><![CDATA[What bad web design drives frustrating user experiences?

It&amp;#x27;s simple. You&amp;#x27;re going about your business online and trying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/&quot;&gt;get some job done&lt;/a&gt;—learn about a topic, buy something, do some work. There&amp;#x27;s just one problem. You just can&amp;#x27;t ... &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; ... &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;do it&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. The site (or app) is too slow, too complicated, confusing, roadblocked, &lt;i&gt;whatever&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These moments make up the building blocks of frustration. And if your livelihood depends on the web, you know it doesn&amp;#x27;t take much struggle during these critical moments for your users to disappear. The internet puts competitors a mere click, tap, or search away. That&amp;#x27;s why understanding, identifying, and eliminating the causes of user frustration online is critical for success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 7 biggest causes of online frustration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What are the most common causes of bad online experiences? If we can name the most notorious offenders of frustration, perhaps creating a &amp;quot;Most Wanted&amp;quot; list of bad UX, we can—maybe!—avoid these sneaky villains entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To that end, here are the seven biggest frustration culprits. To that end, we list the 7 biggest causes of frustration online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Clunky, dysfunctional, dated, or just &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; site or app design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;All the stuff presented on your site or app has the potential to delight, help, confuse, or frustrate customers. Below are listed a few of the most egregious ways to frustrate customers with design, UI/UX, or “stuff” you put on your site or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eye-catching, whizbang look-at-me elements. &lt;/b&gt;See animated GIFs in the mid-90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Auto-play video&lt;/b&gt; (or music). &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com/opinion/2016/08/26/autoplay-video-is-a-plague-that-cant-be-stopped/&quot;&gt;Not a good idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Omitting common navigation elements &lt;/b&gt;e.g., &amp;quot;Where is [Search | Login | Support | Contact | some other basic thing]?&amp;quot; The flipside of this is having &lt;i&gt;too much navigation&lt;/i&gt;, or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Too clever navigation&lt;/b&gt;—i.e., using clever words for common navigation elements.

Every web page has a default call to action—it’s that X to close the browser tab. Check out these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.disruptiveadvertising.com/conversion-rate-optimization/5-places-youre-forgetting-to-put-a-call-to-action/&quot;&gt;5 spots the CTA goes MIA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Performance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Is your site or app slow to load? In &lt;b&gt;2010&lt;/b&gt;, a page viewed on a computer that took 4 seconds to load would see a 30% decrease in page views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fast forward to &lt;b&gt;2012&lt;/b&gt;, and that same 4 second page load would drop your page views by 40%. Jump to 2016, and 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load[1].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s &lt;b&gt;2018&lt;/b&gt;—what do you think the impact of slow-loading sites is now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, nobody has time for anything. Everyone is impatient. Attention is scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Site or app performance is table stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Aggressive tactics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While only some of the tactics below are downright shady, all are pushy enough to test the limits of your users&amp;#x27; patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pop-ups, pop-unders, lightbox overlays, etc.&lt;/b&gt; How fast can you find and click the “X”?

Perhaps the most egregious offender that still gets a lot of playtime is the CTA to &amp;quot;sign-up for our newsletter&amp;quot; lightbox overlay—triggered on the first visit to a site after a handful of seconds. Or triggered right when you&amp;#x27;ve shown intent to leave, which usually backfires and simply emboldens users to bounce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ads!&lt;/b&gt; In particular, the ones that take over the entire screen, mandate you watch them, autoplay sound, and on and on. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/content/images/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-17-at-4.18.48-PM.png&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s looking at you, Forbes&lt;/a&gt;!

While advertisements may be a required revenue stream and the more in-your-face the ads are, the more likely they are to be seen, clicked, and valued, there&amp;#x27;s a tenuous balance, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/technology/ad-blocking-internet.html&quot;&gt;the rise in ad-blocking software&lt;/a&gt; is a solid indicator that many advertisers and publishers are taking ads too far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, advertisements with clickbait thumbnails or titles create cognitive load for your users, who must tease out if the &amp;quot;article&amp;quot; is real or an ad. That&amp;#x27;s not fun. Associating your brand with clickbait should likely be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opt-in boxes, automatically checked. &lt;/b&gt;Automatically being opted-in to marketing materials may increase sign-ups, but they can also infuriate your users. Tread lightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which one/where&amp;#x27;s the download button? &lt;/b&gt;While this should go without saying, attempting to trick users into clicking the wrong button sows distrust, at best. If ad placements on your site sit near critical buttons, consider how those advertisements may mislead your users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Show notifications.&lt;/b&gt; Who could have guessed the ability to allow websites to notify you through the browser would be abused? It&amp;#x27;s now common practice to arrive at a random website for the first time and have to tell it that, no, you don&amp;#x27;t want it to notify you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. It’s broken&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your website or application isn&amp;#x27;t working, it&amp;#x27;s highly likely your users are going to notice. Granted, the site or application may not be working for lots of reasons. Here are just a couple:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;User error. &lt;/b&gt;Sometimes users can’t seem to figure out how to use your site or app so that it functions properly. Like it or not, they are going to blame your product for the failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bugs. &lt;/b&gt;Some part of the site is broken. Perhaps it’s a JavaScript error. Perhaps a missing page. It&amp;#x27;s hard to say unless you do some forensics on your site (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#reproduce-solve-bugs-faster&quot;&gt;FullStory is built to help solve bugs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. It&amp;#x27;s taking too long to do [x]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to web design, it&amp;#x27;s easy to turn a simple task into something overly complex or tedious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is similar in nature to performance: if users feel the process to reach a certain page on your site (or point of conversion) is too slow, they will quickly become frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Filling out forms or navigating the checkout process are two trouble areas that can rapidly turn into a bad user experience. Consider that roughly 70% of consumers will abandon their shopping cart with over 1 in 4 citing the checkout process was &amp;quot;too long/complicated&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/7-causes-of-bad-user-experiences/#fn2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[2].&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. I’m confused and/or I have no idea what I’m doing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ever interact with a site/app and feel like you should be able to do something obvious, but you just can&amp;#x27;t figure out how to do it? UI confusion is a major cause of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most users will just leave with only a select few making it over to the Help documents. An even smaller number will actually reach out for support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;7. My device is broken and/or my Internet connection stinks, etc.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We&amp;#x27;ve all been there: a slow (or missing) Internet connection; a lagging, uncooperative device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The kicker about this one is that it doesn&amp;#x27;t have to be your site&amp;#x27;s fault for your site (or app) to take the blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One solution, though not an easy one, is to prepare the responsive design of your site for users who might have poor Internet connections. Google, for example, encourages employees to test out their products over slower Internet speeds by mimicking 3G (and other) connection speeds as options across the Google corporate Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are no perfect solutions—if any exist, at all—for this one. You will need to get creative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bonus! Moving elements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This one is too good—and too pervasive across our categories—not to give it explicit mention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Have you ever gone to click something only to—at the last instance—have that element move due to some later-loading advertisment or other site elememt? It&amp;#x27;s instantly enraging, and a terribly common problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/ways-to-reduce-content-shifting-on-page-load/&quot;&gt;Whole articles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/content-jumping-avoid/&quot;&gt;have been written&lt;/a&gt; about solving this problem. Suffice to say, when users lose trust in your site to behave predictably when they tap or click, how can you expect them to click or tap when it counts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3 steps to go from bad UX to building a better web&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Awareness is only the first step to reducing frustration online—it lacks teeth until you put your knowledge to work, so &lt;i&gt;take action.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spread the word: Share this post! &lt;/b&gt;You are a bad ux &amp;#x27;pert, but are your co-workers?

Despite the names, each serves a vastly different purpose within the software development lifecycle (&amp;quot;SDLC&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s define them both, compare the two, and look at which solution will make the most sense for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is Record and Playback?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Record and Playback is a common feature for automated user interface (UI) testing. With a Record and Playback tool, you can hit “record” and begin clicking on elements within a user interface on a website or web app. The Record and Playback tool will record your interactions so that later you can hit “play.” The tool will then recreate your interactions—every navigation, click, or keystroke–in the browser, exactly as if you performed them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These scripted interactions can then be manually kicked off to run later as needed. As the automated test runs, it will return error messages if the automated testing tool fails to complete one of the interactions as programmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Understood through &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/&quot;&gt;the Jobs-to-Be-Done framework&lt;/a&gt; (JTBD), automated UI testing via record and playback does the job of repeating manual interactions as a check to make sure key functionality works as designed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These test scripts can also be integrated with other systems to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run on &lt;i&gt;command &lt;/i&gt;as part of a QA process
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run on &lt;i&gt;demand &lt;/i&gt;as part of the build process, to prevent broken code from shipping to production (this is typically referred to as &amp;quot;automated testing within continuous integration / continuous delivery&amp;quot;), or
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run on a &lt;i&gt;schedule &lt;/i&gt;from remote machines to monitor performance of a site or web application proactively, watching speed and reliability (this is typically called &amp;quot;synthetic monitoring&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;transaction monitoring&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What are some Record and Playback tools?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Common record and playback tools include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/&quot;&gt;Selenium IDE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.katalon.com/&quot;&gt;Katalon Automation Recorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.testing-whiz.com/&quot;&gt;TestingWhiz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smartbear.com/product/testcomplete/overview/&quot;&gt;TestComplete by SmartBear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Benefits and trade-offs: Record &amp;amp; Playback tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Record and Playback tools can be helpful for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing manual work in QA and regression testing,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing usability or performance bugs from going live, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quickly creating highly portable tests for ongoing performance monitoring&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are some trade-offs to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recorded tests are limited. You can write transaction tests to run common user flows, but it would take a whole lot of recorded tests to get full coverage of every possible click path.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recorded tests are fragile. Because the recorded test scripts often rely on specific CSS or XPATH to reference the correct elements with which to interact, minor changes to a site&amp;#x27;s code could cause the tests to fail when they run. Scripts must be actively and carefully maintained to reflect any changes to a site&amp;#x27;s navigation or user interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s worth noting that some Record and Playback tools &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; work in designated browsers. If you&amp;#x27;re looking to import your recorded tests into a suite for ongoing monitoring, you&amp;#x27;ll need to make sure that the script output from your Record and Playback tool is compatible with your monitoring service. (For example, some synthetic monitoring solutions will accept Selenium IDE tests but not Java-based Selenium tests; it&amp;#x27;s important to know the difference!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is Session Replay?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session replay tools help you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/session-replay-customer-support/&quot;&gt;Get context on problems to support customers effectively&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/proactive-support/&quot;&gt;proactively&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/debugging-with-session-replay/&quot;&gt;Reproduce errors and debug efficiently&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#understand-user-experience-ux-research&quot;&gt;Understand UX on your site or application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/session-replay-conversion-rate-optimization/&quot;&gt;A/B test, experiment, and optimize for conversions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#what-is-session-replay-useful-for&quot;&gt;Many other things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bonus:&lt;/i&gt; If you have a session replay tool that captures all user interactions  and surfaces errors errors, you basically have 100% coverage for monitoring all of the performance problems with your live site. And, you&amp;#x27;ll never have to wonder how to replicate a bug, because you&amp;#x27;ll have the interaction and console errors logged in one place. That&amp;#x27;s super valuable!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are some limitations of session replay tools to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Session replay helps you react quickly to bugs, but it might not help you prevent bugs. It is possible to use session replay on a staging environment to record errors as they occur, and it&amp;#x27;s super helpful to use session replay to QA on production or live sites, but most session replay tools won&amp;#x27;t integrate nicely into your build process to prevent those bugs from going live in the first place. That said - the beauty of replay is that every bug will be  captured as it occurs, and sessions with captured bugs can help you respond quickly and keep your time-to-resolution low (fast).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some light maintenance may be required. While session replay itself doesn&amp;#x27;t come with the limitations and fragility of automated test scripts (everyday updates and changes to your website won&amp;#x27;t break recording) you might not completely escape the light maintenance work that comes with site updates. While recording itself might not require any instrumentation, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;reports or Segments&lt;/a&gt; that make session replay so valuable can require some ongoing attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Is session replay right for you?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s break it down:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;☞ Looking for a tool to help you record interactions to create scripts for automated testing?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nope—session replay isn&amp;#x27;t the thing to solve that problem. But if you Google &amp;quot;automated UI testing,&amp;quot; you&amp;#x27;ll probably come up with something useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;☞ Need answers about your customer experience to make critical business decisions? Want to support customers with less back-and-forth, save time spent debugging, and optimize your site or web application?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yes—session replay is the tool for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But why not both?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For most organizations, it probably makes sense to have both record/playback and session replay tools in their SDLC tool kits. These tools can be complementary. In fact, session replay can be powerful for informing which user flows will be most valuable to record and automate for proactive monitoring or testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, through watching session replays, you might uncover a popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/customer-journey-maps-session-replay-and-the-power-of-empathy/&quot;&gt;customer journey&lt;/a&gt; on your website that you wouldn&amp;#x27;t have known was business-critical. Once you know how many of your customers rely on that path or set of features, you can use record and playback to build a test specifically for that critical customer flow and make sure that it never breaks when you deploy new code.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stay ahead of ecommerce trends in 2021 by focusing on digital experience]]></title><description><![CDATA[A look at some of this year's biggest challenges for ecommerce companies and how offering an excellent digital experience can help overcome them. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/ecommerce-trends-2021</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/ecommerce-trends-2021</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article summary&lt;/b&gt;: In this post, we look at some of the biggest challenges facing ecommerce companies this year and how offering an excellent digital experience can help them overcome those challenges. All data presented here is from FullStory&amp;#x27;s original research, &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;The State of Digital Experience 2020: Mapping a Path to Digital Experience Maturity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The global pandemic prompted dramatic changes worldwide. Among those changes: enormous growth in ecommerce. As in-person shopping became difficult or even impossible, people turned to online channels to conduct more of their buying. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2020/04/29/online-sales-jump-49-bopis-grows-208-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;According to Adobe Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. online sales in April 2020 increased 49 percent over the year prior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A survey &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-consumers-shopping-more-online-don-t-expect-to-revert-to-pre-pandemic-behavior?ecid=nl1014https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-consumers-shopping-more-online-don-t-expect-to-revert-to-pre-pandemic-behavior?ecid=nl1014&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conducted by eMarketer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; similarly found nearly half of consumers shifted their spending toward online channels across all categories—from grocery to apparel to electronics—during the first months of the pandemic. “Online orders are seeing two to three times year-on-year growth, with some retailers seeing increases of more than 20 times,” the survey found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While some predict these changes are only temporary while the pandemic and stay-at-home orders persist, research has found these changes could instead indicate the future of ecommerce. According to eMarketer, “Even as stores reopen and brick-and-mortar sales rebound, we forecast that ecommerce will lose just a 0.1% share of total retail sales in 2021, before gaining more than 1 percentage point each year through 2024.” Whether ecommerce continues strong growth once the pandemic has passed or not is still to be seen, but what we do know is the recent boom in ecommerce created another notable shift: The ecommerce landscape has become vastly more competitive. According to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/the-future-of-ecommerce/omnichannel&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;report from Shopify&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “record ecommerce competition—fueled by legacy wholesalers, global retail giants, and product categories not traditionally purchased online—is increasing and driving up customer acquisition costs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ecommerce companies that wish to succeed long term must figure out ways to overcome obstacles like higher customer acquisition costs. The best way to do so? Focus on digital experience (DX). This may be especially critical for more mature ecommerce companies. According to the Shopify report, “Many new competitors are not equipped to compete on customer experience, a top differentiator online, giving an edge to brands with immersive omnichannel experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The following are the top five challenges e-commerce companies are likely to face in 2021, along with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;research-backed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; guidelines for generating the type of digital experiences that can help you overcome these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecommerce Challenge #1: Growing customer expectations &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Shoppers have higher expectations than ever for the ecommerce companies they buy from. Things that were once nice-to-haves (like 24/7 online support, chat, easy navigation, personalization, and consistent and intuitive digital experiences across channels and devices) have now become table stakes. Yet according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/the-future-of-ecommerce/omnichannel&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Shopify’s report,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; only 38 percent of the largest companies can compete on digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Improving the customer experience to meet growing expectations starts with aligning the organization around that critical objective. According to our research, organizations that are less successful at delivering an ideal digital experience are 33 percent more likely to report that they struggle to create consensus among leaders about top digital experience priorities. Conversely, the data shows that more mature digital experience organizations are 93 percent more likely to agree or strongly agree that “everyone working on digital experience understands the organization’s goals and how to achieve them.” This finding implies that more mature organizations have transparent, shared goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our research also indicates it’s easier to create top-level consensus when there is a digital experience champion involved. In other words, first ensure that digital is a priority at the very top level of the organization, then make sure someone with organizational influence is accountable for that success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecommerce Challenge #2: The growth of mobile shopping&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Shopping through mobile devices will continue to rise in popularity and become a larger portion of total retail sales. Consider the following &lt;a href=&quot;https://review42.com/resources/mobile-marketing-statistics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;statistics from Review42&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People spend around 5 hours a day on their smartphones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;70 percent of web traffic comes from mobile phones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;61 percent of users will never return to a website that is not mobile-friendly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ecommerce retailers need to continue to develop and optimize their mobile-friendly sites. Additional statistics show us how doing so can pay off:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;80 percent of smartphone users will buy from companies with mobile sites and apps that are easy to navigate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;70 percent of the searches made on mobile phones lead to online action&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But organizations shouldn’t stop at mobile enablement. They also need to invest in technology that can provide them a complete view of the customer’s digital experience, including insights into sources of friction. If you’re losing customers at a certain point, you need to know why that’s occurring so you can address it. Yet our research shows that fewer than half (46 percent) of digital experience professionals have full visibility into causes of user frustration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Investing in tools &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;like FullStory&lt;/a&gt; that can capture and analyze both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/session-replay-elevates-qualitative-analytics&quot;&gt;quantitative and qualitative DX data&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to analyze where customers may be encountering problems so you can create a better digital experience for your users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecommerce Challenge #3: Growing acquisition costs &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ad costs took a dip during the early stages of the pandemic, but they’ve since bounced back and show no signs of dropping again. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/the-future-of-ecommerce&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;According to Shopify&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, late 2020 paid search spiked 17 percent and paid social advertising increased 24 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the same time, advertising channels and platforms are constantly expanding. Consumers can find products and brands in many ways today, which makes connecting with and attracting customers more challenging. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.finch.com/blog/biggest-challenges-in-ecommerce-2021/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;According to digital marketing company Finch&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, if you don’t meet—or exceed—your customers’ expectations, they may shop around. And with growing ecommerce options, they have plenty of other places to go. Improving customer retention rates with good DX is therefore vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our research examined how organizations are setting themselves up to deliver more perfect digital experiences and found it comes down to the ability to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easily prioritize digital fixes and improvements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quickly ship digital fixes and improvements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translate customer insights into action&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimize the digital experience for key conversions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The most successful companies find it fairly easy to tackle the first three capabilities. But optimizing key conversions can be a bit more of a struggle, even for mature organizations. Our study found 37 percent of all respondents, regardless of maturity, report that this is difficult to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecommerce Challenge #4: Sourcing the right technology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Delivering a more perfect digital experience requires organizational alignment and agility, so technologies that contribute to that are essential. That means finding technology solutions that give you a single source or seamless integration with your other technologies, provide a complete view of your customer’s digital experience, and proactively surface relevant digital experience insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to our research, only 18 percent of digital experience professionals report they can easily and proactively uncover useful insights about the customer’s digital experience. Fortunately, technologies exist that proactively point you toward actionable insights and automatically surface your most important opportunities for improvement according to potential business impact. Doing this will give you an advantage over most organizations—the ability to quickly identify and act on unforeseen opportunities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecommerce Challenge #5: Combating stagnation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The old adage, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” doesn’t work in the world of ecommerce. Customers want to see a constant influx of new products, information and features. That means organizations should adopt a relentless focus on testing, learning and improving DX. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to our research, companies that deliver better digital experiences are more likely to encourage testing and learning than their counterparts. And those efforts can pay off handsomely. Research from Optimizely shows that organizations that run a high volume of experiments—21 or more per month—drive a 14 percent increase in revenue. Compare that to organizations running fewer than 20 tests per month, driving 1 to 4 percent increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ultimately, organizations that want to succeed long-term need to encourage testing and learning and constantly and proactively strive to improve their digital maturity and DX. Doing so will prepare them to manage today’s challenges as well as whatever challenges come next. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

The work began optimistically and not long after we had a bunch of shiny React code in our codebase. Fast forward to now and we have thousands of React components. We’ve learned a lot along the way and one of the most important things is that simply converting from one framework to another wasn’t enough to unlock the full potential that we had hoped for from making the switch. In order to gain the full benefits of the conversion efforts we realized we would need to revisit some basic principles of software architecture and React’s core principles. We then implemented this research by creating 3 distinct React component categories which have dramatically improved our React codes maintainability, readability, testability, and scalability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this series of articles we will (1) talk about some basic principles of software and React architecture, (2) share our implementation of these principles as three categories of react components, (3) and finally share how this has leveled up our React code at FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Back to the basics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So before we get into how we architect our app at FullStory, let’s revisit some basic principles of software engineering and React.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Single Responsibility &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The principle of single responsibility states &lt;i&gt;“every class in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program&amp;#x27;s functionality, which it should encapsulate. All of that module, class or function&amp;#x27;s services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.”&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If we convert this to React terminology we would say that every &lt;i&gt;component&lt;/i&gt; should have a single responsibility. React components that have a single responsibility are much easier to reason about and change. A chief benefit of the single responsibility principle is the scalability of a thing that has a single responsibility. If that principle is adhered to, we would only change our component when the requirements for its one responsibility changes - otherwise the requirement must be met using a different component or tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s look at an example of a component called &lt;code&gt;StarWarsCharacters&lt;/code&gt; that displays a list of Star Wars characters and renders a form to create new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The component above is not a usable and complete component but it serves the purpose for this example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This component is very similar to many of the components we have in our codebase here at FullStory and maybe some of the ones in yours! Let’s see if this component fits into the single responsibility principle by listing out its responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It is responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accessing data from the redux store (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jcarroll2007/1cb61a6d9742533a3781369a067a43f4#file-starwarscharacters-multipleresponsibilities-jsx-L14&quot;&gt;Line 14 &lt;/a&gt;- 15)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing state of the create character form (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jcarroll2007/1cb61a6d9742533a3781369a067a43f4#file-starwarscharacters-multipleresponsibilities-jsx-L17&quot;&gt;Line 17&lt;/a&gt; - 21)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handling form submit (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jcarroll2007/1cb61a6d9742533a3781369a067a43f4#file-starwarscharacters-multipleresponsibilities-jsx-L23&quot;&gt;Line 23&lt;/a&gt; - 26)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dispatching the request action for fetching Star Wars characters (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jcarroll2007/1cb61a6d9742533a3781369a067a43f4#file-starwarscharacters-multipleresponsibilities-jsx-L28&quot;&gt;Line 28&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendering a loading state (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jcarroll2007/1cb61a6d9742533a3781369a067a43f4#file-starwarscharacters-multipleresponsibilities-jsx-L30&quot;&gt;Line 30&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendering and styling the list of characters to the UI (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jcarroll2007/1cb61a6d9742533a3781369a067a43f4#file-starwarscharacters-multipleresponsibilities-jsx-L34&quot;&gt;Line 34&lt;/a&gt; - 40)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a Route for the create character form (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jcarroll2007/1cb61a6d9742533a3781369a067a43f4#file-starwarscharacters-multipleresponsibilities-jsx-L44&quot;&gt;Line 44&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendering the create modal and form (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/jcarroll2007/1cb61a6d9742533a3781369a067a43f4#file-starwarscharacters-multipleresponsibilities-jsx-L47&quot;&gt;Line 47&lt;/a&gt; - 79)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wow. That’s a lot of responsibilities - 8 to be exact. So, no this component does not have a single responsibility or reason to change. Some of its responsibilities might narrowly fit into a single responsibility, but some of them definitely do not. It doesn’t seem quite right that, if we have a new requirement for some validation of the character form, we risk breaking the rendering or fetching of Star Wars characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are some good practices in this component and some separation of responsibilities. To name a few: we’re using a &lt;code&gt;Modal&lt;/code&gt; component that we can expect to handle “modal-ly” things, we’re passing off fetching logic and state management to redux, it’s not using class-based components, and is using hooks, but we can do even better!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Stay tuned to learn more about how we can address this in part two of this series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Composition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The second principle we keep in mind when architecting our React apps is the principle of composition. The principle of composition is a core feature of React and its component architecture. Composition is the name given to the arrangement of components of varying complexity and specificity. A component that adheres to the principle of composition is said to be &amp;quot;composable.&amp;quot; A composable component is one that is easily used inside of other components. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory we have an internal component library that is similar to popular community UI libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui&quot;&gt;Material UI&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/segmentio/evergreen&quot;&gt;Evergreen&lt;/a&gt;. In our component library we have a lot of components of varying specificity. Some have more specific purposes like the &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; is pretty straight forward. It provides styling and functionality that you would expect when using a button and is widely used across other components that require button functionality. Another example in our component library is our &lt;code&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt; dropdown component. Its purpose, again quite straight forward, is to provide the functionality of a button that opens a menu of selectable options. The &lt;code&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt; component uses the &lt;code&gt;Button&lt;/code&gt; component internally and is therefore utilizing composition. See the small example below for a visual representation of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Returning to the &lt;code&gt;StarWarsCharacters&lt;/code&gt; component example we can see that it uses composition in a few places, namely with the &lt;code&gt;Modal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Route&lt;/code&gt; components. But, we can do better! You can probably easily spot a few places that this component could be broken into smaller and more specific components. We&amp;#x27;ll revisit this how we can better utilize composition in part 2 of this series. So stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Testability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The last principle we focused on was testability. At FullStory we love writing tests because it makes us more confident that we won’t break things as we make changes. Therefore, the testability of our React components indirectly correlates to the confidence we have by making tests much easier to write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s see if our `StarWarsCharacters` component is testable by determining how easy it would be to test that the user cannot submit the create a character form unless they give the character a name. Looking at the component it looks like we’re going to have to do a lot of work in order to write this simple test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We would need to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mock redux&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mock react router&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mock api requests that are an internal implementation detail of the redux fetch actions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the create button&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Then we can finally write our form validation test. That’s a lot of work to test something that is completely isolated to form functionality. Say it with me - we can do better!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So we’ve discussed the principles of architecture that we want to keep in mind as we build our React components. We’ve seen an example that is probably similar to react components you might have seen before and how it breaks the principles we’ve discussed here. And we know we can do better! So, stay tuned for part 2 of this series where we will implement these principles to level up our &lt;code&gt;StarWarsCharacter&lt;/code&gt; component so that it is composed of components that have a single responsibility and are highly testable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Funnels: The unsung heroes of digital experience analysis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Flexible, powerful funnel analytics are one key to creating better digital experiences for your customers. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/funnel-analysis-for-digital-experience</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/funnel-analysis-for-digital-experience</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Laura Pressman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Understanding how your customers or end users move through your digital experience is essential to creating enjoyable interactions with your company, prioritizing what to build next, and strengthening customer loyalty. While there are many methods for understanding the user’s experience with your digital property, one critical tool in everyone’s kit is the funnel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the digital world, a “funnel” is a way of visualizing  data about how end users move through a series of steps in your product or website. Whether you’re an ecommerce product manager, a fintech director of UX, or a SaaS product researcher, it’s likely that there are multi-step workflows in your digital experience that you want to monitor for metrics like completion rates and unexpected user behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Funnel analyses can reveal valuable insights. At FullStory, we often hear success stories from customers about how running a quick funnel analysis on a crucial workflow in their product revealed both quick wins and major opportunities for improving their digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what should you look for in a funnel analysis tool? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Flexibility is key&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital experiences are complex, and your analytics tools should flex to meet an array of needs. There are two main ways that funnel analysis tools differ in flexibility: how they collect data, and how you can use that data in your analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manual instrumentation vs. codeless capture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first key distinction between flexible and rigid funnel analysis is the way in which the data powering your analysis is collected and accessed. Some funnel analysis tools are limited by the need for manual instrumentation of all user interactions across your digital property. In other words, they require you to manually tag every item in your product or website in order to analyze how users interact with those items. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s easy to imagine how this approach struggles to scale as a digital experience evolves and becomes increasingly complex over time. For example, you may want to assess if customers are moving through a new sign up flow as expected. If your new sign up page is not manually tagged ahead of time, running a funnel analysis on that user workflow will require costly engineering resources to implement followed by an indefinite period of wait time while data is collected on the newly tagged workflow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Other tools take a more flexible approach with &lt;a href=&quot;https://iterative.ly/blog/implicit-vs-explicit-event-tracking-hits-and-misses&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;implicit data capture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (also known as codeless capture, auto-tracking, and automatic event capture). This means that individual events and user interactions across your digital experience are captured and indexed without  manual tagging, providing you with more complete and accessible data about your product or website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For funnel analysis, this distinction is pivotal for ensuring that your results are accurate and provide a full picture of how users move through a workflow. If you’re missing data about specific steps in your funnel, or that data is not easily surfaced in the tool’s UI, you risk making decisions based on an incomplete understanding of the user experience that you’re trying to optimize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Event diversity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The other pillar of flexibility needed in your funnel analysis tool is the ability to pull in a diverse set of events for your funnel. Unfortunately, many tools can only handle page views or URL navigation for each step of a funnel. However, most websites and applications have workflows that involve more than simple, sequential page loads. Most likely, some of the most important workflows across your website or application require customers to take a variety of actions including clicks, page loads, scrolling, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Have an experience like the one pictured below? Funnels that are restricted to page navigation won’t properly show you who dropped out of the workflow because they encountered, for example, an error message upon the second step when clicking the “Add to Cart” button. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Frequently, your users take actions that have unique properties you want to package together into a single, “custom” event for analysis. For example, you may want to know the order quantity, shipping costs, and total price associated with each instance of a customer reaching the third step and viewing the “My Cart” page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition to out-of-the-box events like clicks and page views, truly flexible &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; powerful funnel tools should provide you with a way to surface those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/customize-fullstory-with-defined-events&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;custom events&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in your analyses as well. After all, even teams within the same company may need to analyze different customer use cases with funnels containing a variety of event types as steps.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Beyond quantitative insights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;All funnel analysis tools provide you with quantitative information about how many users complete the entire workflow, along with drop-off percentages for each step in the funnel. While this data is somewhat useful on its own, it becomes truly insightful when paired with qualitative information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While some platforms incorporate user surveys or customer feedback as vehicles for qualitative data, funnel analysis tools that also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/session-replay-elevates-qualitative-analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;pair with session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are most apt at highlighting &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; users exit multi-step workflows prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Often, quantitative data by itself won’t give you the level of insight necessary to take action or the level of empathy needed to address customer pain. Without a qualitative component of your funnel analysis, you’re left needing to conduct time-consuming customer interviews to understand behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When session replay is attached to a funnel, you can easily investigate why users are failing to make it through a process, or even why it’s taking customers longer than expected to move from one step to the next (and you only need to view &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-many-fullstory-sessions-to-watch&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a few&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sessions). When both quantitative (how many) and qualitative (why) insights coexist in a single view of your funnel analysis, you can continually innovate and optimize your digital customer experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Qualitative insights and flexibility for the win&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Funnels are part of every digital experience toolkit, but not all funnel analysis tools give you the full picture. For your analysis to be as effective, accurate, and actionable as possible, your funnel tool of choice should be flexible enough to surface all user interaction data, while also providing a qualitative component for deeper investigation into customer behavior. With both components, funnel analysis can become the hero in your journey to continuously optimize your digital experience.

Your team is likely overwhelmed with internal requests to generate reports, upload data, merge records, clean up bad data, and more. According to&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/larissafaw/2018/03/05/workers-waste-32-days-a-year-due-to-workplace-efficiency-apps/?sh=416241eb1d51&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Forbes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, most workers toggle between apps 10 times per hour, which equates to as much as 32 days lost in workplace productivity per year–and the  issue of app-hopping appears to be worsening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; Why can’t all of these applications just talk to each other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is an iPaaS?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If this sounds familiar, an integration platform as a service (iPaaS) can not only help manage these connections, but also give you the scale you need to grow. An iPaaS delivers cloud-based tools that enable teams to manage and integrate various applications and services from across their organization. For example, maybe your product managers want to share FullStory data with a customer data platform like Snowflake or Segment.io &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;your marketers are getting information about key segments over into Marketo &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;your sales team wants that same information for their CRM.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;An iPaas can help manage through all of these scenarios. They  are designed to simplify the integration process, often coming pre-configured with many commonly used business applications and a low setup cost.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; Here are five additional reasons iPaaS may be a great fit for your integration needs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ease&lt;/b&gt;: With pre-built integrations and low- or no-code tools, you can connect a wide variety of data sources and applications in minutes–compared to hand-coded strategies that can take, on average, 34 days. Longer term, having all connections in one place streamlines the process of managing integrations and querying them when you’re looking for something specific.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lower Cost: &lt;/b&gt;Because an iPaaS is typically billed as a monthly or annual subscription, your iPaaS represents a predictable, manageable expense. You only pay for the service level you need without incurring a large up-front investment. It also allows your team to avoid building an integration solution in-house, which would be expensive and complex to set up and manage. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexibility&lt;/b&gt;: As long as the integration platform offers a bridge for your applications, adding new apps to your tech stack doesn’t involve significant risk. An iPaaS can eliminate the labor, costs, hardware, and time commitment required to develop traditional integrations. This flexibility empowers end users by letting them use the technologies they want to use to do their jobs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transparency&lt;/b&gt;: Connecting systems and applications of value across the organization ensures a 360 degree view is made available to everyone who needs it, when they need it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alignment&lt;/b&gt;: With data readily available across systems and apps, employees in different departments can easily find and work off of the same set of information. By providing accurate, matching data across your applications, lines of business can collaborate more effectively and deliver better bottom-line results for the business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why not just use APIs?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s that? You’ve already integrated your systems with APIs? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; While APIs are a great option for many companies, an iPaaS solution can still work alongside APIs to provide real value. Not all APIs are the same–they will be different depending on who creates them, when they’re created, and the scenario for which they were written. Too, you often have to shoulder the burden of maintaining them which, just like infrastructure and hardware, can be costly and time-consuming–especially at scale (remember that stat about 137 applications?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; Using an iPaaS makes the data consistent and readable, regardless of the system, application or API on the receiving end. Eliminating inconsistency yields one (big) additional benefit: speed. In their report, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/doc/3755964/pervasive-integration-enables-api-initiatives&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;How Pervasive Integration Enables your API Initiatives (and Vice Versa)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” technology analyst Gartner finds that “Anecdotal evidence from Gartner clients’ experience suggests that by using an integration platform, time to value for integration logic can be reduced by up to 75% versus custom coding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; That time to value is important when you’re looking to share information about your digital experience. When customer satisfaction and conversion are on the line there isn’t a moment to waste! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory and iPaas: Common use cases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are some ways we’re seeing customers put them to work: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a user has more than 10 Rage Clicks (™) in one day, clients can leverage an iPaaS connector to automatically send the information to their marketing automation application and add the user to a product education drip campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a new note is created with the phrase “#bug,” the iPaaS connector can immediately share the update with Pivotal Tracker and create a new story on the backlog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful keystone events (such as signup complete, order checkout complete) can alert a #wins channel in a messaging app like Slack to let everyone know the good news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you’re looking to free up hundreds of thousands of dollars from your budget, need a more efficient way to bridge data silos, or just need to speed up the onboarding (and offboarding) of applications–you may want to explore the money and time saving benefits of iPaaS technology a little further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to get started&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition to our native &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/integrations&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, FullStory has pre-configured connectors available with three of the most popular iPaaS solutions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tray.io/connectors/fullstory-integrations&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tray.io&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.workato.com/integrations/community/fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workato&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/apps/fullstory/integrations&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zapier&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to streamline automation and keep the process easy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Double duty data layer]]></title><description><![CDATA[FullStory’s DLO (Data Layer Observer) is an open source library we built to tap into a customer’s data layer(s). ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-data-layer-and-fullstory</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-data-layer-and-fullstory</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Amanda Myers]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How FullStory helps you get &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; from what you’ve got&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Picture this: You’re a director of product at a SaaS company. Your marketing team puts a meeting on your calendar to discuss updates to the new website. This is amazing news from a visibility standpoint…but you’ve got to look beyond the launch and think about the data you’re collecting. Understanding who is going where and why they’re doing what they’re doing is vital to your company’s continued growth (not to mention your bonus). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How can you keep data consistent from one application to the next? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many companies do this by starting with a data layer, a JavaScript object that collects data on your website in a standardized way. Every tool you connect to your website—analytics, heat mapping, chat bots, etc.—accesses this one layer of data, which ensures two things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each tool gets the data it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data each tool uses is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does a data layer do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most websites, softwares, and applications have a series of layers, each with a different purpose: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;b&gt;presentation layer&lt;/b&gt;, which is what the visitor to your website sees. Oftentimes this layer is built using HTML and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;b&gt;data layer&lt;/b&gt;, the layer for collecting and managing the data produced. It’s a JavaScript object, often an array.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An&lt;b&gt; application layer&lt;/b&gt; with all the tools you connect to your website, like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and more. These are usually JavaScript snippets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every website has a presentation layer, and &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; every site has some sort of application layer. But not every site has a data layer to act as a dependable place to collect data as it’s generated. Without a data layer, data collection becomes the responsibility of other layers–and that’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s why: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you rely on the presentation layer to collect data, through processes like&lt;a href=&quot;https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/dom-scraping-data-layer-gtm-custom-js-variables/&quot;&gt; DOM scraping&lt;/a&gt; or&lt;a href=&quot;https://jimalytics.com/implementation/data-layer-or-css-selectors/&quot;&gt; CSS selectors&lt;/a&gt;, any change you make to the design or structure of your site will impact the data you collect. Small design changes can morph into huge data headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using the application layer to collect data is problematic in a different way because each tool would be allowed to collect its own data, each in a slightly different way. For instance, a page in Google Analytics might have a different name than in Mixpanel. Although it might not seem like a big deal, think about how it would complicate something as simple as trying to make sense of your website’s overall performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A data layer not only creates a dedicated place for data collection, but it’s also insulated from changes to other layers. Your stream of data won’t be subject to switching tools, design, or layout. It also makes sure each tool receives the data it needs to do its job. For example, say your new site needs some web analytics, so you turn to Google Analytics as well as Google Tag Manager (GTM) as your tag management system. With a data layer in place, implementing these tools won’t impact your website’s data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Put simply, a data layer can make your data more reliable and enhance functionality. What’s more, a data layer encourages your team to understand and align around data strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The data layer and FullStory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many FullStory customers have invested significant time and effort into building a data layer that lets them track custom events and user variables, often via data layers provided through vendors like Google, Tealium, or Adobe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As such, customers often ask how the data collected in  their  data layer can be made available in FullStory. Data layers contain important business data, including ecommerce conversion information and user profile data. It was through our work with customers that we discovered this rich vein of data that FullStory could mine to provide them more insights into the performance of their websites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Enter the Data Layer Observer (DLO, which is not to be confused with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Light_Orchestra&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;English rock band Electric Light Orchestra&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or ELO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory’s DLO is an open source library we built to tap into a customer’s data layer(s): JavaScript objects curated on webpages during user sessions, used commonly by analytics platforms such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/prepare/data-layer.html?lang=en#setting-data-layer-values&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adobe Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6164391?hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Tag Manager&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With this information, FullStory is able to automatically capture common data layer attributes and make them available in our application as custom events or user variables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our out-of-the-box integration works with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tealium iQ’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Data-Layer/Data-Layer-Definition-Retail/ta-p/17227&quot;&gt;Retail Definition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Analytics’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce&quot;&gt;Enhanced Ecommerce plugin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events&quot;&gt;Event Measurement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe Analytics&amp;#x27; &lt;a href=&quot;https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/evar.html?lang=en#vars&quot;&gt;eVar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/prop.html?lang=en#vars&quot;&gt;prop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data layers related to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2013/12/ceddl-201312.pdf&quot;&gt;Customer Experience Digital Data Layer&lt;/a&gt; specification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We have taken an intentional approach to data recording using vendor guidelines, and FullStory does not record user-specific information out-of-the-box. Here’s an example of how it works: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Maggie is a checkout product manager for a large ecommerce website. For years, her company has used Adobe Analytics to measure the effectiveness of different campaigns. She brought on FullStory hoping to gain more insight into the “why” behind &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;she’s been analyzing in Adobe. But since many of the variables she leverages in Adobe (e.g. cart total, element impressions, AB test cohort) aren’t available in FullStory, getting answers is a headache. It seemed her options were either to go without this data in FullStory, or (re)create custom events and fields for things that already exist in the Adobe data layer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the Data Layer Observer (DLO) Maggie can get a script she can add to her site (similar to the recording snippet) to bring data layer variables into FullStory. All she needs to do is add “rules” that decide what variables will be observed. FullStory provided Maggie with a set of ready-to-use rules based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2013/12/ceddl-201312.pdf&quot;&gt;CEDDL spec&lt;/a&gt;, and she got things squared away in no time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Interested in learning more?

The key takeaway from their responses is clear: digital is here to stay, and it’s time to double down on understanding and improving your digital experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Online transactions have hit record highs throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and companies across industries–from retail and dining to banking and healthcare–have seen their digital channels become their chief means of reaching and engaging customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While this spike in online transactions may have seemed temporary at first, it’s become clear that the digital-first mindset is here to stay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data backs this up. We recently surveyed 1,500 North American shoppers, and found that &lt;b&gt;8 in 10 (81%) plan to increase or maintain their online usage, even when in-person activities resume. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This means that organizations that have focused on their digital experiences thus far should continue to prioritize them. And for organizations that have been holding out for in-person transactions to return: now is the time to invest in your digital strategy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, what did the survey tell us about consumers’ perceptions and expectations for digital shopping experiences? Here are a few key takeaways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway #1: Not all digital experiences are created equal &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A seamless digital experience is a beautiful thing: a shopper locates the product they want, adds it to their cart, pays for it, and ultimately receives it at their door. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What makes a “good” digital experience in the eyes of consumers? According to the survey, 83% of respondents say that the most important factor is simply being able to “quickly accomplish what I came to do.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, things don’t always go this well. Digital issues and frustrations–like a product selection that’s difficult to navigate, a “view cart” button that doesn’t work, or a page that won’t load–are shockingly common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The survey found that &lt;b&gt;64% of respondents have been frustrated or struggled with an online transaction in the last six months&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, consumers reported that some industries are already excelling at digital experience, while others have some catching up to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailers were ranked the &lt;b&gt;highest&lt;/b&gt; by survey respondents, rated 34% excellent and 7% poor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks followed closely, with 26% excellent and 7% poor. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airlines have the &lt;b&gt;worst&lt;/b&gt; digital experiences, rated 27% poor and 10% excellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hotels and quick service restaurants also ranked low, with 13% poor and 7% excellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway #2: Digital errors are costly for businesses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Friction in your digital experience can hamper retention rates, erode customer trust, and ultimately have a direct impact on your bottom line. Data from the the survey showed: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seventy-seven percent of consumers (3 out of 4) reported that they will leave without completing a transaction&lt;/b&gt; if they encounter an error–which means that minor issues on your site can result in enormous losses in revenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After encountering just one such error on a site, &lt;b&gt;60% of respondents say they are unlikely to return&lt;/b&gt; to that site in the future, shrinking your pool of potential customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of survey respondents, &lt;b&gt;65% say they trust a business less&lt;/b&gt; when they experience a problem using a website or mobile app, ultimately splintering customer relationships and loyalty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As evidenced by the survey, it’s critical that you clear the path for customers to make transactions through your digital channels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway #3: Even when people report problems, it&amp;#x27;s most likely through manual and time-consuming methods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, most customers who experience digital issues don’t take the time to report them–they simply leave to find a site with a more seamless experience. Of the survey respondents, &lt;b&gt;only 12% say they are very likely to provide feedback to the business when they have a problem. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The act of leaving feedback is often itself a frustrating, time-consuming experience. Forty-nine percent of survey respondents said they report issues through surveys, while 41% and 40% do so by chatting or emailing the company, respectively. The catch? Most of these reports don’t go directly to the team that can actually fix the issue, leading to long ticket resolution times and other snags. Plus, it costs organizations thousands to employ teams to monitor and address the feedback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What kinds of common issues might these users be trying to report? According to the survey, the most frustrating issues for consumers are: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page glitches (55%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forms that don’t accept inputs correctly (45%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page load errors (42%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reveal the flaws in your digital experience–and figure out how to fix them–with FullStory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, more than ever, you need to understand what your customers are doing (or are unable to do) on your website. Digital transactions will continue to rise, and investing in scalable digital experience intelligence now is critical for your business’s long-term growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With FullStory, you can &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; exactly when, where, and why customers are leaving your website, and identify and prioritize the changes you need to make in order to keep them. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/why-customers-dont-come-back&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;(It’s like having a pair of magic goggles for your website 😎.)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you’re just beginning to think about your digital experience strategy, or you’re ready for a more robust digital experience intelligence solution, FullStory’s data and analytics have the answers you need.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get a demo today.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Forrester Report: Product management tools are “tech you can no longer afford to ignore”]]></title><description><![CDATA[Forrester recently released a new report that examines vendors in the product management tools and tech market.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/forrester-report-product-management-tools</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/forrester-report-product-management-tools</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Forrester recently released a new report that examines vendors in the product management tools and tech market. The report, titled &lt;i&gt;New Tech: Digital Product Management Tools and Tech, Q2 2021,&lt;/i&gt; explores how product managers across a range of industries are increasingly seeking productivity tools to help them solve product management challenges and develop successful digital products. As Forrester puts it, product management tools are “tech you can no longer afford to ignore.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the report, Forrester stresses that using tools like FullStory to support well-designed product management practices is now critical to building a robust product management capability for digital. Because these tools are proven to increase customer value, improve product adoption, and drive higher customer retention and revenue growth, they are now considered a vital component of any digital product marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Included in the report as a “growth-stage” tech known for working with companies such as Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC), Lowe’s, and Nationwide Insurance, FullStory helps organizations revolutionize their digital experiences by combining quantitative and qualitative data into scalable, actionable user behavior insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The report found that increased demand for product management tools is fueling swift  growth in the market. In fact, Forrester found that venture capital (VC) investment in this market is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of nearly 50 percent. More VC naturally leads to more players in the market, and the report reviews 48 bootstrapped or VC-backed digital product management tools and tech vendors, and six mature vendors in the product management tools market today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To read more about emerging vendors in the product management tools and tech market, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forrester.com/report/New+Tech+Digital+Product+Management+Tools+And+Tech+Q2+2021/-/E-RES165066&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;download the report &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (please note: a paid subscription is required).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Travel + Leisure Co. supports its “customer obsession” with digital analytics from FullStory and Qualtrics]]></title><description><![CDATA[Travel + Leisure Co. surfaces new insights and addresses emerging challenges with FullStory and Qualtrics. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dx-and-xm-insights-with-fullstory-and-qualtrics</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dx-and-xm-insights-with-fullstory-and-qualtrics</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Madison Eubanks]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The digital experience intelligence unearthed by FullStory is rich and incredibly valuable–and can be made even more so when integrated with complementary software solutions from FullStory’s partner ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By pairing FullStory and Qualtrics, an experience management (XM) platform, Travel + Leisure Co. (formerly Wyndham Destinations) combines digital feedback with behavioral patterns and cues to surface new insights and address emerging challenges before they negatively impact sales and satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory enables digital professionals like those at Travel + Leisure Co. to understand and improve their digital products and experiences based on precise insights into what customers are doing–and why–on websites and mobile apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When partnered, FullStory’s real-time behavioral data, AI-driven heuristics, and session replay are tightly integrated with Qualtrics’ XM insights to provide a more comprehensive understanding of customers and how they respond to digital experiences. Predictive models, automated workflows, and collaboration tools ensure that brands can act quickly to transform this combined data into customer-centric experience improvements that drive growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Kevin T. McAuliffe, VP of Digital Transformation and Delivery at Travel + Leisure Co., joined us for a webinar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualtrics.com/events/understanding-decoding-digital-customer-experience-with-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Decoding the Digital Experience for Travel and Hospitality&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can be accessed on-demand. The interactive discussion explores how Travel + Leisure Co. navigated the challenges of the previous year, using XM and DX insights to rapidly adjust its approach to digital experience management over multiple touch points, journeys, and channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“As we enhance our digital footprint, our priority is customer obsession,” said McAuliffe. “We need to understand how our customers use what we are building and how they actually consume a digital experience. Digital analytics allow us to understand perception and behavior together so we have our eyes wide open about the customer journey and can make the best decisions about where to spend effort and capital.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Teams throughout an organization can take advantage of the insights gained through the FullStory and Qualtrics integration. DX and UX teams can systematically match customer sentiment and perception with specific user sessions to rapidly pinpoint, scope, and solve emerging problems that are out of reach of traditional analytics tools. Marketing teams can closely manage the digital customer experience by taking advantage of predictive insights and automated workflows to impact customer decision-making and influence the customer journey. Developers and engineers can pair business-level insights and visualizations with back-end network and console information to understand issues, prioritize fixes, remediate bugs, and measure the impact of those changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, Travel + Leisure Co. product managers have been able to take a pulse on irregularities in digital implementations and use FullStory to understand which issues are one-offs and which are ongoing trends that need to be prioritized and addressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Just like successful face-to-face communication requires interpreting both verbal and nonverbal cues, a complete understanding of the full customer experience requires brands to understand and act on both ‘spoken’ and ‘unspoken’ digital cues and signals,” said Agata Bugaj, VP of Product at FullStory. “Together, Qualtrics and FullStory not only provide this unified understanding—including important signals like Rage Clicks—but also the ability to quickly take action to improve every aspect of the digital experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;To watch the on-demand webinar with FullStory, Qualtrics, and Travel + Leisure Co., &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qualtrics.com/events/understanding-decoding-digital-customer-experience-with-fullstory/?utm_source=fullstorymarketing&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;click here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gartner reports that Digital Analytics are must-have tech for ecommerce success]]></title><description><![CDATA[Why a Digital Analytics solution like FullStory should be part of your ecommerce technology ecosystem. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/gartner-reports-digital-analytics-are-crucial-to-ecommerce-success</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/gartner-reports-digital-analytics-are-crucial-to-ecommerce-success</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A new vendor guide from Gartner Group helps companies better understand and evaluate digital commerce platforms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Though the importance of offering a great digital experience has been growing for some time, the pandemic compounded this need by catalyzing a huge spike in online commerce. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2020/04/29/online-sales-jump-49-bopis-grows-208-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;According to Adobe Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, U.S. online sales in April 2020 increased 49 percent over the year prior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While many parts of the world are glimpsing the end of the pandemic, Gartner and other top analysts predict that ecommerce sales will remain high for many years to come, as consumers increasingly rely on convenient digital channels to support their purchasing needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In fact, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-consumer-survey&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a recent survey of 1,500 North American consumers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, FullStory found that 8 in 10 (81%) plan to increase or maintain their online usage, even when in-person activities resume. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Gartner Digital Commerce Vendor Guide 2021&lt;/i&gt; was published based on Gartner’s finding that success in digital commerce now hinges on having the right tools in place to deliver compelling experiences and respond to business needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider your entire digital commerce technology stack&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The growth in ecommerce sales is likely to result in increased competition in the ecommerce arena. For that reason, more businesses are turning to digital commerce platforms to get ahead of the competition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Gartner recommends using an “ecosystem” approach, in which multiple applications are tightly integrated to optimize the digital commerce technology stack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the report, Gartner examines digital commerce platforms from multiple categories, including the category Digital (Web) Analytics. Solutions from this category, like FullStory, enable ecommerce businesses to collect, analyze, and report on user behavior, friction, and customer journeys. These tools help businesses better understand how users navigate their site and provide insights into how and where to improve the customer experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In other words, making confident, strategic DX decisions—like which site fixes or improvements to prioritize—requires a complete view of the customer’s digital experience. Digital analytics provide the quantitative and qualitative data necessary to do this, and platforms like FullStory make it easy to interpret and act on that data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the changing digital commerce landscape, the competition is fierce–and it’s only getting fiercer. Prioritizing the digital experience by investing in a digital analytics platform like FullStory can help you create a great customer experience that promotes loyalty, growth, and retention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visit &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3982167/the-gartner-digital-commerce-vendor-guide-2021&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gartner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; to read the full analysis &lt;/b&gt;(note, a paid subscription is required to access the report).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surfacing experience unknowns with new engagement signals]]></title><description><![CDATA[Using FullStory engagement Signals for a better understanding of user behavior and frustration. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-digital-engagement-signals</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-digital-engagement-signals</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Laura Pressman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to BuiltWith, &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;over 100 million websites&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; employ some form of analytics or user tracking software. The events of 2020 drastically accelerated the need for digital transformation and online experience investments across industries, and it’s clearer than ever that understanding how customers navigate and interact with your website or app is no longer optional, but imperative to business success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s also no surprise that, of all websites using visitor tracking and web traffic analysis tools, &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;over half&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have installed Google Analytics. After all, it’s a free tool that offers a basic understanding of how people find your digital business and which pages receive the most visits. But even Google is starting to acknowledge that metrics like page visits, and even time spent on a website, are not reliable indicators of a positive user experience. Only tracking page visits and referral traffic fails to give you the complete picture of how customers interact with your digital business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a result, Google will soon roll out a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/google-page-experience-update-2021&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Page Experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; signal, which will measure a combination of site performance and experience metrics, and push sites with more user-friendly digital experiences to the top of search results. Given that Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/page-experience#signals&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;doesn’t intend to outline &lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; different metrics are weighted in this assessment, it’s critical that you have additional, at-a-glance insights into how users are experiencing your website or application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While Google is refining the criteria they use to rank pages, the ways we interact with websites, products, and applications continue to expand beyond simply clicking and typing. Now, visitors swipe, scroll, highlight, and pinch their way through digital experiences, creating additional data points to monitor and measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This means your teams have an ever-growing amount of data to analyze. Uncovering which digital experience improvements will move the needle can prove a challenge for even the most sophisticated digital experience teams–which is why you need a way to break through the noise and extract valuable insight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch for key experience signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By tapping into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/finding-dxi-signals-through-the-noise&quot;&gt;the right signals&lt;/a&gt;, organizations can better utilize their website data to quickly improve their users’ experiences. FullStory provides pre-configured interaction Signals, making it easy to understand how users navigate your site, spot where they get frustrated, and pinpoint how engaged they are with your content&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Frustration signals are crucial to quickly spotting opportunities to improve your users’ experience. In addition to FullStory’s signature&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights&quot;&gt; &lt;u&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and over a dozen other out-of-the-box Signals, you can now add &lt;b&gt;four new Signals to your repertoire for understanding user engagement and frustration: Scroll Depth, Highlighted, Pinch-to-Zoom, and Refreshed.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Uncover your most engaging content and product areas &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scroll Depth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Are visitors reading your valuable long-form content? Or is there important information sitting at the bottom of lengthy pages in your product? Analyze how far your users are scrolling on key pages of your website or application, then reorganize the page’s content or adjust the design to better drive your desired user engagement.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlighted&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s a reason why Medium introduced the “Highlight” capability to posts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.productboard.com/blog/how-medium-highlights-feature-changed-publishing/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;back in 2015&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: engagement often matters more than volume of upvotes or views, and giving people a way to indicate the most interesting pieces of a story is insightful to authors. Whether it’s a blog post intended to spark interest in your B2B software or an article meant to drive sales on your ecommerce site, knowing which parts of your content customers are highlighting can indicate what they’re interested in or find most useful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Monitoring which elements are being highlighted can also illuminate deeper visitor behavior insights. For example, an ecommerce shop can better understand the impact of comparison shopping on their conversion rates by analyzing how frequently customers highlight specific elements, such as product names, to paste and search for lower prices elsewhere. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Surface friction in key points of the user experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pinch-to-Zoom&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With Pinch-to-Zoom, quickly find places where users need to zoom in or out to enhance visuals or change sizing of certain elements on your website or product. For many companies, pinch-to-zoom activity indicates an opportunity to improve the user experience through additional visuals or adjustments to a page’s design and layout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, a major retailer’s product and UX teams use the quick insights they gain from the Pinch-to-Zoom signal to test a larger font size and the addition of zoom functionality on their product description pages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Refreshed&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The new Refreshed signal is another way to pinpoint friction in your digital experience. Users will often reload a page experience if they don’t see an expected change on the page, an image or video element is broken or missing, or they encounter a performance problem where the website fails to render properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, you can easily spot when a user’s expectations don&amp;#x27;t align with what they’re seeing on their screen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Deeper understanding without the dev work &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Perfecting your digital experience starts with understanding &lt;b&gt;what&lt;/b&gt; is happening on your site or app, and &lt;b&gt;why&lt;/b&gt;. FullStory’s out-of-the-box Signals automatically collect and analyze key interactions to help you work smarter, providing key insights about your users’ behavior. Scroll Depth, Highlighted, Pinch-to-Zoom and Refreshed are just a few of the latest ways FullStory is empowering teams with digital experience intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Want to learn more about how FullStory can help you perfect your digital experience? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;Let’s talk!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Already a FullStory customer?

Effective product managers set up intentional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/medallia-and-fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;feedback loops&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that allow them to monitor how different elements of their product are being experienced at various points in the customer journey. They also know how to interpret the feedback they receive and where to apply it in a product’s lifecycle. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the 2021 &lt;a href=&quot;https://summit.productledalliance.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Product-Led Alliance CPO Summit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, FullStory Head of Product Marketing Amanda Myers hosted a panel discussion where digital product leaders shared their insights and best practices for using these feedback loops strategically to make informed product decisions. The panelists included: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dana Rosenberg, VP of Product Management, &lt;b&gt;Mastercard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaurav Jaiswal, VP of Digital Product Management, &lt;b&gt;Pearson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Pai, VP of Product, &lt;b&gt;Clubhouse.io&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akanksha Manik Talya, Former VP, Digital Product Management, &lt;b&gt;GE Digital&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Here are their top four strategies for using feedback loops to build better product experiences. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Know which types of feedback to use at different points in the product lifecycle &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;All product feedback is relevant, but not all product feedback is relevant &lt;i&gt;all the time. &lt;/i&gt;Successful product managers employ different feedback gathering techniques depending on what phase or area of the product they’re focused on. For example, Gaurav Jaiswal’s team at Pearson leverages usability studies and primary research while in the ideation and research phase, but might turn to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/nps-surveys-fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;NPS surveys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and A/B testing to understand the product experience later in the customer journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another factor to consider, according to Akanksha Talya, is the mode and market your company is currently in. A small company that’s in a high-growth mode should be focusing on proactive feedback and how market data is trending, while a more established company can afford to spend more time reacting to feedback that might come from customer support channels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No matter the product stage or growth phase, one key point that the panelists noted is the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;continuously combining quantitative and qualitative data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get the full picture. Quantitative metrics are useful for high-level planning, but those softer qualitative insights add context that can help you drive action on a day-to-day basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2. Identify and prioritize the most meaningful signals from your pool of feedback&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With so many ways to collect feedback, both from customers and internal stakeholders, it can be easy to get lost in the noise of questions, opinions, and feature requests. How can you determine which signals from your feedback loops are worth acting on? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For the panelists, the key is ensuring that the feedback signals you’re focusing on always align to the business’s larger goals, and referencing those goals often. For Nick Pai’s team at Clubhouse, a big piece of this is avoiding “unintended consequences” by thinking about what they &lt;i&gt;don’t&lt;/i&gt; want to do. For example, acting rashly based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;signal data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might cause a company to inadvertently end up in front of markets and/or personas that aren’t part of the business strategy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In an instance when multiple feedback signals crop up at once, Pearson teams prioritize them by evaluating which are strategically aligned with: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they want the product to be, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anticipated ROI of acting on that signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This can mean asking questions like, “Does this help expand our market and/or drive adoption, or is it just a nice-to-have feature that only a subset of customers want?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of course, it’s inevitable that product managers will inadvertently act on a “false signal” and respond in a way that doesn’t actually benefit users. In these instances, Akshanka’s outlook is that product leaders should encourage a culture of “constructive discovery,” in which it’s okay to make—and learn from—mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3. Get stakeholder buy-in every step of the way &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to our research on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/DX-Maturity.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;State of Digital Experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, organizations with &lt;i&gt;more mature&lt;/i&gt; digital experience strategies emphasize the democratization of data, enabling team members to directly access the information necessary to their job functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This practice was echoed by panelist Gaurav Jaiswal, who says that Pearson uses robust self-service dashboards that allow stakeholders to have an at-a-glance look at quantitative and qualitative product insights at any point in time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition to ensuring that stakeholders and leaders can access relevant product metrics in real time, it’s also important for product managers to continually tie progress and projects back to high-level business goals. Dana Rosenberg says that her team at Mastercard is constantly aligning smaller outcomes with the larger objectives they set at the beginning of the year or quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“When you go back to stakeholders with that ‘Aha!’ moment after achieving an outcome, it’s important to retell the story around your big objectives and ladder the results back to that original vision. This gives stakeholders visibility into how you got to the result, which has been critical to our success with executives.”

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;- Dana Rosenberg, VP of Product Management, Mastercard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Akanksha also stressed the importance of having visibility at multiple levels of an organization, saying that, “Leaders need to have strategic intent and a clear picture of how smaller milestone initiatives align with that strategic intent.” 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. “Unlearning” can be just as important as learning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For digital businesses, major market shifts can happen seemingly overnight, making flexibility even more critical for digital pros hoping to withstand evolution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nick’s advice is to avoid “getting stuck” thinking only of your existing customers, and to remember to look ahead to where the market is headed and where you want your product to be positioned within it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Similarly, Gaurav says that his teams at Pearson try to “steer clear of confirmation bias and building yourself into an echo chamber.” While it’s easy to surround yourself with positive feedback, hearing what &lt;i&gt;isn’t&lt;/i&gt; working for customers is far more valuable to your product’s long term success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Staying away from your own bias is key to continuing to grow and learn. You can’t fall in love with what you thought at the beginning,” says Mastercard’s Dana Rosenberg. Product managers who get caught up on one particular idea or school of thought might be less able to listen and respond to what’s going on in the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We want to create a culture where we fall in love with the problem and not the solution, and then unlearning becomes way easier.”

With more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/510333/worldwide-public-cloud-software-as-a-service/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;$157 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the SaaS market (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketresearch.com/IDC-v2477/Worldwide-SaaS-Cloud-Software-Forecast-9255084/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;more than triple&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; what it was in 2014) there’s near-exponential opportunity. The pandemic hit the gas pedal for the industry, pushing some companies to &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/04/saas-earnings-rise-as-pandemic-pushes-companies-more-rapidly-to-the-cloud/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;triple-digit growth numbers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, rapid growth can come with increased competition. For SaaS organizations, the stakes are high, and the market is increasingly crowded and competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory CEO Scott Voigt and I dove into the impact of this competitive, high-stakes landscape at the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saastrenterprise.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;SaaStr Enterprise conference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

But the &lt;i&gt;ways&lt;/i&gt; in which companies are engaging their customers haven’t really evolved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taking a traditional approach to customer analysis and engagement in a digital world doesn’t really click.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forrester.com/report/The+State+Of+CX+Measurement+And+VoC+Programs+2020/-/E-RES165703?objectid=RES165703&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;According to Forrester&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 70% of CX programs don’t go beyond surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salesforce.com/blog/customer-service-stats/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;According to Salesforce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 91% of customers who are unhappy with a brand will leave without complaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When Scott co-founded FullStory in 2014, he found that when asked how well they understand their users on a scale of 1 to 10, SaaS professionals reported somewhere between 2 and 3 on average. When we asked this same question to the SaaStr Enterprise audience, the average was 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, what’s that mean for you? While there’s been growth in recent years, everyone’s got a long way to go. The good news is excelling at understanding your customers will put you way ahead of the pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer insights don’t have to be a nebulous, impenetrable black box. With the right tools in place, teams like yours can peek inside and uncover useful, actionable information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve drilled down to three digital insights to understand, win, and retain customers—and make your organization stand out in an increasingly crowded field of competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three key SaaS insights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.) Focus on the buyer’s journey to improve conversion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“I’ve got Google Analytics and A/B testing tools in my tech stack,” you might say. “Doesn’t that cover all my bases?” The short answer: not quite. The longer answer: those give you an idea of &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; is happening, but fall short with the qualitative aspect—the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;. For instance, &lt;i&gt;why &lt;/i&gt;aren’t your prospects becoming customers? The entirety of your buyer’s journey can only be understood with both halves of the equation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, one customer was looking to increase app signups. Using FullStory, their team noticed a high number of Rage Clicks and dead clicks on a logo on the signup page, confusing it for something actionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cutting that logo out of the page entirely yielded a 7% increase in registration completion—all because they uncovered &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; those clicks were happening, not just that they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The team at Thomas solved a similar problem, resulting in a 94% conversion rate increase. &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.ctfassets.net/dkgr2j75jrom/4omyVtOEBhuwGQ4JMjKny4/289f9eb538c663c506af23fe123d2e86/fs-thomas-1-pager-lowres.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read their case study here.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.) Hone in on product adoption and usage insights to spur innovation and enablement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Getting users to click “enroll” or “buy” is one thing, but encouraging engagement with your product after that hurdle has been cleared is another entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You need to understand the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; behind what’s going on with a particular feature, flow for a unique cohort, or group of users. Again, this is where mixing quantitative and qualitative data is critically important. If you only know that someone dropped off, but don’t know why or can’t see their flow or session, you’re left without a lot of answers. Multiply that by untold numbers of locations on your website, and you could be jeopardizing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we practice what we preach. After launching a new product feature last year, we saw slower adoption than we would have liked. Our own digital experience intelligence surfaced issues at a certain point in the user flow and we quickly drilled down via session behavior to uncover a substantial hurdle: many users weren’t sure how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Through building, refining, and placing the training right at the point where users fall out, the team was able to drive 75% increase in successful usage of that feature in a three-month period. That’s information we wouldn’t have had if we’d relied solely on quantitative data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.) Extract customer engagement and support insights to retain users&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While some logo churn is inevitable for companies of all sizes, that doesn’t mean working to minimize it is a lost cause. Five percent churn is the industry-wide average, but many best-in-class companies do better than that by pinpointing customer support insights and turning them into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sendoso.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sendoso&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a company that helps teams connect with customers via personalized gifts, swag, and more, uses FullStory to understand and improve customer engagement, acquisition, and retention at scale. With the FullStory platform, the team can see a stack ranking of suspected bugs, understand how many people are affected, watch session replay, and triage problems accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.ctfassets.net/dkgr2j75jrom/EmSR02SYNeIiXB6Q4qDOo/6a0d8df255f07af54a9f9c8c20bf3760/fs-sendoso-cvr-lr.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read the full Sendoso case study here.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This proactive stance is one that could help any SaaS company—yours included—stem losses from preventable churn and differentiate from your competition in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take the next step&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When your competition is a click away, moments matter, and every imperfect digital experience is costing your business. Keeping a focus on digital experience intelligence is what separates brands in SaaS. While the steps may be easy to understand, implementation takes work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s where FullStory can help. By combining the quantitative and qualitative in real time, FullStory’s platform eliminates the blind spots in your data.

One that ushers in the summer with colorful flags, fun parades, and lots of cocktails. But in reality, it’s far greater than that. It started as a form of revolution, an uprising against oppression. The first Pride was a protest at The Stonewall Inn, a bar in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is why Pride matters to me. Not only do I enjoy celebrating it with all my friends, but I take privilege in doing so for all those that cannot. Moreover, I stand in solidarity with all people who are still fighting for their Pride—for people in places where it is still as dangerous to march and fight for Pride today as it was during that first event in 1969, over 50 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the initial fights for liberation were more pivotal and culturally catalytic, the work that’s being done today in workplaces around the world for equity and recognition is no less important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why I started the QueerStorians group&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In June 2020, the unimaginable happened. I am not referring to the horrendous murders of George Floyd or Breonna Taylor, because, unfortunately for most people that look like me in the United States, this is just part of our reality. What was unimaginable to me was people starting to want to talk about it, to share, and to collectively grieve within a professional setting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For the first time in my life, I felt free to share my pain, my opinions, and my reality with my co-workers. As such, I decided to start an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.catalyst.org/topics/ergs&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ERG (Employee Resource Group)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Black and African American employees at my previous company. It became a safe space to share, get to know each other better, and discuss parts of the company culture that could be improved for employees like us and others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Later that year, I joined FullStory. As many of us have now become familiar with, starting a fully remote job on a fully remote team, in a fully remote company during a global pandemic is not easy. Plus the added difficulties of managing different time zones. Despite meeting a lot of my amazing colleagues in regular meetings and through tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.donut.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Donut&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I still found it hard to build a sense of belonging and community remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some of my best and longest lasting professional relationships were fostered with people outside my team and department in more informal company settings. I remembered all the great engineers I met from playing soccer as part of the company team one summer—people who I would have never gotten to know otherwise. Or the great conversations I had during happy hours dedicated to networking with other women in tech as part of the women’s ERG programming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bidirectional company cultures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So in true Revenue Operations fashion, I decided to go out and source—in other words, figure out—if a group for LGBTQIA+ employees like myself and allies was something of interest, as well as if our People Operations team felt it was appropriate. I came up with the name “QueerStorians” because at FullStory we love quirky names for everything but also refer to ourselves as “FullStorians”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some ideas floating around my head: “FullQueers” or the less-inclusive “LGBStorians.” I settled on QueerStorians as the word Queer is used as an umbrella term to cover all members of the community. I wanted this group to be as inclusive as possible. Fast forward to today, QueerStorians is 41 members strong and building new connections each and every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What I think is important to highlight here are the different roles employees, the company, and leadership play in creating community, and, consequently, culture. QueerStorians became a reality because the company provided a culture where I felt it was safe and even appropriate to create such a group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From day one, we had the immediate support of the People Operations team, who not only helped facilitate administrative tasks like getting our monthly meeting on the all-company calendar. They also reached out to us ahead of Pride month and offered  QueerStorians to lead our all-company programming: our Pride flag logo take over, charity swag drive and internal voices conversations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Starting your own Queer Employee Resource Group&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I know I’m not the only person who’s wanted to start a group like this. If you’re considering a group like this in your organization, here’s what I’ve learned along the way.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;It really does take two&lt;/b&gt;—or, rather, a two-way connection—because company culture is bidirectional. Leadership sets the tone of the culture and employees create the community within and around it. When leadership goes out of their way to foster a culture where employees know that all aspects of their professional, personal, and developmental lives matter, space is created for individuals to take a step further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; 2.&lt;b&gt; Make it work for you.&lt;/b&gt; Not all companies need the same ERGs. What’s important is that employees are able to create the communities they feel they need to thrive, to connect and to develop a sense of belonging. In tech spaces such as ours, we focus more on ethnic and gender minorities because those are the historically underrepresented groups in our sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Sharing is caring.&lt;/b&gt; Everyone joins ERGs for different reasons. In talking to different QueerStorians, we all have our own personal reasons for joining and wanting this community. But until we share and speak about it, one may assume it’s only needed for people who identify as Queer or any of the many letters that make up the community. I have learned that this is far from the truth. Some QueerStorians were brought up in very progressive environments and joined because they have spent their entire lives in spaces like this and it only felt natural. Some QueerStorians joined in support of their Queer children and other family members. Other QueerStorians joined because they are still figuring things out, and that’s okay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I want to end this with one of my favorite quotes, the quote that has kept me going and will keep me going for the rest of my life. As the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. put it, “We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Kind of like a rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether it’s out marching in the streets or from the comfort of your new work-from-home kitchen table/desk, the fight for justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion needs to happen everywhere for it to make a difference anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The office is no different. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Build your own automated sync bot via GitHub Actions]]></title><description><![CDATA[A technical walk-through of our solution using GitHub Actions to sync up files in our open-source repositories with our closed-source code changes.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/build-your-own-automated-sync-bot-via-github-actions</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/build-your-own-automated-sync-bot-via-github-actions</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sabrina Li]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory is a Digital Experience Intelligence platform that recreates user interactions on websites and native mobile apps to provide our customers with insights on where they can improve user experience. We strive to create an easy implementation path for developers so that they can get FullStory running on their sites quickly. To that end, initializing FullStory is as easy as copying/pasting several lines of JavaScript code (called “the snippet”) into the website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This works very well for traditional HTML sites, and is also pretty simple via a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Content Management System (CMS)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_management_system&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tag Manager,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828413&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;eCommerce platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, if the website is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Single Page Application (SPA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; built using frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, etc., this path is less than ideal. We realized that we needed to provide an idiomatic way to add the recording snippet and our client JavaScript APIs to SPAs. So, we built an open source NPM package: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fullstory/browser&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory Browser SDK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Maintainability of the snippet in the browser SDK&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because we provide installation instructions both in our web app and also programmatically in the SDK, the core snippet code is now hosted in two places: in our closed source repository and on an open source repository that contains the code distributed via NPM. So, how do we keep this critical piece of code in sync across two repositories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If we were to do this manually, we would have to remember to update the open source repo whenever we release a new version of the snippet. This would involve two separate teams (the team who maintains the snippet source code, and those who maintain the open source repo) to coordinate their work. And if you frown at that, so did we. We wanted an automated way to keep the open source code in sync with the snippet code inside the closed-source repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;An automated solution built on GitHub Actions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We needed a good way for our internal microservices as well as the open source consumers to share a single source of truth without being tightly coupled. We initially considered a “push” model where our build system would push any snippet updates to the open source repo and create a PR. The drawback is that it would require our build system to maintain secrets and understand the structure of our open source repo, and to maintain a repository that it does not own. These added complexities and dependencies in the build system are not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Eventually, we came up with a solution that relies on two technologies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new public API that we host which returns the snippet code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In adding GitHub Actions to our open source repo, it was trivial to use the built-in cron function to pull the latest snippet code that we expose via the public API endpoint. All we needed was to create a new microservice to serve the snippet for a variety of different clients to consume. Moreover, GitHub Actions has built-in git operations and GitHub management APIs, which make it easy to automatically update the snippet file, check out a new branch, open a PR, and assign it to the correct reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A tour inside the &lt;code&gt;Snippet-Sync-Job&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 1. Building the snippet service and exposing a public API endpoint&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to be able to pull the latest snippet from our closed-source repos, we needed to expose a public API serving the snippet code. It serves up either a “core” or “ES Module” version of the snippet based on the URL parameters passed in. And voila! We have a way to pull the latest snippet. It’s worth noting that the service is used by various other services we host internally via gRPC as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 2. Adding Github Actions to our open source repo&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To enable GitHub actions, first create a &lt;code&gt;main.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file inside &lt;code&gt;.github/workflows&lt;/code&gt; folder. And with just a few lines, we can define a cron job and pull for updates every 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;GitHub actions make it trivial to authenticate in a workflow: it provides a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#about-the-github_token-secret&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN secret&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and several other &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environment-variables&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;default environment variables&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the snippet API endpoint, we now have all we need to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We will use all the imported environment variables and the parsed &lt;code&gt;repoInfo&lt;/code&gt; later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 3. Check for snippet updates and existing open PRs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;Sync snippet&lt;/code&gt; step, we’ve already checked out the latest &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch. We first use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/axios/axios&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;axios&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to pull the latest snippet text via REST API, then compare the hash of the latest snippet text with the one we have on the file system of the checked out repo. We continue to the next steps only when we find the mismatch in the hash values, meaning a snippet update has been detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If we determine that an update is needed, we initialize an octokit client, which is provided by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/github&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;@actions/github&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package. The client is authenticated using the &lt;code&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; env var declared in the &lt;code&gt;main.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We then get the list of current open PRs and check to see if the same PR has already been created. Since we run the sync job every 24 hours, it’s possible that an existing PR has been opened but not yet merged, in which case we do not want to open another PR. We achieve this by simply looking for a PR created by the Github Actions bot, and that the title is a constant:  “The FullStory snippet has been updated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 4. Use Github &lt;code&gt;octokit&lt;/code&gt; to obtain the tree object&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next step is to update the &lt;code&gt;snippet.js&lt;/code&gt; file and create a PR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to programmatically update the file and open a PR, we needed to get deeper into what git calls the &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Plumbing commands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you are not familiar with the inner workings of git, we recommend following the above hyperlink to read about it before continuing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tree Object&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the data structure that holds the relationships between your files (blobs), similar to a simplified UNIX file system. We need to first create a new &lt;code&gt;Tree Object&lt;/code&gt; with the new contents of the snippet code. And then use the newly created tree to checkout a branch and open a new PR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To do so we need to first get the current commit. At this point we’ve checked out &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; and we’ve already obtained the current commit sha from &lt;code&gt;process.env&lt;/code&gt; in Step 1. With the commit sha we can now &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/git#get-a-commit&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;get the current commit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v16#git-get-commit&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;octokit.git.getCommit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which contains the hash of the &lt;code&gt;tree object&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;tree sha&lt;/code&gt;. With the &lt;code&gt;tree sha&lt;/code&gt; we can then &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/git#get-a-tree&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;get the tree object&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v16#git-get-tree&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;octokit.git.getTree&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a recursive parameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once we got the tree object, we then found the “tree node”(&lt;code&gt;srcTree&lt;/code&gt;) with our known &lt;code&gt;SNIPPET_PATH&lt;/code&gt;. It’s a tree node that represents the &lt;code&gt;snippet.js&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 5. Create a new Tree with modified content&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s summarize what we have so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have the new snippet from the public API hosted by FullStory, in string format&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have the source “tree node” that holds the content of the snippet from the current commit on the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next thing we need is to create a new &lt;code&gt;tree object&lt;/code&gt; with the new content (new snippet text). To do so we &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/git#create-a-tree&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;create a new tree&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with  &lt;a href=&quot;https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v16#git-create-tree&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;octokit.git.createTree&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and specify the updated object: our new snippet text. Remember that we’ve retrieved the original tree object recursively, meaning the tree object contains references to all the files with their nested paths. The new tree will contain all the information in the original tree, but update only what we need: the &lt;code&gt;snippet.js&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 6. Commit the change to a new branch&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that we have a new &lt;code&gt;tree object&lt;/code&gt; with updated snippet text, it’s simply a matter of committing the change and opening a PR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the current commit as parent, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/git#create-a-commit&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;create a new commit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v16#git-create-commit&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;octokit.git.createCommit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and pass in the created tree’s &lt;code&gt;tree sha&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/git#create-a-reference&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;create a new reference&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (branch) with the name: &lt;code&gt;snippetbot/updated-snippet-${Date.now()}&lt;/code&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v16#git-create-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;octokit.git.createRef&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, providing it the commit sha we just created:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Step 7. Open a PR and assign it to the maintainers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The final step is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/pulls#create-a-pull-request&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;create a PR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v16#pulls-create&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;octokit.pulls.create&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#add-assignees-to-an-issue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;assign it to the correct maintainers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the repo via &lt;a href=&quot;https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v16#issues-add-assignees&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;octokit.issues.addAssignees&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to get the correct assignees, we maintain a &lt;code&gt;MAINTAINERS.json&lt;/code&gt; file that contains all the maintainer’s GitHub handles for this repo, so the correct team members will be notified to review and merge the new PR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Results and closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With GitHub actions we were able to automate a process that would&amp;#x27;ve been cross-team, manual, and error prone. Our automation enables each team to operate independently, helps improve our productivity, and simplifies the process of maintaining the open source project for our Browser SDK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It also ensured that our consumers of the NPM package would have the latest version of our snippet to take advantage of any new features we release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Moreover, we now have a pattern for syncing our closed source code to the open source repos without depending on any human intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With this architecture, we’ve detected and merged several updates since it came online in December 2019, ensuring updated code for our Browser SDK users and reducing maintenance overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Check it out in action (and learn more about the FullStory Browser SDK) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/fullstory-browser-sdk&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[5 opportunities to optimize ecommerce experience and conversion]]></title><description><![CDATA[Optimization strategies for key touchpoints in the ecommerce customer experience, plus some real-world examples of ecommerce optimization in action.

Creating a great homepage experience &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A great ecommerce homepage serves three purposes: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduces your brand to first-time shoppers &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communicates what your company sells clearly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explains what differentiates you from your competitors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Beyond these foundations, the key to a highly effective homepage is understanding and catering to your shoppers’ intentions when they arrive at your site. The average &lt;a href=&quot;https://cxl.com/guides/bounce-rate/benchmarks/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ecommerce bounce rate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is nearly 46%–which is why it’s critical to anticipate your shoppers’ wants and needs from the start.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To get a sense of what it is that your shoppers are hoping to accomplish when they land on your homepage, leverage research methods like analyzing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/introducing-page-insights-with-click-maps-and-inspect-mode?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;click maps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=guide&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replays of user sessions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This qualitative data will help you understand how people are navigating your homepage, what they’re looking for (and if they’re finding it), and what site elements they’re engaging with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And those insights will reveal opportunities for optimization that your teams can act on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Optimizing site navigation &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your website’s header—including the navigation bar—is one of the most critical elements of your ecommerce experience. It has a major influence on how shoppers discover products, transition pages, and (as the name suggests) navigate through your site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As Shopify Plus wrote in their article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/ecommerce-navigation&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ecommerce navigation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Your shoppers don’t want to think as they browse...Design a header that is tailor-made to their wants and needs. It should be simple, clear, and most importantly, attractive to your visitors.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The catch is that every site’s navigation best practices are different, and what works for a big-box retailer might be very different from what works for a small ecommerce shop. There are infinite ways to organize and things to include on your header:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;contextual information about your brand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a list of product categories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a hamburger menu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a search bar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;An optimized header will enable shoppers to get where they want to go as easily as possible–and it’s important to keep in mind that what &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; think is most important might not be what your shoppers are primarily focused on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, an online retailer might display a magnifying glass in the header that users can click on to expand the search bar. By looking at heat maps, the brand can see that the magnifying glass is one of the most clicked elements, leading them to understand that their users want to use the search functionality. From there, the brand can then test a version of the homepage where the search bar is already fully displayed, rather than requiring that additional click to open it, and increase searches drastically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Simplifying product listings pages&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your product listings pages should make it as easy as possible for shoppers to locate what they’re looking for. This can be a delicate balance between making sure relevant products are highly discoverable but not overwhelming shoppers with disorganized selections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One best practice for product listings pages is to allow four key sorting options: Price, User Rating, Best-Selling, and Newest. According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://baymard.com/blog/essential-sort-types&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;usability study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Baymard Institute, the majority of shoppers commonly seek these essential sort types. However, 64% of ecommerce sites don’t allow all four types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Offering a robust sorting functionality allows shoppers to self-select the distractions they want to eliminate, making it easier for them to hone in on the product they’re interested in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Product detail page best practices&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each of the customer journey touchpoints we’ve discussed so far are critically important—but the product detail page (PDP) is perhaps the most vital, as it’s the page that leads directly to a conversion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;(While we’re mainly focused on product detail page best practices, it’s crucial to note the importance of having PDPs at all. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shiprocket.in/blog/product-page-optimization/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Shiprocket&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 98% of shoppers will abandon a site if they find incomplete or incorrect product information.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are some basic product details page best practices:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The item’s name is prominently displayed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product description is accurate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple high-quality images (eMarketer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emarketer.com/content/why-product-page-details-matter&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that shoppers expect five to eight)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product’s price is accurate and clearly displayed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CTA (i.e. Add to Cart) is easy to find&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep in mind that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/strategies-to-improve-checkout-flow-and-reduce-cart-abandonment?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;top reason for abandoned carts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is due to unexpectedly high additional costs, like shipping fees and taxes. Aim to be transparent about shipping costs up front to reduce abandonment rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. The ecommerce checkout experience &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The checkout page is the last place you want customers to encounter any sort of frustration or friction. In fact, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-consumer-survey?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory’s consumer survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 89% of US shoppers will leave a site after encountering even a single error in their ecommerce checkout experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are five essential tips for improving your checkout flow and reducing cart abandonment rates: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be transparent about shipping costs.&lt;/b&gt; Unexpected costs and fees are the top reason for shopping cart abandonment, according to Baymard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Add a progress indicator bar. &lt;/b&gt;Many shoppers will abandon a cart if they feel the checkout process is too long or tedious–so adding a simple progress indicator bar can help orient them in the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reduce “click energy.” &lt;/b&gt;Shoppers have a finite amount of click energy, and you don’t want them to run out before they get to the “Purchase” button. Make sure your checkout flow requires as few steps as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allow guest checkout. &lt;/b&gt;Being required to create an account to complete a purchase is the second most common cause of cart abandonments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conduct informed experiments with Session Replay insights. &lt;/b&gt;Seeing where users succeed and struggle in our checkout process by watching sessions is a great way to determine what types of A/B tests will generate valuable insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For even more actionable ecommerce insights and real world success stories, &lt;a href=&quot;https://experience.fullstory.com/retail/creating-delight-guide?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=guide&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;get the full guide to creating delightful ecommerce experiences&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why empathy is at the heart of our career development program]]></title><description><![CDATA[At FullStory, we believe in taking an empathy-first approach to career growth and development.

FullStory focuses on prioritizing the employee experience throughout the talent management process, ensuring that career development opportunities and exciting challenges are always within reach for FullStorians.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Recently, we’ve worked hard to put philosophies and processes in place that embrace the “new normal” of the hybrid workplace. In this blog series, we’ll outline how &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;our Watchwords&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; (Empathy, Clarity, and Bionics) inform our approach to career growth in an increasingly dynamic workforce.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why and how we focus on empathy in the workplace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why do humans work? It’s a big question. Huge, actually. There are entire fields of study dedicated to understanding the drivers of motivation and satisfaction at work (shout out to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;industrial &amp;amp; organizational psychology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fam!). Research in these fields aims to find generalizable patterns in human behavior and their complementary solutions that can be applied at scale to change the way we experience the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’ve been working for more than a few years, you’ve probably noticed the effects of these studies.* Innovative companies who apply the results of this research have vastly improved our collective experience of work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But like any macro solution, the trickle down effects can be hard to see or connect to your personal experience. Considering the uniquely personal aspect of career growth to each human in an organization, you can see how empathy must be central to any effective talent development program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;we define empathy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as caring to understand someone else’s perspective. This concept becomes important in nearly everything we do at work day to day, so it’s no surprise that we consider empathy to be a critical element of a healthy career development program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So how exactly does empathy show up when we’re talking about careers at FullStory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unpacking “career baggage” and building trust&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First, it’s helpful to note that we understand FullStorians are usually holding on to some career baggage from their previous job experiences–both good and bad. Promises may have been made and not kept, systems or processes may have been unfair or opaque, and you may be generally skeptical about the relationship between a company and your own growth. We therefore approach the question of growth with empathy, working to provide “the why” behind our talent development systems so that FullStorians can understand the company’s philosophy on career growth and begin to map that to their own experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That said, the unpacking process requires trust and, unfortunately, trust isn’t built overnight (our friends in IO &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smj.2198&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;have studied&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that, too). Often, an employee&amp;#x27;s ability and desire to trust a company is built through consistency, as the company keeps its promises, communicates transparently, and adheres to established processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Empathy plays a part in this process, as companies need to recognize and allow space for trust to build. Similarly, employees should strive to be cognizant of their own career baggage, and enter new roles with an outlook that isn’t colored by past work experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Managers and career growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Managers play a key role in unpacking career baggage and building trust. At FullStory, we think of our managers as force multipliers. They are there to clear the way for their teams, and to provide support and guidance to help their team meet business and professional goals. To that end, FullStory managers employ strategic 1:1s and regular career conversations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the heart of the manager-employee relationship is asking, “What’s now and what’s next?” In this vein, managers seek to uncover what’s important to each of their direct reports at this point in their career journey. Is it salary, title, new opportunities, or interesting and high impact work? Knowing the answers to these questions helps a manager tailor their approach and funnel the right types of opportunities to their team members to help them on their journey. An employee’s needs may shift over time, so continued conversations, active listening, and genuine curiosity must be hallmarks of manager and employee conversations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Empathy, now and forever&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we seek to empower and encourage employees to take charge of their career growth, and knowing what that means to each individual is the first step. Empathy has always played a central role in our company culture, and as we grow and FullStorians grow with us, we’re finding that this posture of empathy is key to our ability to provide meaningful and personalized career growth. In the next two posts, we’ll cover how Clarity and Bionics build upon this foundation of empathy and how it all relates to a distributed or remote workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interested in an empathetic approach to career growth?

The stakes are high, and brands must ensure they are meeting customer expectations by providing a seamless digital experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, QSR brands are often falling short. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-consumer-survey&quot;&gt;In a recent FullStory survey&lt;/a&gt; of 1,500 consumers, QSR brands were rated very low for quality of digital experiences provided to customers—with 38% saying their experience was “poor” or “very poor,” and only 7% providing a “very good” rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://thespoon.tech/survey-more-than-half-of-restaurant-sales-will-be-digital-by-2025/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital sales projected to make up more than half of all QSR sales by 2025&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, brands need to deliver seamless, differentiated digital experiences to keep pace with the competition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To help your brand excel in a market that’s becoming more digitally dominated every day, here’s a three-step approach to advance your digital experience and drive app adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Measure the end-to-end customer journey to deliver a seamless experience across channels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The onset of COVID-19 forced organizations to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smg.com/resources/detail/navigate-the-digital-transformation-without-compromising-on-cx&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;accelerate digital transformation efforts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and create more channels and touchpoints for customers to engage with their brand. But this uptick in cross-channel experiences introduced even more challenges for brands that were already struggling to provide a consistent experience across touchpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In FullStory’s study, 77% of consumers said they won’t complete their digital transaction if they encounter an error, and 60% won’t return to a business after they experience a problem. To uncover these digital barriers and close the gap on customer experiences, your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smg.com&quot;&gt;experience management (XM) program&lt;/a&gt; needs a healthy mix of active touchpoints (e.g., intercept surveys, micro surveys, post-engagement) and passive touchpoints (e.g., feedback buttons, chat) to ensure you’re measuring the entire customer journey from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, through the use of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smg.com/blog/blog-detail/smg-blog/2021/05/05/3-ways-to-enhance-your-digital-transformation-efforts-evolve-your-experience-management-program-with-diy-feedback&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;self-serve capabilities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can control what you ask and when you ask it. Real-time deployment by non-technical resources makes it easier to increase the footprint of feedback channels. This, in turn, greatly enhances your ability to identify points of friction, increase conversion, and provide seamless experiences across the journey. Plus, instead of looking at siloed engagements, you’ll get a holistic view, which will help you uncover issues faster and close the loop across channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Understand the full digital experience from the customer’s point of view—not your brand’s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Brands often make assumptions about the customer journey rather than defining that journey through &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; customer behavior. Remember: it’s the consumers who determine how they’ll interact with your brand and what they expect across channels. That’s why it’s imperative to understand the customer journey through the eyes of the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Uncovering &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; customers are experiencing in an automated and scalable way isn’t enough. You also need additional context to address the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; behind their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, &lt;u&gt;FullStory’s research revealed&lt;/u&gt; that 83% of respondents said a “good” digital experience simply means being able to “quickly accomplish what I came to do.” This is valuable information to have, but the crucial next step is understanding what a quick and efficient experience means to customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one way brands can quickly uncover customer needs and provide them with a speedy, efficient digital experience—helping you definitively answer the question, “What’s &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; happening on my site or app?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another way to streamline the feedback-to-insight process is through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smg.com/solutions/reporting-analytics/text-analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI-powered text analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Qualitative feedback provides invaluable insights behind quantitative data and answers questions you didn’t think to ask. With advanced features like sentiment and topic trends, regions impacted, and operational risk alerts, you’ll have the tools you need to turn open-ended feedback into digital improvements that lead to business-changing insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Drive engagement by creating a sound digital strategy focused on order accuracy and loyalty rewards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With insight into the &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; behind your customers’ experiences, the next step is action. Successful digital transformation is about reshaping experiences, not replacing them with novel touchpoints. The gap between what brands &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; customers want and what customers will &lt;i&gt;actually use&lt;/i&gt; is often filled with misplaced priorities and disappointing endeavors that fail to pay dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To get an idea of what consumers expect of their app experience, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smg.com/blog/blog-detail/smg-blog/2021/02/03/why-qsr-brands-must-invest-in-digital-engagement-mobile-app-ux-strategies-in-2021&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;SMG conducted a study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through our market intelligence tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smg.com/solutions/brand-research/market-intelligence&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;BrandGeek®&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We found that among the 40% of respondents who deleted an app in the last 30 days, nearly half did so because they didn’t use the app enough, and one in three cited difficulty placing orders or technical difficulties with the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, the study uncovered a big problem with inaccurate orders, with one in four consumers reporting they’ve experienced an issue with order accuracy when using a restaurant app. And this is impacting future behavior, with 40% of respondents who had difficulty placing an order indicating that they are not likely to place another app order in the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; keep them coming back? Loyalty rewards. Our study showed that 83% of respondents have at least one QSR app, and the top reason they cite for downloading the app is to earn loyalty rewards. Furthermore, when respondents were asked what they like most about their favorite app, the top response was the loyalty rewards program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To maximize your digital investments, provide a digital experience that delivers on order accuracy and rewards customers for their business. This will transform how customers engage with you, not just increase the number of engagements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Define digital transformation and chart the path for your brand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital disconnect can’t be solved with overreaching IT investments, futile branded apps, or a disjointed frontline staff—and it’s easy to confuse outdated ideas with innovative approaches. Brands that tackle this increasingly necessary adaptation the right way can optimize the technological offerings available to them and successfully enhance the digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital trends that guide your industry, your competitors, and your customers can help you chart the transformation path for your brand.

FullStory focuses on prioritizing the employee experience throughout the talent management process, ensuring that career development opportunities and exciting challenges are always within reach for FullStorians.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Recently, we’ve worked hard to put philosophies and processes in place that embrace the “new normal” of the hybrid workplace. In this blog series, we’ll outline how &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;our Watchwords&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; (Empathy, Clarity, and Bionics) inform our approach to career growth in an increasingly dynamic workforce.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Empathy and clarity are better together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When I was a hiring manager in Customer Success, I liked to ask candidates if they believed that the customer was always right. Many interviewees assumed I wanted to hear an emphatic “Yes!” But really, I wanted people to understand the difference between empathy and action. In other words, I wanted them to bring clarity into the equation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Clarity, by the FullStory definition, is the habit of thoroughly describing what you mean and why. Putting our empathy hats on, we can agree that a customer’s &lt;i&gt;feelings&lt;/i&gt; are always valid, as they are a byproduct of unique perspective and experiences. However, a customer’s past experience may not hold the answer to their problem, so the suggestions they make may not necessarily be “right.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And that’s why empathy must always pair with clarity. Once you&amp;#x27;ve cared to understand how someone is feeling, the next step is to get to the root of why they feel that way, so you can work toward a solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adding clarity to empathy for career growth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So how does this relate to career growth? As a Customer Success-turned-People Operations professional, I view the role of people operations as serving internal customers (aka FullStorians) to help them derive the most value from the product (aka the company). Getting clear on what the company does and does not offer in the way of career development helps employees map their needs to tangible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/career-development-at-fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the previous post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed how people seek different indicators of success at different stages in their career development. Leading with empathy allows space to have conversations with your manager about your dreams and goals. Adding clarity helps you to know exactly what outcome you may expect from that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3 examples of clarity in FullStory’s day-to-day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In relation to career development, clarity means providing a company perspective that helps people identify where their unique story fits in. Here are three ways FullStory provides clarity around career development:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Identifiable values and culture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Culture is hard to define, as it’s almost a feeling more than words. Rather than trying to build a culture that we&amp;#x27;ve defined, we reverse the order: We define our values, we talk about them often, and we let company culture spring forth from those guideposts. Our watchwords—empathy, clarity, bionics—form the basis of what we value in interacting with each other. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/about-us&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;operating principles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; act as a common language around how we work, make decisions, and collaborate together. When a company knows who they are and what they value, that intentionality and clarity seeps into your daily role and future opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; 2. &lt;b&gt;Stated career philosophy and vision&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory wants to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fullstory/status/1347257030625669120&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;launch careers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To make this a reality, we rely on a clear definition of growth that guides our talent programming: &lt;i&gt;We believe growth is centered around learning and challenge. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We seek to hire good people who delight in their craft, are lifelong learners, and who act as leaders regardless of their position or title. We contend that bringing these types of people together creates an environment where curiosity is nourished and professional development can occur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Transparent systems and processes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To support our definition of growth as learning and challenge, we strive to ensure that equitable systems are in place to provide timely recognition to FullStorians in the form of salary and title. To achieve this, we’ve found that consistency is the best way to build  trust and reduce surprises (aka, non-clarity). In that spirit, we conduct regular company wide reviews of total compensation and title, and we double-check those against market benchmarks and defined criteria specific to each role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Just like in any startup environment, rapid growth can make building a successful career development program feel like a moving target. In a post about clarity, it’s only fair to admit that we can’t tell FullStorians exactly what opportunities may be available to them in the next three to five years. There’s no way to know how much exciting growth or change FullStory will have experienced by then. But having a clearly defined vision and philosophy centered around growth, learning, and challenge helps FullStorians know that if they can imagine it, they can reach for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In our third and final post of the series, we’ll explore bionics, or how operational rhythms can be layered on to a foundation of empathy and clarity to produce very human career results at scale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking for some clarity in your career journey?

Quite a bit to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcasual.com/news/digital-orders-soar-during-pandemic/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fast Casual&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in 2020, online restaurant ordering hit record heights and hasn’t yet reached the summit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restaurant delivery orders grew a staggering 124% between March 2020 and March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital orders for carry-out, which represented 62% of all digital orders, increased by 130%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital orders for delivery grew by 140%, holding 38% share of total restaurant digital orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restaurant apps and websites were the most-used channels for digital ordering, representing 62% of all digital orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No matter the food, all those orders have one thing in common: each must pass the restaurant’s order form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why restaurant order forms are critical&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The online ordering form is the last hurdle between food in your customer’s hands and money on your bottom line. And, especially for large QSRs, it’s as much as a representation of your brand as the people making the food or taking orders—there’s no aspect of the process that should be left to chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;b&gt; It’s the place where orders get abandoned.&lt;/b&gt; According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-consumer-survey?&amp;amp;utm_source=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2021-06-15-comm-retail&amp;amp;utm_offer=blog&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory’s survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 77% of US consumers will leave a site after encountering even a single error in their digital experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One difficult form can prompt a visitor to go somewhere else entirely. Goodbye burritos, hello pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two ways to reduce restaurant form abandonment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ultimately, reducing form abandonment comes down to two elements:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Quantitative understanding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Numbers make the world go ‘round, and QSRs are no different. Whether it’s the final sales tally for the day or the operating costs listed in your quarterly financial reports, having reliable, quantitative metrics creates a solid baseline for change. After all, the first step to making change is knowing that change needs to happen in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To reduce restaurant form abandonment, a good place to start is an understanding of how many visitors attempt to order compared to how many actually make it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For more exacting insight, however, modern &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital experience intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tools can shine light on the thousands of UX decisions that compose a modern website or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Qualitative understanding&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The quantitative data analytics that surround your restaurant can be insightful, but still requires that you know what you want to measure, what questions you want to answer, and the path you think users will take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By diving into the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; behind those quantitative metrics, you’ll unearth rationale behind the metrics. For instance, a quantitative approach may help you learn that people are dropping off your order form when inputting pizza toppings. But without qualitative insights through digital intelligence like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you’d never understand why, for instance, customers were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online#rage-clicks&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rage Clicking&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on pepperoni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better Empathy, Less Form Abandonment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Essentially, reducing form abandonment is an exercise in empathy. You need to understand what’s driving your users to give up and abandon your form. To do that, you need clarity into their needs and expectations. And for that, you need to be empathetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the FullStory digital experience intelligence platform, QSRs can harness that empathy and adapt their practices at lightning speed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/digital-business-how-industries-adapted-dx-in-2020-and-beyond&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;meet consumers’ changing needs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/finding-dxi-signals-through-the-noise&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;find the signal through the noise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Keeping users’ heads in the game: Optimizing mobile sports betting apps ]]></title><description><![CDATA[By placing focus on optimizing betting user experience, organizations can keep users’ heads in the game. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/optimize-sports-betting-apps</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/optimize-sports-betting-apps</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In May 2021, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/05/20/14-months-into-the-pandemic-what-do-we-miss-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Columbia University&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled 1,200+ U.S. adults, asking them what they missed most throughout the past 14 months of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The answer? Large, in-person social gatherings—namely, &lt;i&gt;sports&lt;/i&gt;. It even outranked travel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sports has long been a passion for billions of people across the globe. But deregulation, coupled with the boundless power of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/mobile-apps&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;mobile apps&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has made sports betting just as much a part of the action as anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When bets can be placed anywhere, anytime, the action’s not exclusively on the field (or court, pitch, or rink).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why the global sports betting industry matters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Over the last 20 years, the global sports betting industry has picked up incredible momentum: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/467892/gross-gambling-yield-in-total-in-great-britain/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gross gambling yield (GGY) in Great Britain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; increased from roughly 8.4 billion British pounds in 2011 to approximately 14.4 billion British pounds in 2018—and it’s only grown in the years since. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sports betting has been legal in Nevada since 1949, the industry has seen rocketship growth after 2018, when sports wagering was derestricted nationwide. As of this writing, sports betting is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.americangaming.org/research/state-gaming-map/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;legalized in more than 15 states&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/1154681/key-data-global-sports-betting-industry/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;global sports betting industry&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reached a market size of $203 billion USD in 2020, and is poised to grow by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/-134-06-billion-growth-in-sports-betting-market-2020-2024--digital-revolution-to-emerge-as-key-trend--technavio-301240329.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;$134.06 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; USD by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports betting accounts for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/topics/1740/sports-betting/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;30-40%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of global gambling revenue, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sportsbettingdime.com/guides/finance/global-sports-betting-market/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;over 45%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of all sports bets are placed via mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Virtually all sports bettors have used an online sportsbook in the past year, and about half use an online sportsbook at least monthly,” said Adriana Waterston, senior vice president, Insights and Strategy, for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.horowitzresearch.com/press/new-research-highlights-opportunities-for-sports-betting/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Horowitz Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In so many words, sports betting is only getting larger, more mobile, and faster paced. With that much money in play, laser focus on reducing bugs and improving the sports betting experience can save millions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why is the mobile betting experience so important?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Initially, you might think the sports betting industry has a lot in common with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/how-ecomm-teams-succeed-with-complete-data&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ecommerce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After all, money is directly exchanged for a good, whether that’s a pair of shoes or a bet. But the similarities end there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While that pair of shoes will still be there tomorrow, the window of time for a sports bet is rapidly closing. Sports events happen once, then never again. This increases the pressure for mobile sports betting apps and services to execute perfectly and swiftly, each and every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When misfires happen, and when the user experience is threatened, the outcome can be declining trust, with thousands of dollars on the line per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;By placing focus on optimizing betting user experience, organizations can keep users’ heads in the game. Here’s how to make it happen:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4 Ways to optimize mobile betting user experiences&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Focus on navigation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;An app that isn’t obvious or intuitive to navigate will ultimately leave users frustrated. Many  users are trying to place time-sensitive bets during an event, which makes an intuitive navigation that much more critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your users don’t know how to place a bet within fractions of a second, they’ll give up. Every site or app’s navigation best practices are different, and what works for a big-box retailer might be very different from what works for your mobile betting app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And it’s more than just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/7-causes-of-bad-user-experiences&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;bad user experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—depending on your local regulations, site navigability may be a matter of legal compliance, where it can’t be easier to bet than withdraw money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Prioritize registration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once bettors learn how to bet, it’s critical that they stick around for a while. Just as ecommerce stores and many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/quick-service-restaurants-drive-apps-usage-and-sales&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;quick-service restaurants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; encourage registration—setting up an account, compared to staying a guest—sports gaming institutions should follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why? The lifetime value (LTV) of a non-registered user is dramatically lower than a registered user. Emphasis placed on this part of the betting process will pay dividends later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Enhance the checkout experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once users know how and where to place a bet, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059978234-Checkout-Funnel-Overview&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;checkout funnel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is likely the next area of opportunity. Cleanly defined as &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045159373-About-Funnels-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a series of actions you want an end-user to take&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a funnel differs from app to app and site to site, depending on industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For sports betting, an example funnel could be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate to betting page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Place bet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate to checkout page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Input payment information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate to payment completed page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each step of this process affords an opportunity to reduce friction. Investigate the entire user experience: buttons, text, navigability, and every other touchpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Put yourself (privately) in your users’ shoes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In so many words, sports betting is all about experience. Users need to feel enjoyment from the place where they’re betting, and also need to trust in what’s going on. &lt;b&gt;There’s a baseline expectation of a solid user experience.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;More than that, digital optimization technologies often play fast and loose with your users’ personally identifiable information (PII). &lt;b&gt;Ensure that any experience optimization technology on your app has &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/privacy-resources&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;privacy, security, and trust&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; baked in&lt;/b&gt; to prevent legal and ethical grey areas, and keep users returning for the next big game. 

&lt;b&gt;Ultimately, mobile sports betting organizations must focus on &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;digital experience intelligence (DXI)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; to eliminate friction points and keep users engaged.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By combining quantitative and qualitative data for comprehensive understanding, product teams at gaming organizations can perfect their apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[5 expert insights for a better ecommerce site experience ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Digital pros from three leading retailers share their best practices for building better ecommerce experiences. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/5-expert-insights-for-a-better-ecommerce-site-experience</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/5-expert-insights-for-a-better-ecommerce-site-experience</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kirsten Newbold-Knipp]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Delivering consumer delight (and revenue) with digital experience intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of all of the customers who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/why-customers-dont-come-back&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;abandon your ecommerce site&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for any reason, only 12% are very likely to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-consumer-survey&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;share feedback&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on why they left. That is &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; of valuable data slipping through the cracks. Leading retailers are harnessing that information—often through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital experience intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solutions—and using it to create better site experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I recently hosted a panel with &lt;a href=&quot;https://commercenext.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;CommerceNext&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and asked three ecommerce experts to share their best practices for making data-driven decisions to improve the ecommerce site experience. I was so pleased to have a panel of smart, opinionated leaders to guide our conversation, including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Schultz, AVP - Ecommerce Product Management &amp;amp; Web Operations, Ann Taylor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Powell, Chief Technology Officer, FTD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Urban, VP Ecommerce, Urban Digital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allan Dick, Co-Founder, CommerceNext (Moderator)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
I’ve compiled the most critical insights and data points from our conversation into this quick read, but if you want to see the full webinar, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bigmarker.com/commercenext/Webinar45#&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;you can access it here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Even post-pandemic, digital isn’t going anywhere&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before we get started, here’s why it’s never been more important to provide a great ecommerce experience: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory recently conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-consumer-survey&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consumer survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which we found that &lt;b&gt;81% of consumers plan to maintain or increase their online usage&lt;/b&gt; even after in-person activities fully resume. Consumers have come to expect a certain level of digital service over the past year, and meeting those expectations will only become more important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And 64% of consumers say they’ve been frustrated or struggled online in the last six months, citing page glitches as the most frustrating issue they encounter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, if we know all of this, what’s stopping retailers from acting? Many brands &lt;b&gt;simply don’t have access to the data necessary to understand their complete customer experience&lt;/b&gt;. Which is detrimental to revenue, as one in three customers will walk away from a brand they &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; after just &lt;b&gt;one bad experience. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are the panel’s insights on how to overcome these challenges and improve site experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Democratize your data &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Democratized data—which allows your teams direct access to the data they need to do their jobs—is key to accelerating your digital transformation. Without clarity and unified access, digital teams can’t understand the customer journey (and its problems) at scale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, Matt Powell’s team at FTD thinks of their data in two buckets: success metrics and diagnostic metrics. Success metrics include big picture data like LTV and NPS, which layer with granular diagnostic metrics associated with day to day operations. Making these two types of data readily accessible to the appropriate teams is key to driving results aligned with the full customer lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Capturing data through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/privacy-resources&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;privacy-focused methods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; empowers retailers to make the most of first-party data insights &lt;b&gt;while protecting consumers. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Think about the customer journey from all angles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The moment a customer converts is, of course, a focal point for ecommerce pros—but it’s equally important to pay close attention to the pre- and post-sale experience. In an age when customer loyalty is difficult to earn, ensuring that the customer journey is seamless from homepage to delivery is table stakes for ecommerce brands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As Ann Taylor’s Sarah Schults points out, while digital pros think of the customer journey in terms of buckets like pre-sale and post-sale, the customer doesn’t make these distinctions. Shoppers think about their experience with your company as a whole—and one bad piece cancels out all of the good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Let creativity and data work together&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many businesses struggle with the concept of art versus science—or creativity/branding versus data—where the two are seen as adverse elements in a company. Our panel contends that, in reality, this tension doesn’t need to exist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Ann Taylor team tackled this challenge by making organizational changes that allow for more balance between merchandising and brand to ensure both short and long term business goals are met. According to Sarah Schultz, a successful site combines transactional elements with branding to create a balanced experience—but that mix should be supported by data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the same ways data and testing can inform how transactional elements should appear on a page, different types of data can help you understand how to best use creative elements on a page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. In the checkout flow, keep things simple&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There was a time in the not-too-distant past when putting all available options on a checkout page was a best practice, because it gave the customer a sense of power. Today, consumers are constantly bombarded by choices, and more options aren’t always better in the ecommerce checkout flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In fact, in our recent consumer survey, 83% of shoppers say that a “good” site experience simply means being able to quickly accomplish what they came to do—not fancy bells and whistles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, all of our panelists agreed that a checkout page should offer no more than three payment options (such as credit card, PayPal, and Klarna)—but that ultimately, these decisions should be driven by your ecommerce store’s unique DX data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/optimize-ecommerce-experience-and-conversion&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;keeping your checkout process streamlined&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can reduce decision fatigue and save customers’ click energy—making them more likely to get across the checkout finish line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Find the “unknown unknowns”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first rule of site experience is that you can’t fix what you don’t know is broken. We often hear from our customers that FullStory answers questions they didn’t know to ask—and therefore reveals issues they didn’t know existed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But how do you uncover that data? While traditional site experimentation should begin with a hypothesis, our panel recommends that looking at your DX data &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; a question or assumption can reveal hidden truths that you might otherwise have been blind to. Do you see any anomalies in your data? Does anything surprise you? Those are your unknown unknowns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 5 dashboards that product management teams should be using]]></title><description><![CDATA[Build these five product management dashboards for truthful, at-a-glance information to get stuff done. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/5-product-management-dashboards</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/5-product-management-dashboards</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Stephanie Mercer]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newscientist.com/article/2268810-perseverance-rover-has-sent-back-stunning-video-and-audio-from-mars/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Perseverance rover&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; touched down on Mars in early 2021, the team back on Earth was bombarded with an incredible 30 gigabytes of information in just a few moments’ time. But they took it in stride. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Instead of manually parsing thousands of data files, they had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIooAx_GkJs&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;extensive dashboards&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; telling them what they needed to know at a glance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s a similarity there about modern web tools: the more detailed and complex the information that’s being conveyed, the simpler dashboards need to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While your product management team isn’t &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; going to Mars, you’re still reliant on truthful, at-a-glance information to get stuff done. Enter: product dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is a product dashboard? What can it monitor?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Essentially, dashboards take a broad array of data and present it in a way that addresses the questions you and your team have. Whatever the platform—Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a Digital Experience Intelligence platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—dashboards make it easy to answer questions about specific KPIs and monitor them for trends or anomalies over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050058893-Dashboards-Overview&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory dashboards&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; take the rich, detailed data used to recreate your end-user’s sessions and output high-level snapshots on projects, monitor issues and identify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/mobile-app-trends&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;trends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, FullStory dashboards can also link these visualizations to matching sessions, so you can seamlessly navigate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replays&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; without ever having to run a follow-up search. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;More narrowly, what can dashboards monitor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A single metric &lt;/b&gt;to help you clearly understand your progress toward (or ability to maintain) a single KPI, such as number of clicks on a new feature to signal adoption.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A metric trend &lt;/b&gt;to visualize over time for multiple groups, such as visits to a specific page by different segments of users.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A dimensionality &lt;/b&gt;to understand if a specific condition or location is contributing outsized impact—for instance, that most error clicks on a page are coming from one browser.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Funnels and Conversions &lt;/b&gt;to provide a health snapshot of an important journey, such as whether users are finding their way from a new feature to a checkout page the way you hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The five dashboards product teams should build&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a member of the FullStory consulting services team, I have the pleasure of talking to power users every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In working with the “mission control operators” of some of the world’s best websites and apps, I’ve noticed a trend of five important questions (and their corresponding dashboards) each of these teams use to monitor and drive their work:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Where is our digital experience falling short? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;NPS is a popular way to measure customer satisfaction, but you can also leverage dashboards within your tools to identify trends and match them to the corresponding session. Sample metrics may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total surveys shown, completed, or abandoned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top responses to specific survey questions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to complete survey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys served per page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Where are users experiencing frustration? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watching session replays can uncover specific issues causing friction for your users, but what if they’re impacting more than one user?

How are users interacting with our content? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A holistic overview of traffic, journeys, and interactions is available in many popular analytics tools already in use. But capturing this information in the context of the user experience can provide an invaluable opportunity to deepen your learning with insights around:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total traffic (and by device, browser, and OS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top referrers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top clicked navigation elements or elements overall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Percent of users by scroll depth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Percent of users engaging with &amp;quot;Help&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completion rate for a desired path&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4.

How are new features working? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A combination of the frustration, engagement, and performance metrics available to be monitored can provide unique perspective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total clicks on a new button&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Percent of users clicking on a new button&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversion rate after clicking on a new button&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Error clicks on a new button&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re not getting the detail your team needs at a glance—and you’re not yet using FullStory—let’s chat.

You’re on point this week for resolving customer-facing bugs, so armed with your favorite caffeinated beverage—it’s coffee; your favorite caffeinated beverage is coffee—you grab the top item from the queue and get to work. After a frustrating hour where you utter “this should work” more often than you’d care to admit, you finally nail down the root cause (“oh right, this should not, in fact, work”). You commit some code and let the customer support team know a fix is on the way. Out of curiosity, you ask which customer was being affected by this bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Uh.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Someone is typing…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Okay, so, they’re not actually a customer. They were trialing our software but didn’t convert. They haven’t signed on in weeks. This item shouldn’t have been in your queue. Really sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You glance at the next item in the queue and decide it’s best to take an early lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Leverage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s talk about the abstraction layer between customers and engineers, which contains systems and processes that fundamentally affect the productivity of everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Product companies design software to support customers at scale. As much as possible, our intention is for customers to succeed without needing to reach out to a human. The software is intuitive and usable. It just works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But sometimes the software is a bit confusing, or there’s a bug, so we have systems like customer support teams and online documentation to help unblock customers and get them on their way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If everything is working well, engineering teams can focus on designing solutions that serve all customers, not just the needs of one particular customer. If you find yourself drowning in the problems of individual customers, that can be a sign of an unhealthy organization, namely, that your product doesn’t support customers at scale. Conversely, it can also be a sign of &lt;i&gt;success&lt;/i&gt; at scale—perhaps you’ve acquired so many customers that a very small percentage of them have problems. Behind that small percentage are discrete individual customers who need the attention of the product engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The process for escalating customer issues to engineering teams contains a great deal of leverage. We saw an example of &lt;i&gt;negative&lt;/i&gt; leverage at the beginning of this post. Poor processes can lead to queues of nebulous importance, which increase the chances of working on the wrong thing. Not fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory’s support engineering and product engineering teams worked together over the past year to overhaul our customer escalation process to provide &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt; leverage, improving how we stay in sync, standardizing how we escalate issues, and automating processes to be more bionic. What follows is our recommendation for improving your customer escalation abstraction layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get in sync&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we tend to be fairly averse to standing meetings, preferring to communicate asynchronously as much as possible. In the case of customer escalations, where the process necessarily crosses team boundaries, a weekly meeting adds a great deal of leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;My advice: don’t overthink it. Put a recurring event on the calendar to review the customer escalation backlog. Keep a running agenda and spend the time talking about what is directly affecting customers. You’ll find that the process of connecting weekly immediately increases the level of empathy and clarity in communication between teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why does the meeting add so much leverage? When a company is small, teams don’t need as much structure and process—you can stay in sync just by working closely on the same set of problems every day.  As companies and teams grow, the systems to communicate across team boundaries aren’t as robust as the internal systems that emerge from within teams. Meetings are a way to immediately increase the flow of information between teams while the processes and systems that connect different teams mature and develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Standardize the Escalation Template&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are two ways to escalate the same issue:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What’s going on here? Is this a bug?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Take a look at the reproduction steps below. The error at the end is unexpected. Can you determine if the error is caused by our code or the customer’s code? The issue is relatively low priority for the customer, but they would appreciate knowing if the error is on their end. If the error is on our end, we can add the issue to our backlog, but it wouldn’t need to be fixed immediately.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The difference is stark. Engineers risk wasting time working on customer issues (and non-issues) when it’s unclear what is being asked of them. This wastes time and valuable engineering resources. By standardizing the escalation template, engineers can narrow their focus on the specific problem at hand, increasing the amount of time available to serve other customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve broken down our escalation template into several sections:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is our clear ask for engineering?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is the most important part—in one or two sentences, summarize what support is asking from engineering. An engineer should be able to read this section and immediately know what’s being asked of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;What’s happened so far?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Describe in plain language what the customer has experienced, referencing existing internal and external communication that may be in play. This is where you link out to support tickets and Slack threads. For complex issues, it’s extremely helpful to create a paper trail of internal and customer-facing conversations that have already happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steps to Reproduce the Problem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sometimes we can just include a FullStory session link, but for more complex issues, it helps to spell out the exact reproduction steps along with &lt;i&gt;Expected&lt;/i&gt; vs &lt;i&gt;Actual&lt;/i&gt; outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who is the customer?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Provide the customer’s name and some signal about their relationship with you. We use the customer’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) dollar value as a proxy for customer size. This humanizes the escalation and reminds engineering that the issue is affecting a person or team at a real company and isn’t merely a technical problem to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is the business impact?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Describe in plain language how the issue is impacting the customer. This provides an additional opportunity for empathy as well as a signal that can help with prioritization when viewing escalations collectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With highly technical escalations, it’s not always clear what engineering needs to do. Being consistently clear in this area can go a long way to ensure engineers aren’t wasting cycles on unnecessary work and customers are getting the answers they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bionics - put the system into action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Setting up recurring meetings and improving the quality and consistency of our escalations are the highest leverage changes you can make to improve the escalation process. These two changes will get you 80% of the way there. If you’d like to go the extra mile, you can start automating the systems that have begun adding leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Automate the escalation process&lt;/b&gt;. Most help desk solutions provide a way to create macros, snippets, or saved replies. You can use these structured text “forms” as the start of the escalation process. By using the APIs between your help desk and bug tracking system—we leaned heavily on Zapier to connect Zendesk and Clubhouse—you can ensure information is consistent and processes are efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlight important information&lt;/b&gt;. With automation, you get to choose which information stands out. For us, that meant including the customer name and ARR directly in the title of the escalation. ARR isn’t the only driver of prioritization—we build a product that scales to serve all customers—but it &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; give us an approximation for customer size. For complex issues that affect multiple customers, we generate an HTML table of all customers and their ARR, summing up the total number of customers and ARR and including that in the title of the escalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structure the escalation backlog to serve as a meeting agenda&lt;/b&gt;. You’ll find that when your escalation process is consistent and important information stands out, it’s much easier to identify what’s important and needs to be prioritized. This naturally leads to your backlog being able to serve as a meeting agenda. As a bonus, you can start leaving meeting notes directly in the escalations themselves, eliminating the need to keep track of escalation notes in multiple places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One backlog to rule them all&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Improving the escalation process between support engineers and product engineers creates a healthy gravitational pull whereby you start wishing escalations from &lt;i&gt;other &lt;/i&gt;teams followed the same process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, sales deals are often driven by a high sense of urgency, which usually means communication happens quickly over Slack, frequently lacking the level of detail that you would find in a standardized escalation workflow. This can be okay—there’s a benefit to allowing for a healthy dose of urgency—but these drive-by escalations also have a tendency to fall through the cracks as threads become inactive and people move on to the next urgent-but-maybe-not-important task. For issues that can’t be immediately resolved, support engineers can route these conversations through the standard escalation process to make sure engineers have the information they need to tackle and prioritize issues on a longer time horizon. This ensures issues don&amp;#x27;t fall through the cracks as our collective Slack memory fades when threads become inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every successful product and engineering organization is going to face the challenge of prioritizing individual customer escalations. By improving the processes that serve as the interface between customers and engineering teams, customers get the information they need faster and engineers can spend more time working on solutions that scale to serve all customers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bionics that foster career development at scale]]></title><description><![CDATA[A regular rhythm of business strategy that all employees can see and follow along with provides structured opportunities for growth and challenge.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/bionics-foster-career-development-at-scale</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/bionics-foster-career-development-at-scale</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Jaclyn Spangler]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;At FullStory, we believe that a more perfect digital experience benefits everyone, and helps our customers drive user happiness and loyalty.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;We take the same approach to our employee experience, following the belief that satisfaction at work benefits both our employees and our business. FullStory focuses on prioritizing the employee experience throughout the talent management process, ensuring that career development opportunities and exciting challenges are always within reach for FullStorians.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Recently, we’ve worked hard to put philosophies and processes in place that embrace the “new normal” of the hybrid workplace. In this blog series, we’ll outline how &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;our Watchwords&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; (Empathy, Clarity, and Bionics) inform our approach to career growth in an increasingly dynamic workforce.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The bionic effect of patterns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This week is Listening &amp;amp; Alignment week at FullStory. In the past, we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/listening-and-alignment-at-fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;written about L&amp;amp;A week&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the many ways it helps the whole company zoom out and reset each quarter. But would you believe L&amp;amp;A week is also an integral part of our career development program? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;L&amp;amp;A week is part of the FullStory operational cadence, which centers around Objectives &amp;amp; Key Results (OKRs). The OKR cycle is oriented around our fiscal year. At the beginning of the year, we set company-wide annual goals, and then we break these down into quarterly, department-centric goals that can be achieved one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Starting with this skeleton of a quarterly rhythm allows us to flesh out the remainder of the year with predictable programming. For example, we know the first two weeks of each quarter will be set aside for strategy, planning, and reconnection, starting with Company Kickoff in February and followed by L&amp;amp;A Week each of the remaining 3 quarters. The majority of the time in between is dedicated to the work required to meet the outlined objectives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Being able to understand the patterns of a quarter provides the ability to maximize the impact of other programming, thereby making it all more &lt;i&gt;bionic&lt;/i&gt; (a word defined at FullStory as “human quality at superhuman scale”).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/clarity-and-career-development-at-fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;previous post about clarity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we introduced the idea of transparent systems and processes, such as clearly defined career levels. Not only does this clarity build trust, it also allows for the system to scale as a company grows. However, even the clearest and most empathetic career levels documentation is rendered moot if there is no process cadence in place that encourages their use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How we use operational rhythm to bionicize career growth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When considering career development, having a regular rhythm of business strategy that all employees can see and follow along with provides structured opportunities for growth and challenge. Let’s look at a few examples of how predictable processes support goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your goal: High impact work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Leadership articulates the highest level strategic priorities for the company using OKRs every quarter. If working on high impact projects is a personal development goal, OKRs serve as a repository of important work you could get involved in, and let you see  when in the quarter is a good time to raise your hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your goal: Level up to the next title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our performance review cycle, affectionately termed #FullStoryAF (Accomplishments &amp;amp; Feedback), happens twice a year. Although you’re likely touching on progress, performance, and aspirations with your manager in your regular 1:1s, the #FullStoryAF cycle designates  two times each year when you can really dig into these topics and talk about what’s next. These conversations, which are when level ups occur, land in mid-Q2 and mid-Q4, making space for the natural pushes of strategic planning and programming that occur in Q1 and Q3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Company goal: Ensure equity &amp;amp; fairness for all FullStorians &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;People Ops gathers data each quarter that helps leadership make evidence-based decisions in future quarters. Data comes in from many sources—Pulse surveys, onboarding surveys, exit interviews, employee performance reviews, and hiring stats. Since the programs that collect this data are regularly scheduled throughout the year, we can be more rigorous in our data analysis and make fewer ad-hoc decisions about priorities for the future. We can also hold ourselves accountable each quarter to meeting any targets that have been set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using the operational patterns of a company as useful constraints can help to amplify people processes that may otherwise become overly burdensome (or worse, ignored!) during busy times of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As the previous two posts explored, the pairing of empathy with clarity in any company’s career development program is crucial. Without empathy, we allow our own perspective to color our decisions. Without clarity, we become reactive, trying to solve for each nuanced perspective separately. Layering on bionics creates a regular rhythm for these cultural ideals to be reinforced and, ultimately, to scale the human experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interested in a career full of empathy, clarity, and bionics?

It’s been called &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldxo.org/is-nps-bad-for-you/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;harmful&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, misused and been accused of tracking the wrong metrics. Conversely, it’s also been held in high esteem as the way that companies can truly understand how customers feel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good or bad, the utility of a net promoter score isn’t just a succinct number of happy customers. It’s about what actions teams can take with that net promoter score.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s look at how and why product teams can use NPS to gain valuable insights on customers, and how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) tools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can build upon those surveys and their output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is a Net Promoter Score (NPS)?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a succinct measurement of how likely a customer is to hype your product. It gives you some signal for how much word-of-mouth will play into your go-to-market strategy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But if you&amp;#x27;re trying to deeply understand your digital customer experience, an NPS survey might come up slightly short by lacking detail on &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; a customer is feeling one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With NPS, your customer is either a promoter, a passive, or a detractor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;​​Promoters&lt;/b&gt;: 9–10 score ratings. They love your brand and are very likely to recommend you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Passives&lt;/b&gt;: 7–8 score ratings. They don’t spread positivity or negativity about your brand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detractors&lt;/b&gt;: 0–6 score ratings. They are unhappy with your brand and are likely to tell the world that they dislike you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One swift way to add clarity to these categories: &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055592234-Productboard&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;add a comment field to your NPS survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The quantitative score itself might be most related to a customer’s interest in recommending you, but the qualitative feedback gathered from customer comments can offer clues into your product and its digital customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Diving deeper into quantitative and qualitative results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So you’ve launched an NPS survey, and results are coming in two related—but ultimately separate—buckets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quantitative NPS survey results themselves (typically, a 1–10 scale)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The qualitative comments associated with the results (an open-ended response)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With both in hand, how should product teams transform results into action items that will improve customer satisfaction and retention? Parsing exact action items and prioritization from a series of disconnected survey results can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;To find action items and prioritize survey results, product teams need a &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital experience intelligence (DXI) platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; like FullStory. &lt;/b&gt;A robust DXI platform can give product teams the opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get the qualitative context around interesting customer comments—whether good or bad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantify impact regarding how specific changes affect your bottom line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get total clarity into &lt;i&gt;what onsite or in-app actions led up to&lt;/i&gt; a user’s final verdict&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adding DXI to NPS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leading DXI solutions such as FullStory are uniquely positioned to assist product teams by layering on top of NPS surveys,&lt;/b&gt; offering detail that would have been impossible to surface otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If an NPS survey yields a quantitative result on a scale of 1 to 10, and additional comments to the survey touch into the qualitative results, DXI can help product teams &lt;i&gt;actually see what yielded those results in the first place.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;searching for recent sessions and replaying them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, teams can focus on sessions conducted by the customer who submitted the feedback and the area in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With this added insight, an educated guess can be made as to what caused the complaint—maybe a button that should have worked but didn’t, resulting in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—or a general error with website or mobile app usability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DXI solutions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; give teams much-needed context—the kind needed to make sense of an otherwise alarming-but-ambiguous comment from an NPS survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Triage opportunities for improvements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After you&amp;#x27;ve had a chance to investigate user issues that arose in NPS survey results, &lt;b&gt;the next step is to triage them to prioritize fixes and enhancements.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next question to ask: How many customers experienced a similar problem?

Jump down below for more specific technical information, but first it’s worth asking: why did we invest in building emulators? Why should you buy into this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why Emulators?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’ll define an emulator as a piece of software that runs on your local development and Continuous Integration (CI) stack and emulates the behavior of a cloud service. Here are just a few reasons, which I’ll break down in more detail:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run a self-contained local development environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid needlessly abstracting the storage layer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test the storage layer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write fewer mocks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easier than you think&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reason 1: Run a self-contained local development environment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we’re extremely passionate about engineer productivity. We have very low tolerance for anything that causes frustration in the development process. From the earliest days, we have always worked to ensure that our entire product can run directly on engineers’ laptops. We consider this a vital part of engineering productivity. Most of our work, even tricky integration work, can be tested out locally before our code is merged or deployed even to staging. And we don’t need a network connection or managed cloud services configured per engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Emulators fill a vital gap in our local stack. We write live code against online storage systems like Datastore, Bigtable, or GCS. That code needs to do something useful in local dev— ideally, that code would behave just like the real online storage systems, and even persist our local data onto disk and maintain state across builds, restarts, and reboots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reason 2: Avoid needlessly abstracting the storage layer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sometimes it makes sense to abstract the storage layer in your live code. Sometimes it doesn’t. The abstraction might just add complexity and lines of code to what would otherwise be very simple. Either way, shouldn’t that decision hinge mostly on the live code? Abstracting a storage layer makes sense in many circumstances, but it doesn’t feel good to be forced into the decision by your test code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Emulators let you run the most straightforward live code in an isolated environment. Service authors simply write code against the real storage service APIs, making emulators extremely high leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reason 3: Test the storage layer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s say, for the sake of cleanliness, you went ahead and abstracted out your storage layer. Now you have a different problem. You can test your app code using mocks, but how do you test &lt;i&gt;the storage layer itself&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By definition, your storage layer implementation needs to talk to a real online service— but you can’t easily connect to these services from a local development environment or CI system. The logic between your app and storage might be perfect, but if your storage layer has a bug, you’re unlikely to discover it prior to deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Emulators let you test your storage layer against a service that’s as close to a real system as you can get. While an emulator can never be perfect, at least you can fix bugs and add new emulator features in a single place. With an open source emulator, we can do this for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reason 4: Write fewer mocks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Remember how I just mentioned “mock out the storage layer” when unit testing app code? Mocks are a wonderful testing tool, but they come with several downsides:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mocks can be wrong and give you a false sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mock implementations are frequently copied around rather than reused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in the best case, mocks create conceptual overhead and add lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reason 5: It’s easier than you think&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many online storage systems have relatively simple interfaces and behavior. The facade of what services like Bigtable or Storage do isn’t all that complicated. The real value that these services provide usually boils down to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Availability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Durability / Replication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ease of use / management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If all you need from a data service is to run with reasonable uptime and durability on the local machine and store no more than a few MB or GB of data, the hard parts of the problem kind of fall away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google Bigtable Emulator&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our Google Bigtable Emulator is a fork of Google’s own &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/go/docs/reference/cloud.google.com/go/bigtable/latest/bttest&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;bigtable/bttest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent in-memory Bigtable emulator that works very well for unit tests. So why did we fork it? In a word: persistence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory is an extremely data-driven product. It’s difficult to work on the product if you have no data to work with. The ability to enable on-disk persistence is an absolute must for our storage emulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what did we do? We took the existing &lt;code&gt;bttest&lt;/code&gt; implementation and abstracted out a storage layer interface. (A tad ironic if you&amp;#x27;ve been reading with me up to now! 😆 ) Then we brought in the Go implementation of Level DB (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;syndtr/goleveldb&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to serve as a backing store. This library is nice for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a lexically ordered key-value store like bigtable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It supports very efficient seeks and scans, necessary to support the bigtable API&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It offers both in-memory and on-disk implementations out of the box&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There was just one significant complication: the existing &lt;code&gt;bttest&lt;/code&gt; code was written in terms of bespoke Go structs to represent tables, rows, columns, and cells. These structs could not be easily serialized, and even contained mutexes. We ended up replacing these structs by using the real &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/reference/data/rpc/google.bigtable.v2&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bigtable public proto objects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which natively serialize. We also had to rework the concurrency model entirely, since the old model relied on internal mutexes within objects stored in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I would have liked to upstream our changes to Google rather than fork, but unfortunately the changes were significant enough that the Google engineers are understandably hesitant to integrate them into the mainline. Still, I was able to get several bug fixes committed to the upstream along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read up on how to get started and more technical details &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/emulators#google-bigtable-emulator&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Emulator&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our GCS emulator is probably one of the oldest emulators at FullStory. It was written from scratch many years ago, has been improved by multiple engineers, and has been rewritten a couple of times in its life. With persistence enabled, the emulator stores files directly to disk within its data directory. Helpfully, the emulator stores files on-disk at predictable paths that match the virtual GCS file system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, for example, a file in bucket &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; named &lt;code&gt;some/path/tofile&lt;/code&gt; would exist on the local disk at &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;data_dir&amp;gt;/foo/some/path/tofile&lt;/code&gt;. This makes it super easy to inspect your GCS data locally using normal filesystem tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We haven’t implemented every advanced GCS feature, but we have a lot of them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metadata&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most conditionals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read up on how to get started and more technical details &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/emulators#google-cloud-storage-emulator&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Go vs. Other Languages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’re a Go shop, and the emulators are written in Go. It’s going to be easier to get up and running on Go, and the emulators can be run in-process (awesome for unit tests). However, you can still run the emulators as external services. (For example, we run redis and memcache out of process during our own Go unit tests, and you can easily do the same with our emulators.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The important thing is to intercept the outbound requests: HTTP (for GCS) or GRPC (for bigtable). These need to be re-routed to the loopback address and port that the emulator is running on. For Go clients, we’ve already paved the way for you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/emulators#connecting-to-the-bigtable-emulator-from-go&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bigtable client setup&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fullstorydev/emulators#connecting-to-the-gcs-emulator-from-go&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;GCS client setup&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When writing Go unit tests, I suggest you use &lt;code&gt;TestMain&lt;/code&gt; to set up and tear down the emulators you need on a package by package basis. Go tests run a package at a time. Setting up and tearing down emulators for every test method is probably wasted effort. You only need to ensure that the unit tests within a single package don’t interfere with each other’s expectations about the state of the underlying data. Having each test operate on its own data set is an easy way to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Testing our own Emulators&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do we know that our emulators behave correctly? Or, to put it another way— how can we verify that our emulator test cases have the right expectations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We put a bit of extra effort to formulate all our test code in such a way that most of our test cases are runnable against the real service. Both the Bigtable and GCS emulators have a file named &lt;code&gt;remote_test.go&lt;/code&gt; that allows us to run most of our test suite against real production instances Bigtable and GCS, respectively. We can be pretty confident that we wrote the test cases correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I hope you find these tools as useful as we have.

Increasingly, the path to purchase isn’t just spanning mobile and desktop, but digital, and in-store experiences.

Optimizing mobile apps for speed &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consumers today have exceptionally high standards for a mobile experience. Google reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-ca/advertising-channels/mobile/mobile-site-speed-importance/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;54% percent of people say that as the load time for a brand’s mobile site increases, so does their frustration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speed matters, but how fast is fast enough? Ecommerce companies should aim to load their site or mobile app in 3 seconds or faster. But, don&amp;#x27;t stop there. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Shoppers who visit fast websites aren&amp;#x27;t just more likely to convert; they&amp;#x27;re more likely to browse and add additional products to their orders—indicative of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customer-story/ecommerce-retail&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a shopping experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that customers love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some causes of slowness are out of your control. You can&amp;#x27;t control whether a shopper is connected to a good Wi-Fi network or whether they&amp;#x27;re on the go. While considering user connection speeds might feel like an edge-case, it&amp;#x27;s best to optimize your website (and mobile) to load quickly even when network speed is less than ideal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Leading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-intelligence-features-for-complete-dx-data/&quot;&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence solutions&lt;/a&gt; such as FullStory leverage a range of methods to avoid sending up data when nothing is changing on-screen, making the impact on idle bandwidth very small. The data requirements are low enough that application developers can enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recordings for all users, including those on cellular networks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using a DXI solution only logs data if the user is interacting with the application and on-screen elements are changing, which has a minimal impact on the mobile device’s battery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Creating a frictionless ecommerce experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Any friction in your mobile experience will increase the likelihood that a user will bounce from your app. Research indicates that &lt;a href=&quot;https://uplandsoftware.com/localytics/resources/blog/25-of-users-abandon-apps-after-one-use/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;25% of users will only open an app once&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so reliably delivering a good digital experience for new users isn’t optional—it’s mandatory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to user experience in mobile apps, some common causes of friction include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many steps, especially during initial app setup or onboarding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many form fields&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much time “spinning” or waiting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;User research is one way to uncover points of friction in your app, as are &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058890254-Creating-a-Funnel&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;funnels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly identify where users are dropping off points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many leading Digital Experience Intelligence platforms offer a series of useful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with other critical pieces of your tech stack, including Jira, Trello, and Slack. When all details about the customer&amp;#x27;s session are logged in advance, problems can be resolved faster and easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customer-story/ecommerce-retail/carvana&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read how Carvana optimizes critical features using a powerful DXI solution, without sacrificing site performance.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3.

If you&amp;#x27;re sending promotions to customers via email, it&amp;#x27;s most likely that they&amp;#x27;ll open it on their phone, which means that their email click-throughs are likely going to be happening on mobile, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hard-earned email clicks shouldn’t go to waste because of the mobile experience. The key to being able to optimize your mobile customer experience for your e-commerce business is having the power to understand it from the perspective of individual customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Digital Experience Intelligence platform can help you gain a complete picture of how customers interact with your site or app, no matter the device, and eliminate uncertainty. Stop wondering and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/ecommerce-trends-2021&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;understand the mobile experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through the lens of your customer’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mobile has been solidified as an integral piece of customers experience brands—whether on the web, in-store or on mobile apps.

It ran on 2G wireless, was only available through AT&amp;amp;T, had no App Store, and couldn’t send (its comparatively poor quality) photos via text message. Still, it was the cutting edge of mobile, and sold over 12 million devices in its first two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, with Siri, Portrait Mode, iCloud, and face recognition at our fingertips, the first-generation iPhone seems almost primitive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While mobile devices have come a long way in the last decade and a half, many mobile &lt;i&gt;experiences&lt;/i&gt; are still lagging behind—and in many cases, causing lost revenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www1.salecycle.com/2020-ecommerce/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;across all industries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, mobile visits accounted for 53% of website traffic, but only 29% of sales. Conversely, desktop users made up 47% of website traffic, and 71% of sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why the gap? &lt;b&gt;Poor mobile experiences.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This disconnect in mobile experience means there’s an opportunity for organizations to pull ahead of the pack by proactively investing in improving their mobile experiences through digital experience intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mobile experiences can be tricky to analyze and optimize, though, which is why it’s critical to choose the right &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;digital experience intelligence (DXI) platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What makes mobile experiences so difficult to optimize? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Analyzing and optimizing any digital experience is a complex process, but mobile experiences can be exceptionally opaque. Why? Mobile experiences don’t have the same uniformity that desktop experiences do because there’s no single common mobile technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mobile experiences can involve unique codebases, myriad operating systems, independent development teams handling iOS and Android apps, and many other factors that make monitoring them complicated. Simple recording technologies, which capture a video or images from a mobile session, simply aren’t flexible enough to provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-intelligence-features-for-complete-dx-data&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;meaningful DX data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When done correctly, digital experience intelligence can help navigate these obstacles to provide trustworthy mobile experience insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But how do you know when DXI is “done correctly?” Here are three tells.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A dynamic combination of quantitative and qualitative data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Improving your mobile experience (and therefore creating competitive advantage) requires a deep understanding of both &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; is happening in your mobile experience and &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; it’s happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital experience intelligence takes the quantitative data developers want (where users click, what they type, where they scroll, and how they navigate their app) and blends it with qualitative features (like session replay and frustration heuristics) that reveal user emotion and intent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;this combination of data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can provide a deep, honest view into the mobile experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A privacy-first approach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The data we just described is invaluable for perfecting mobile experiences—but only if it’s collected and analyzed with the highest level of regard for user privacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tools that simply record everything a mobile user sees on their screen are not only flawed by the lack of flexibility mentioned above, but because they also elevate the risk of collecting sensitive user data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Leading DXI platforms circumvent this risk by using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/mobile-app-analytics-privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;privacy-first recording model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which elements of the app that are marked for exclusion are &lt;i&gt;entirely excluded &lt;/i&gt;from recording, rather than being redacted after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A balance between performance and bandwidth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From a performance standpoint, many screen recording tools fall on two opposite ends of the spectrum: they record in native screen resolutions (resulting in gigantic file sizes), or they downscale the recording (resulting in choppy, low-res playback).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt; With the right DXI solution, mobile teams no longer have to determine which is the lesser of two evils. Leading digital experience platforms have the capability to balance optimized file sizes with high fidelity replay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And because DXI captures this data at an app’s structural level (rather than by recording the screen), high-fidelity replay doesn’t come at the cost of sucking up bandwidth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;More and more, mobile devices are the next frontier for winning and retaining customers by providing an exceptional digital experience. As the leader in digital experience intelligence, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;FullStory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; takes a highly advanced approach to capturing and analyzing your mobile DX data, proactively surfacing areas for improvement while maintaining user privacy and optimizing for performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For more details on the technology behind DXI for mobile and how it can revolutionize your app experience, download our guide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why teams need both DXI and Google Analytics]]></title><description><![CDATA[Why would a team would need DXI when they already have a fully-baked Google Analytics implementation?

And it’s one of the most popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/integrations&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;integrations of the FullStory platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In a word, it’s great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While Google is notoriously hushed about usage statistics of many of their products, one 2015 estimate suggests that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://martech.org/as-google-analytics-turns-10-we-ask-how-many-websites-use-it/#:~:text=According%20to%20W3Techs%2C%20Google%20Analytics,popular%20analytics%20option%2C%20Yandex%20Metrics.&amp;amp;text=The%20Datanyze%20service%20reports%20that,tracks%20are%20using%20Google%20Analytics.&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;jaw-dropping 52% of the entire internet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; uses Google Analytics in some fashion. And that was years ago—a number that’s surely accelerated since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;But Google Analytics has some considerable limitations. Teams can only see data around &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;what&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; is happening, not the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;why.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we’re often asked why a team would need a Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) solution when they already have a fully-baked Google Analytics implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To answer that, it’s important to understand the role both Google Analytics and DXI play in the stack of modern teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why does Google Analytics come up short by itself? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google Analytics offers insight into quantitative aspects of a site, aggregate trends in the user journey, and a general understanding of a website or app’s overall performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With that tool, users can unearth some pretty useful findings, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users visit individual product pages, but then bounce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bounce rate on the pricing page rose 20% last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New feature adoption is lower than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;But Google Analytics stops short in helping to answer &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;why&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; any of those challenges are happening.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Teams can draw inferences on why site visitors are leaving without clicking “buy,” bouncing from the homepage, or aren’t using a new site feature, but those problems can’t be eliminated without tedious, time-consuming trial and error—or a resident clairvoyant on your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do DXI tools support Google Analytics?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;DXI and Google Analytics complement and validate each other in pinpointing problem areas on websites and mobile properties. &lt;/b&gt;From there, DXI tools such as FullStory log, categorize, and triage the actions taken by users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This provides clarity into &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; events are occurring through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/review-user-sessions&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reviewing user sessions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/analyze-digital-experience-data&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;analyzing digital experience data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Back to the previous examples, DXI provides context and rationale that would otherwise be missed, making remediation steps more obvious:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What teams benefit from combining Google Analytics and DXI?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Google Analytics allows product, engineering, UX, and other teams to extract quantitative insight. But layering in a Digital Experience Intelligence solution such as FullStory creates additional depth for numerous teams: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product management teams&lt;/b&gt; can gain global insight into product performance, high-level macro and micro conversion analytics, and a cross-functional, interdisciplinary source of truth for all functions PMs engage with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engineering teams&lt;/b&gt; can recreate and triage bugs right as users experience them, plus see root-cause and conversion impact and correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UX teams &lt;/b&gt;can field test against a global population instead of a sample set of users, and rapidly test hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analytics teams&lt;/b&gt; can combine FullStory data to existing data sets with Data Export API to for total understanding of digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Support teams&lt;/b&gt; can experience what a troubled user is experiencing—in parallel, like they are sitting side-by-side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Design&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;teams&lt;/b&gt; can monitor and quantify frictional design components and track progress of new design constructs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
What’s more, each team benefits from proactive management of digital products, native mobile apps, and websites. &lt;b&gt;While Google Analytics can tell you what’s already happened, DXI platforms such as FullStory can use user data in aggregate to find problem spots before users experience them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The final verdict&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;DXI tools such as FullStory and Google Analytics aren’t in direct opposition to each other. They’re both important parts of the modern marketing, UX, and product management stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;But teams that rely exclusively on Google Analytics for gathering and parsing user data are missing critical information needed to optimize and improve work.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thousands of leading product, UX, and engineering teams are converging FullStory with Google Analytics to accelerate product development and eradicate bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ready, set, go: How to holiday-proof your digital experience strategy]]></title><description><![CDATA[Use this guide to ensure your ecommerce strategy is ready for an unprecedented holiday shopping season.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/ecommerce-holiday-shopping-guide/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/ecommerce-holiday-shopping-guide/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The ecommerce pro&amp;#x27;s guide to the holiday shopping season&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As an ecommerce professional, you know that prepping for the holidays is a complex process that requires collaboration between marketing, product, engineering, and customer support teams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Revenues from online retail&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are projected to grow to $5.4 trillion dollars in 2022—and more in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s more important than ever to plan ahead and make every customer touchpoint count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This ecommerce holiday preparedness article is designed to help you assess your strategy’s strengths and weaknesses, and to offer resources for filling in the gaps.

The smallest inconvenience could cause them to leave for a competitor. Here are some areas to focus on when optimizing your checkout flow: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Minimizing friction in your checkout flow:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Identifying and eliminating friction in your checkout flow can help lower the chances that a would-be customer will leave as the result of some minor error or inconvenience. Analyze and address checkout flow friction by:

The good news is that there are steps you can take to reduce cart abandonment rates. Here are some things you can do to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/strategies-to-improve-checkout-flow-and-reduce-cart-abandonment/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;combat cart abandonment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on your site or app:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barilliance.com/10-reasons-shopping-cart-abandonment/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;top reason&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; users report abandoning carts is unexpected shipping costs. Be transparent when it comes to shipping, or consider offering free or reduced shipping during the holiday rush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep the “back” button fully functional to allow transition between browsing and checkout/cart. If a user feels trapped within a checkout process and can’t easily navigate away from it, they’re more likely to simply close the tab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test adding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://spyrestudios.com/13-progress-bar-ui-design-examples/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;progress indicator bar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to your checkout process so that users can understand how close they are to completing their purchase. Progress bars appeal to the idea of “endowed progress”—we are more likely to complete a task if we are provided with artificial progress towards this task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it easy to “save” a shopping cart for a guest to return to later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When possible, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shopify.com/blog/abandoned-cart-emails&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;follow up with cart abandoners&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the form of emails and dynamic ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Set your sights on site performance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Online shopping is a competitive landscape, and a slow-loading website is a quick way to lose would-be customers. While measuring site performance is important all year, it’s especially critical during the holiday season when websites and apps experience higher-than-normal traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Performance has proven to have a huge effect on eCommerce KPIs: for example, when Tempur-Pedic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/2-tips-for-faster-websites-and-online-stores/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduced their site load times by 20%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they saw their average order value increase by 14%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What should you do to improve site performance?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speed test: &lt;/b&gt;Run a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;quick speed test&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for an analysis of your site speed on desktop and mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Load testing:&lt;/b&gt; Before heading into the holidays, it’s also a good idea to run load testing on your website with a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microfocus.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;LoadRunner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Micro Focus or &lt;a href=&quot;https://loader.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Loader&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These tools simulate the traffic of thousands of website visitors at once and help to identify areas where performance suffers, to address the issues before the real traffic pours in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Site monitoring:&lt;/b&gt; Consider setting up a site monitoring tool that will send an alert (generally via email, text, or custom integration) if your site goes down—especially with an influx of holiday shoppers. Check out free or subscription-based tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://uptimerobot.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Uptime Robot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statuscake.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;StatusCake&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that will monitor your site at 5-minute intervals from several locations to make sure it’s behaving properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Site performance: &lt;/b&gt;Also, consider installing a solution, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://calibreapp.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Calibre&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://rigor.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rigor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to monitor your site’s overall performance. They can help audit and optimize how your site performs over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Be proactive with digital holiday promotions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s never too early to start strategizing your holiday promotions (and the sooner, the better). Here are a few tips and resources for running smart campaigns:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use UTM parameters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;UTMs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are a tagging system that measures where web traffic is coming from, shedding light on the effectiveness of marketing efforts. Use these in emails and social campaigns leading up to and throughout holiday promotions in order to know what traffic is a direct result of those efforts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Run A/B tests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Testing is a great way to learn what resonates with your audience and iterate on those insights in future marketing efforts. When it comes to your holiday promotions, any number of tests can be conducted, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visual tests&lt;/b&gt; such as CTA button color, product image sizes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Content tests&lt;/b&gt; such as copy variations, personalization, email author, subject, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Timing tests&lt;/b&gt; such as time of day and frequency of social posts and email sends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Take into account the risks and rewards of running &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.widerfunnel.com/blog/ab-testing-during-the-holidays/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;A/B tests during the holiday season&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as learnings may not be applicable to future tests during the off-season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customize email marketing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Incorporating email into your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.constantcontact.com/write-holiday-marketing-email/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;holiday campaign strategy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a no-brainer: it’s a free way to reach your most engaged customers. Employ some simple strategies to make sure your email marketing counts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customization&lt;/b&gt;: Use the data you have to personalize your marketing emails as much as possible by incorporating your customers’ names, recommendations based on past purchases, and relevant special offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re-engagement&lt;/b&gt;: Engage dormant email leads with nurture tracks that aim to wake them up. This might include “we miss you” messaging or limited-time offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re-up retargeting ads&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Retargeting ads are a way to reach people who have already visited your site, and the audience’s familiarity with your brand makes these ads highly effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s no surprise that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/pricing&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Facebook ad prices&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; skyrocket during the holiday season: customers’ newsfeeds are especially valuable real estate starting as early as September, with cost per click rising nearly $0.15 above the average by December. Make sure you’re maximizing your Facebook ad budget with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/10/15/holiday-marketing-tips&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;holiday strategies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like additional placements, custom audiences and special offers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get ahead of code freeze &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Code freeze is a website development tactic that prevents site architecture from being edited or modified during a certain period and is common during the holiday season. Many ecommerce, product, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/engineers-guide-dxi/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;software engineers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; implement a code freeze to prevent checkout bugs or other poor experiences when anticipating high-traffic periods like the holiday rush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the need for &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegood.com/insights/holiday-code-freeze/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;code freezes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can be controversial today, the one thing that’s certain is that you shouldn’t let it stop you from improving your site experience. Get ahead of code freeze with real-time insights. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/analyze-digital-experience-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;analyze digital experience data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to increase conversions and grow revenue with FullStory’s DXI solution and native apps before the holiday code freeze. Having digital intelligence insights can help you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor your checkout flow ahead of the holiday season&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify indicators of UX and UI issues to fix quickly and avoid revenue losses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better understand points of friction using heatmaps and signals
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Expect the unexpected this holiday shopping season&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No matter how excellent your digital holiday strategy is, unexpected issues are still likely to crop up. While you can’t predict exactly what those problems will be, you can outline a response plan for any situation. Here are ways to help with communication, bug fixes, and customer enablement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Communication plan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Internal&lt;/b&gt;: Employees tend to be scattered during the holidays, and it can be difficult to keep track of who is on or offline on any given day. How will you efficiently notify the appropriate person or team if something on your site or app breaks at a critical moment? Your internal communication plan can be as simple as a spreadsheet of on-call employee(s) on days when your office is closed, along with info on what channels they’ll need to monitor during their shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;External&lt;/b&gt;: The second part of your plan should detail how to communicate with customers in the event of an issue. This might include a pop-up on your site, an email to the affected customers (if possible), and social media updates. Identify who would be responsible for each element of the plan and ensure they know what to do in a time-sensitive situation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bug identification plan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Bugs are inevitable. It’s how you handle, track and address them that determines how much or little they impact customers. For most teams, the key is to unify these processes into a single tracking tool where bugs can be monitored and managed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you’ve established what that software will be and have achieved product adoption from the team, you will be able to: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/convince-product-managers-a-bug-needs-fixing/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;identify and define bugs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, organize and secure them, and set up processes for tracking bugs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer enablement plan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The holiday season is already a sprint for your customer support team; lighten their load by giving customers the resources to answer their own questions whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask tenured support team members about the most common customer questions from past seasons and incorporate these into an easy-to-find FAQ on your website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider adding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-ai-chatbot&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;chatbot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to your site that can answer basic questions automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t force customers to hunt for shipping and return info; make it prominent on your website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that your entire team has the tools, processes, and protocols they need to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, remember that the holidays are a busy, stress-filled season. Take steps to foster an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/3-ways-product-teams-can-cultivate-user-empathy/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;empathetic culture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and prevent burnout among your support team members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Your mobile shopping experience matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re not already convinced of the importance of the mobile shopping experience, this stat should help you get there:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This year alone, &lt;a href=&quot;https://buildfire.com/mobile-commerce-trends/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;79% of mobile users made an online purchase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; using their mobile devices—and this is before the holiday season has begun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your online store isn’t optimized for mobile, you’re very likely to be leaving money on the table this holiday season. Here are two key considerations:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Page load speed&lt;/b&gt;: 1 in 4 visitors will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/building-websites/website-load-time-statistics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;abandon a website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that takes longer than 4 seconds to load. There’s no singular quick fix for speeding up your mobile site, but there are a few steps you can take to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/improve-ecommerce-experience-DXI/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;improve your mobile experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Browsers and screen sizes&lt;/b&gt;: To ensure that your site renders correctly across all browsers and devices, you’re going to have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/5-customer-experience-optimizations-black-friday-cyber-monday-sales/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;check in on your customer experience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Use your phone to go through the checkout flow on the top browsers. Do this from all smartphones, and tablets. Note and address any issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

The next day, a few similar (though slightly less polite) complaints roll in. And the following days, there are so many complaints that churn becomes a risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yep, you’ve got a bug that needs to be fixed &lt;i&gt;yesterday—&lt;/i&gt;but you need to get buy-in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As an engineer, getting the bug fixed means first convincing your product manager (PM) that it should be a priority. Here’s how to build a case that’s backed by data and customer empathy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Make a case with both quantitative &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; qualitative data &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A compelling case should speak to your PM’s head &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a Digital Experience Intelligence platform like FullStory on your side, you can leverage user insights to uncover the data that will make your case strongest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Quantifying the problem: A look at the numbers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A good place to start is to find out how many people are experiencing the problem. Use your DXI platform to pull the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;segment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of those affected to help you visualize relevant trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next, quantify the impact the bug is having on the appropriate metric—this could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/use-dev-tools-to-see-the-impact-of-performance-on-conversions/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conversions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, engagement, or something else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Don’t be afraid to use informed estimates if for some reason you don’t know the exact figures. The purpose of assigning numerical values to the bug is to generate discussion and help the PM triage importance relative to other priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Qualitative measures: Queue empathy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s no better way to help your PM understand customers’ experiences than by actually showing them what’s happening. Here, a DXI solution’s ability to create user &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;empathy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; really comes in handy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/what-is-session-replay-useful-for/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, return to the issue and watch exactly what the customer’s experience was. Showing your PM a customer’s struggle and frustration is a powerful way to spur an empathetic response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session replay also helps PMs track exactly what chain of events led to the bug. With this feature, it’s easy to see how users are running into problems and mark exactly where in a session they encountered the bug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, DXI allows you to play back JavaScript to see the error that’s being triggered. Reproducing bugs becomes as easy as a few clicks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, you can leave &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828513-How-do-I-share-notes-or-session-links-with-my-team-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;notes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in sessions to provide context and stats (such as volume of requests and time users have spent stuck on a bug) right alongside the session playback to further inform your PM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By creating this powerful combination of data and empathy, your PM can easily assess how a bug should be treated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Combat recency bias with empathetic distance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sometimes a bug crops up, there may not be time to fix it right away. This is a good time to consider empathetic distance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is “empathetic distance” in this scenario? It’s putting time between when the bug is first documented and when it’s reported to the product team. This could be five to ten minutes or an entire day, depending on the size of the issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Taking a pause between receiving the customer case and raising it to the product team helps balance out the innate tendency toward &lt;a href=&quot;https://recknsense.com/what-is-recency-bias-why-we-over-index-on-new-information/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;recency bias&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Empathetic distance helps teams prioritize the changes that will have the most impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this scenario, use your DXI solution to &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020622214-Attaching-FullStory-sessions-to-bug-reports&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;attach a session link to your bug report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring the person fixing it has easy access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Communicating with customers honestly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No matter how convincing your case may be, not all bugs that are brought to your product manager’s attention are going to get fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When a bug gets passed over, close the loop with your customers. They will thank you for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com/blog/customer-engagement/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;honest communication&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure that any product updates you send are contextual and valuable to the customer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Be straightforward in your communication. Update them on the problem and demonstrate that you care about their experience by offering continued support. While it may not be what they want to hear, they’ll appreciate your follow-through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using Digital Experience Intelligence to fix those bugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bugs are unavoidable, but with DXI platform like FullStory, reporting, understanding, and resolving them becomes a lot less painful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For more info about how we address issues like this at FullStory, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/tag/engineering/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engineering Blog&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Digital Experience Intelligence supercharges your tech stack]]></title><description><![CDATA[Look for DXI solutions that offer a robust library of out-of-the-box integrations and open APIs to help build a best-in-class tech stack.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/integrate-digital-experience-intelligence-for-a-stronger-tech-stack</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/integrate-digital-experience-intelligence-for-a-stronger-tech-stack</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve all been there. You notice something &lt;i&gt;interesting&lt;/i&gt; in the data surfaced in an analytics tool your product team uses. You want to investigate further, share it with other teams, and ideally, identify the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, your efforts are riddled with challenges—other teams can’t access the tools you’re using, the data doesn’t match other systems, or the data you’re trying to compare isn’t apples-to-apples with other analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unsurprisingly, siloed data is a particularly acute pain for siloed teams. Having data that isn’t accessible across teams or systems causes confusion and frustration, leaving users with more questions than reliable answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To avoid the pitfalls of siloed data, choose and rely on platforms that integrate with one another. That way, your teams have a single source of truth to follow, and collaboration is encouraged, not stifled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-intelligence-features-for-complete-dx-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;complete DX data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dxi-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;pixel-perfect session recreation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ability to seamlessly integrate with popular tools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, leading Digital Experience Intelligence platforms serve as that single source of truth for organizations. Look for DXI solutions that offer a robust library of out-of-the-box integrations and open APIs to help build a best-in-class tech stack—making  your apps smarter, your critical workflows snappier, and your teams more flexible and productive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4 ways DXI adds agility to your technology toolkit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simplify sharing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Look for a DXI solution that streamlines your communications, not complicates them.

Adding or replacing software in your tech stack can slow productivity and bottleneck adoption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Avoid these hurdles by choosing a DXI solution that supplements your tech stack with an expanding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/partners/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;network of out-of-the-box integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or even allows you to customize integrations via Webhooks or JavaScript and HTTP APIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, a DXI platform that connects with popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/using-ipaas-connectors-for-scalable-integrations&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;iPaaS solutions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (such as Tray.io, Workato, and Zapier) will allow you to streamline automation, successfully scale your tech stack, and maintain smoother processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Export digital experience data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you’ve successfully broken down your DX data silos, you can harness the power of Digital Experience Intelligence to amplify your business intelligence data. Export and layer DXI interaction datasets to your existing data to elevate your analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your business intelligence practices will become even more meaningful with the addition of trusted, complete digital experience data from DXI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tap into your data layer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adding DXI to your tech stack doesn’t mean you’ll need to completely overhaul current processes, reporting capabilities, or custom events your team has invested time in tracking. Instead, look for a DXI solution with the ability to ingest common data layer attributes across analytics platforms, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/prepare/data-layer.html?lang=en#setting-data-layer-values&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adobe Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6164391?hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Tag Manager&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That way, you can automatically access the data collected in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-data-layer-and-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;data layer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in your DXI platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a tech stack turbocharged by DXI, your team can rely on next-level tools to work smarter, not harder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[3 ways product teams can cultivate user empathy]]></title><description><![CDATA[Empathy puts the heart back in analytics.

But today, it’s a core part of any business function or team. If your goal is to build an amazing online experience for your customers, then empathy must become everyone&amp;#x27;s job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kateleto.com/articles/empathy-is-an-important-part-of-your-job-as-a-product-leader&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Empathy for product leaders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by definition, is the act of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, and thoughts of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That action needs to be present in the development and design of your company’s products or services. Before we dig into some tips, here are some ways to find empathy in between the lines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What can empathy reveal for product teams?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Empathy allows teams to do the following:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take on a user’s perspective.&lt;/b&gt; Put yourself in your customers&amp;#x27; shoes when they experience a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reserve judgment.&lt;/b&gt; Realize that time is better spent developing solutions to problems rather than casting blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider emotion.&lt;/b&gt; Prioritize problems that cause users serious frustration over smaller bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
While traditional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;quantitative&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; analytics can tell you some of what you need to know about your site or app, they&amp;#x27;ll never be able to tell you the full story. &lt;b&gt;Understanding and sharing the feelings of your users is key to finding qualitative insights and customer-oriented solutions to UX problems big and small.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How teams can read between the line graphs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next time you&amp;#x27;re sorting through quantitative product data, try viewing it through an empathetic lens. Take that line graph and imagine the tactile, tangible customer experiences those numbers represent. For instance, imagine that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;50,000 people visit your site&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;0.8% of your visitors experience an error&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;400 out of 50,000 people experienced the error  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In volume, 400 doesn’t feel like that much considering…but what happens when we think of the 400 users &lt;i&gt;empathetically&lt;/i&gt;? Imagine sitting in an auditorium with 399 other people, all experiencing the same problem. You may have a different viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Empathy puts the heart back in quantitative analytics. &lt;/b&gt;It&amp;#x27;s grounded by a real user&amp;#x27;s lived experience. Engineers and web developers who think empathetically have a more holistic idea of how to troubleshoot bugs and make product improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3 methods to help cultivate empathy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. See through the customer’s eyes (literally) &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One of the best and simplest ways to empathize with someone is to talk to them about their experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Participating in customer support calls is a great way for engineers to hear problems as they arise and pick up on a little old-fashioned nuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Gather context on how customers interact with your site and products. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tools such as FullStory feature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you know exactly what the customer&amp;#x27;s problem was. Every time a customer submits a ticket, support can find the session where the customer was using the product and replay the instance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The result is that, by being able to see what the customer was doing before submitting the ticket, customer support is able to address problems immediately, instead of either guessing at the error or asking the customer more questions. This frees up the time and resources to give every customer a personal solution to their precise issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Collaborate in themes, not teams&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Collaboration can get messy. Ideas flow better when employees get to work with those of different skill sets. Experiment with re-structuring the workflow to run on themes, not teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Themes are a collaborative method to remove the typical hierarchy of the team placing interested parties from traditionally separate backgrounds on equal footing. Engineering, design, sales, and support personnel all get in the same room and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jotform.com/blog/collaboration-activities/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;collaborate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a particular theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Organizing around themes fosters a balanced, empathetic approach to the effort in which each job function has an opportunity to represent a viewpoint that aligns with their objectives. The effect is greater empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Watch actions, not words &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Find empathy in actions when words aren’t available. See how visitors interact with you digitally, without even speaking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From the big picture to the smallest details, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/analyze-digital-experience-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DXI solutions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; such as FullStory provide visualizations into what gets your customer’s attention, where they go, what they click, and more through:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heat Maps :&lt;/b&gt; Quickly reveal which areas of your pages are hot, cold, or lukewarm, and assess how to increase engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Click Maps :&lt;/b&gt; See precisely how many visitors click any element on any page without worrying whether dynamic content or variable page states are distorting your numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scroll Maps :&lt;/b&gt; Calculate the percentage of sessions where users reached a specific scroll depth to understand whether key features get lost at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The in-crowd already knows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/what-is-session-replay-useful-for/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful way to step into your customer&amp;#x27;s shoes and gain insights on individual user behavior. Empathy is a natural outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Replay exactly why an error happened or where a user got confused. FullStory users have found session replay to be an indispensable time-saver for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/engineers-quantify-value-dxi/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;engineers looking to quantify their work&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Make empathy a common practice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Practicing empathy helps to understand customers&amp;#x27; pain points, and it reveals powerful ways to build better products and improve design. Product developers—engineers and programmers—and designers stand to benefit by putting empathy to work on their projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A quick recap to use more empathy in your workflow is to see what your customers are experiencing, collaborate with your team using themes, and be sure to watch actions as they arise in the product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a DXI solution in your pocket, you can easily add empathy to your daily routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[4 ways DXI helps globally dispersed teams]]></title><description><![CDATA[No matter where your users are—or where your team is—Digital Experience Intelligence tools can pinpoint user friction.

Job searches for remote work are up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/covid-pandemic-pushes-hunt-for-remote-jobs-up-460percent.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;460%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Couple those two trends with &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-h1-2021-monthly-recap/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;sky-high venture funding levels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/leadership/the-next-normal-arrives-trends-that-will-define-2021-and-beyond&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;global expansion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the writing’s on the wall: tomorrow’s product, UX, and engineering teams might never be under the same roof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Still, each team needs to collaborate to address user concerns and stymie any friction in the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) platforms like FullStory are adept at helping fast-scaling, global teams thrive, no matter where they might be—especially in these four ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dashboards offer at-a-glance stats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Essentially, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/5-product-management-dashboards/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dashboards&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; take a broad array of data and present it in a way that addresses the questions you and your team have. Whatever the platform—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/DXI-fullstory-google-analytics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Adobe Analytics or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;a Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—Dashboards make it easy to answer questions about specific KPIs and monitor them for trends or anomalies over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When Dashboards are accessible across teams, there’s a single source of truth to follow—a set of KPIs readily available as a North Star. Specifically, best-in-class DXI tools like FullStory offer Dashboards detailing single metrics (such as average cart value), funnels (such as checkout flows), trends (“Are purchases going up or down?”), among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No matter where teams may be, easily digestible Dashboards can point teams of all stripes—technical and non-technical alike—toward a common goal, right at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Session Replay shows exactly what’s happening&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As described in FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Definitive Guide to Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all web analytics tools exist to solve a fundamental problem: provide actionable, reliable, and timely insights about users. Understanding the real-life person engaging online, on the other end of the screen, means asking a lot of questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did the user encounter a problem?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did the user expect to happen that didn’t happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was the user’s experience really like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, with DXI, it’s easier than ever to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform/analyze-digital-experience-data/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;analyze DX data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/what-is-session-replay-useful-for/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Terms such as “session record” or “screen recording” get tossed around as synonyms. In reality, especially in the context of privacy, they’re miles apart. Recording everything a user sees on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/dxi-for-mobile-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;mobile device&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or a website falls short on several fronts around privacy—something leading DXI solutions such as FullStory never risk. Session Replay transforms logged user events, such as mouse movements, clicks, page visits, scrolling, tapping, etc., into a reproduction of what the user actually did on the site or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Specifically for globally dispersed teams, DXI solutions offer the ability to watch, internally comment on, and share logged—not recorded—user sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session Replay helps teams collaborate securely across teams and narrow in on exactly what users are experiencing—no matter where your team is, and no matter where users are.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integrations provide tech stack depth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Teams of all stripes—engineering, product, UX, and others—cling to a specific, battle-tested stack of preferred tools to get their work done. Adding others into the mix, or replacing one tool for another, causes another hurdle, especially when &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com/blog/onboarding-remote-employees/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asynchronous onboarding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is quickly becoming the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;DXI solutions like FullStory help supplement the stack of tools you already use with a host of impressive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/qualtrics-and-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qualtrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for NPS surveys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/DXI-fullstory-google-analytics/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for marketing detail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/capture-bugs-like-fireflies-in-a-jar-with-fullstory-for-jira/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jira&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for bug tracking and dev sprints&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/new-relic-distributed-tracing-and-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;New Relic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for technical and behavioral data &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conversion Reports snapshot user interactions &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No matter your industry, function, or vertical, users will experience &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; friction to completing the goal you’ve set out for them (onboarding, purchasing, etc.). Having dispersed teams collaborating asynchronously across time zones and continents doesn’t make remediating these issues easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;DXI solutions like FullStory offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/conversions-by-fullstory/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conversion Reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which provide product, engineering, and UX teams with a prioritized list of the most impactful issues reducing your conversion rates through any workflow. Better yet, to accommodate users familiar with complex technology and leaders needing an instant pulse check, these solutions can be both verbose and detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detailed reports&lt;/b&gt; show all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034527793-Conversions-Introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;technical details of conversions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including affected users and conversion impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Verbose reports&lt;/b&gt; serve up the same intel in a more expansive way, often better suited for stakeholders, and ties each issue to individual sessions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No matter where your team is now, or where they’ll be in the future, DXI can help teams acclimate to fast-paced, collaborative work—even if they’re never in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[5 user experience optimizations for the best holiday season ever]]></title><description><![CDATA[What can you do to ready your site or mobile app for the coming shopping frenzy?

The numbers are in your favor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Retail ecommerce sales&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worldwide amounted to $4.28 trillion and online retail revenues are projected to grow to $5.4 trillion in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over one-third of retail sales now come &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/dxi-for-mobile-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;via mobile device&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; driving over $47 billion worth of revenue in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/288487/forecast-of-global-b2c-e-commerce-growth/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Global retail ecommerce sales&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; grew 27.6% compared to the previous year and ecommerce sales accounted for 18% of global retail sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Research from Forrester suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.profitero.com/blog/digitally-influenced-sales-phrase-that-unlocks-buyin-budget-for-ecommerce-leader&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;62% of all sales are now digitally influenced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (for both online and offline sales). That means your digital shopping experience—how customers experience your e-commerce site or app—is now the linchpin to your success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what can you do to ready your site—or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/dxi-for-mobile-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;mobile app&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—for the coming shopping frenzy? Let&amp;#x27;s take a look! Here are five ways to optimize your user experience this season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Find and fix friction in the checkout flow&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As of 2021, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020622574-Can-FullStory-show-me-users-who-abandoned-a-form-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;cart abandonment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rate was 80.6% for mobile phones. Even well-optimized ecommerce sites are sure to have opportunities to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Start by analyzing the checkout flow with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as FullStory. As FullStory stores and organizes user engagement down to on-page interactions—and performance—it&amp;#x27;s easy to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-fullstory-on-funnels/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;create a conversion funnel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that strings together the digital behaviors that matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Integrate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; those digital experience events from a DXI solution with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/customize-fullstory-with-defined-events/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;custom events&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (such as those from &lt;a href=&quot;https://tealium.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tealium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://segment.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Segment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and it will rope in otherwise unseeable data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The result is a clear visualization of your funnel—and a few hints at where folks are dropping off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence tools also allow teams to analyze funnels. For example, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034527793-Conversions-Introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conversions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will reveal if a customer struggle—revealed through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or other on-page signals—is holding shoppers back as well as how it&amp;#x27;s impacting metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you prioritize what’s most important, take a closer look with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to confirm the problem. And with all that digital experience context, ideas for immediate fixes, optimization, or future A/B tests will arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Optimize performance for high-volume traffic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Performance has a huge effect on e-commerce KPIs: for example, Carvana’s product team wanted to make the site’s search bar more functional and user-friendly. To do this, the team worked through half a dozen iterations and watched user sessions in FullStory to analyze engagement and evaluate each version. Ultimately, the changes the team made resulted in an uptick in product usage, all &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customer-story/ecommerce-retail/carvana/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;without sacrificing site speed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So how do you keep your finger on the pulse of performance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re a medium-to-large retailer and plan to offer seasonal doorbuster specials, try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atatus.com/blog/what-is-load-testing/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;load testing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a few recommended tools: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blazemeter.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Blazemeter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the continuous testing platform, along with this extensive list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://testguild.com/load-testing-tools/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;load testing solutions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ongoing performance monitoring, consider tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://calibreapp.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Calibre&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://rigor.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rigor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They measure page load speed for an entire shopping cart flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828313-Guide-to-Dev-Tools&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dev Tools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helps teams glean insights into page performance from real users—not synthetic traffic as with other performance monitoring services. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623654-How-do-I-use-the-Network-view-in-Dev-Tools-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Network&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; analysis view that reveals requests made by the browser and how long each request took.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Have a mobile-first mentality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Typically, mobile volumes typically pick up as the season approaches. Just don’t expect mobile shoppers to be in a relaxed state of mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a study examining data from across the web, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hobo-web.co.uk/your-website-design-should-load-in-4-seconds/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;53% of mobile visitors abandon a page if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. How thin is a mobile shopper&amp;#x27;s patience going to be when they’re hunting for the best deals at the last minute?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Here&amp;#x27;s what to do: Build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/funnel-analysis-for-digital-experience/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conversion funnel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for mobile shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using a DXI solution like FullStory, build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828993-Segment&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;segment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of users who experienced your site or app on a mobile device. From there, construct a conversion funnel to reflect seasonal deals. This could be the checkout flow to examine mobile conversions. Or build out a funnel to the highly marketed deals, store hours or contact us page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To make the most of replay analysis, follow these steps: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save a funnel as a segment to easily use it for future analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify which steps in your funnel you want to troubleshoot, and exclude the event filter at the point of failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch these sessions and take notes on any behavioral trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Account for various browsers and screens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s important to understand where customers are--all types of devices, computers, browsers, and operating systems.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review the checkout funnel using various web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set the screen resolution as low as it will go and do it again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switch to a different operating system and repeat those steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now repeat with other devices like a tablet or smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The goal is to make sure your site and e-commerce shop look good and function with every combination of browser and device customers could possibly be using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Leading DXI solutions offer a shortcut for this! While this could all be done manually, you could also pop open a DXI solution like FullStory and look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020827373-Can-FullStory-tell-me-what-the-top-screen-resolutions-are-for-my-segment-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;screen resolution breakdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, select replays from customers on a particular browser and device and watch those sessions to take note of any glaring errors or rendering problems—like the team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customer-story/ecommerce-retail/moosejaw/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Moosejaw&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Help customer service breeze through the support queue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One (huge) benefit to installing a digital experience platform that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the ability to replay sessions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is that it helps aid in providing excellent customer service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why? Without session replay, your team may need to ask clarifying questions or request screenshots to resolve tickets. The more emails that go back and forth with a customer simply to understand concerns, the more frustrated the customer gets—and the longer the queue becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the ability to replay the customer’s session, the customer’s frustrations are revealed, how they tried to resolve them, and how to help them achieve their goal. All but the most complex tickets can be closed in a single touch, freeing up your team to tackle the next problem (and maybe even giving them some breathing room to take a walk or grab some coffee).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Have the best season yet with digital insights leading the way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This season, you will be armed and ready with digital insights. Find and fix friction in the checkout flow, keep an eye on the performance with key metrics, build conversion funnels for mobile users, test across various browsers and screens, and use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DXI solution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to create replays to aid customer support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Enjoy watching those orders roll in, and may this be your best season yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you’re just beginning to think about e-commerce experience strategy, or you’re ready for a more robust DXI solution, FullStory’s data and analytics have the answers you need.

Which is nice advice, but for dev teams and engineers, it can be a bit more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;When people involved with your work (executives and top management) can’t quite understand the intricacies of what you do, it gets hard to quantify and explain the benefit of your work.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your engineering team needs to prove the tangible, financial value of its work, we have three benchmarks for you to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;(Want to skip ahead to the details? Check out “&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/engineers-guide-dxi/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The software engineer’s guide to Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.”)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The amount and quality of code being shipped&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One common metric by which software development teams are measured is how good and how much code is shipped—how often the work of developers sees the light of day in the products and services the company offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After all, when teams &lt;i&gt;aren’t&lt;/i&gt; shipping, hard work is effectively wasted. Code that sits on the shelf for weeks or months often gathers subtle bugs, and it’s difficult for teams to jump right back into the same frame of mind they had later down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
At the same time, shipping not only helps products—it also helps developers themselves. When software goes out to users, feedback slowly makes its way to the development teams from product managers, helping devs hone their skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;However, using &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) tools&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; such as FullStory, engineering teams can see first-hand, near-immediate end-user interaction with any new code pushes via &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;While bugs are inherent, Session Replay helps dev teams narrow down on exactly what users see, and how &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828313-Guide-to-Dev-Tools&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;page performance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; affects your customer experience.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solving important user problems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, code is being shipped, and the product is being improved. Great news!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, is your website or app being improved for the sake of improvement, or is your work substantially minimizing the user problems teams really have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While development roadmaps and prioritization is a hand-in-hand exercise with product management teams, it’s critical for engineers themselves to ask questions and look for a deeper “why” to any prioritization directive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asking questions helps dev teams become more closely aligned with users and product teams alike, and nearly always results in a better end product. &lt;/b&gt;Aligning the specs laid out by product teams, what users need, and what dev teams can accomplish in a set period of time helps create total transparency into the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The end result: resolving user problems that make a difference for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s more, with modern DXI tools, teams can draw a line between problem identification and engineering work, indicating that your team helped solve business-critical problems.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tying site performance and revenue impact&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s say you’re the manager for a web dev team that handles the website and mobile app of a major ecommerce retailer. Sizable amounts of revenue and thousands of visitors depend on the quality of your code. On occasion, small bugs pop up, and you and your team triage and correct them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When your CTO emails you and asks for clarity around the business impact of your work, what do you tell him or her? Sure, you’re helping make the user experience stronger, but what’s the dollar amount associated with that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A huge benefit of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;DXI tools such as FullStory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; is connecting the dots between site performance and revenue impact. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For instance, see the number of lost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/conversions-by-fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conversions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; associated with friction and frustration points, then resolve and watch quantitative impact. No more black-box revenue calculations or panicked looks when asked how your role contributes to overall company health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;For more in-depth details about DXI and engineering teams, check out “&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/engineers-guide-dxi/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;The software engineer’s guide to Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[FullStory now SOC 2 Type II certified]]></title><description><![CDATA[You've seen that strange combination of letters, numbers, and Roman numerals before: "SOC 2 Type II."

This is in addition to our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html&quot;&gt;ISO 27001 certification&lt;/a&gt; obtained in 2020, which is valid through 2022 and includes annual surveillance audits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And now, in 2021, we’ve obtained our first SOC 3 report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Introducing FullStory’s SOC 3 report&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A SOC 3 report is a publicly available version of a SOC 2 Type 2 report. It’s shortened, doesn’t require an NDA, and gives the auditor’s opinion when they have finished testing us on everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In years past, SOC 3 reports did not offer the auditor&amp;#x27;s opinion, but we immediately sought a SOC 3 report now that the auditor’s opinion is now offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s some context about what a SOC 3 report represents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you see that we—or any other company you interact with—has completed a SOC 2 or&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;SOC 3 audit, you can rest assured that we have been thoroughly tested and are suitably designed and operating effectively, and that the data in our report is reliable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we’re proud of our efforts to ensure privacy and security for you and your data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’d like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.whistic.com/v2/request-profile/949f0fdf-293a-42b2-aea8-7ddcf5d3165c/7753bf79-23ff-4087-a6af-2b6186848c15&quot;&gt;view the report here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Our hybrid approach to work ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Insights on the hybrid approach to work that we’ve developed for FullStorians, and our plans for how this will help accelerate us into the future. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/our-hybrid-approach-to-work</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/our-hybrid-approach-to-work</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStorians can work from wherever they are most productive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Like companies around the world, the pandemic has forced FullStory &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-goes-remote/&quot;&gt;to rethink&lt;/a&gt; (and rethink, and rethink again) the role our physical office spaces play for our employees. Here are some insights on the hybrid approach to work that we’ve developed for FullStorians, and our plans for how this will help accelerate us into the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opening our doors while staying remote-first&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our Atlanta office’s primary purpose has shifted from being a place where FullStorians “go to work” daily to being an energizing space that incites &lt;b&gt;collaboration&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;teamwork&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;connection&lt;/b&gt; across the company. Working from the office—which we affectionately call HQ4—is entirely optional, and FullStorians are now more strategic in how they think about where they work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We encourage our colleagues to think of the office as a tool in their tool box. You won’t  need it for everything, but when you do, it&amp;#x27;s available. Under this opt-in model, 44% of FullStorians worked from HQ at some point in the three months between May and July, while 10% of FullStorians worked from HQ weekly. In order to be inclusive of all employees around the world, meetings and connection events remain remote friendly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The flexibility to work from a location that sparks creativity, productivity, and joy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rather than making plans and policies based on how we &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; FullStorians will prefer to work in a post-COVID world, we’ve intentionally stood back and watched how people organically use the office as it becomes an option for work again. We are starting to see three personas emerge: -- the remote worker who prefers to stay at home, the worker who craves consistent time in the office, and the hybrid worker who wants the flexibility to choose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The next step is to “pave the cowpaths,” using these observed work preferences to inform the choices we offer FullStorians in the future and adapting our physical spaces to suit those needs. One thing is for sure: many FullStorians prefer to work from home, and that flexibility is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Facetime isn’t necessary, but we also love running into each other&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to a hybrid work environment, we’re committed to the belief that you don’t need facetime to be successful. But we also know that serendipitously running into people in a shared space helps build relationships and community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do we balance these two schools of thought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStorians are defined by curiosity and empathy, and while these characteristics come alive when we gather, they also form the foundation for our virtual interactions. A remote FullStorian who recently visited HQ4 for the first time said it best: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Being at HQ4 for a week was awesome, but the best part was that the virtual culture FullStory has built 100% carried over to how I felt in-person. FullStorians are just as kind, hard-working, and welcoming IRL [in real life] as they are virtually.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The number one priority is keeping FullStorians safe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The pandemic has proven that FullStorians are productive and passionate from wherever they are, and that we can find creative ways to connect and bond even without being in the same physical location. We will continue iterating and adapting our policies to accommodate varying comfort levels and to ensure that FullStorians stay safe, connected, and productive during this challenging time. That said, we can’t deny that we look forward to the day when we can all gather once again—because after all, FullStorians are our secret sauce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dear COVID, please go away&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next year, we hope to be able to host occasional in-person all-hands gatherings and give teams  the opportunity to gather a couple of additional times throughout the year. These gatherings will be times to connect, collaborate, and continue strengthening the bonds that we’ve built in the virtual world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To the future!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[10 tips to run a successful conversion audit]]></title><description><![CDATA[Discover how Digital Experience Intelligence tools help marketing teams optimize their site or mobile app's conversion.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/marketing-conversion-audits</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/marketing-conversion-audits</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Increase conversion rates with a site audit using a Digital Experience Intelligence solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Does your site have technical issues? Is it confusing to visitors? It may be time for a site audit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A conversion audit is an examination of your site&amp;#x27;s overall performance in regards to how users interact with it—and convert. Audits help marketing teams understand:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s confusing your visitors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why conversation rates are low&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What technical issues exist &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversion audits are great at helping figure out everything that&amp;#x27;s wrong with a site, but outputs can often be laundry lists of small, disconnected problems. Time is best spent fixing problems, not triaging and sizing them up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Start getting to the fixes that matter most by asking the right questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s broken that makes the biggest impact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What fix would have the most benefit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where are the high-value customers encountering problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this article, we’re going to tackle 10 ways a best-in-class Digital Experience Intelligence solution can be used with conversion audits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;10 conversion audit strategies using Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Check for low-performing fruit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Not everyone has the same experiences, particularly when it comes to devices and operating systems. An easy report to generate in Google Analytics is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061755873-Conversion-Rate-by-Location&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conversion rate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for each browser and operating system combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From there, simply search in FullStory by browser and OS to bring up session replays for your lowest-performing combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Patterns will emerge in session replays that can help explain what&amp;#x27;s causing low conversions: perhaps the site loads slowly or the content is cut off. Whatever the case may be, begin formulating a plan to improve the experience for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway&lt;/b&gt;: Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623414-Google-Analytics-Universal&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to see the most popular configurations and then turn to digital intelligence to learn more about how those configurations are changing user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Step into your customer’s shoes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can have a stellar online presence, but it will all be for nothing if customer service is poor. Ask these critical questions about the customer experience: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens when you call your customer support line? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s the experience like? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are users treated in a way that aligns with your brand identity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, a window manufacturing client whose installation team consistently received harsh reviews for their customer service - but does excellent work - undermines the brand experience other stakeholders work so diligently to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/b&gt;One call—that&amp;#x27;s all it might take to identify &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.superoffice.com/blog/five-ways-to-deliver-excellent-customer-service/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer service&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; problems that need attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Schedule website crawl tune-ups &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A few regularly scheduled tune-ups will help make sure your site gives your customers a smooth ride. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/web-crawler&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;web crawler&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a bot that searches and indexes internet content and is responsible for understanding that content so they can retrieve it for inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Best practices are to periodically use a site crawler tool such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepcrawl.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DeepCrawl&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Screaming Frog&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to check for broken links and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Also, pay attention to your key landing pages, and check that you don&amp;#x27;t have content that&amp;#x27;s no longer relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/b&gt; Schedule a website crawl regularly to avoid broken or outdated content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Add and test an ad blocker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The average internet user is said to be exposed to thousands of ads per day. Many computer-savvy customers probably have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://proprivacy.com/adblocker/guides/what-is-adblocker&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ad blocker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; installed. It’s important to know what your site looks like with one enabled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Try using an ad blocker to see if your site still works correctly and key marketing messages are still visible for these users. Because ad blockers block both advertisements and analytics scripts, there could be trouble collecting data that gives insights into visitors&amp;#x27; behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/b&gt;Install an &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/ad-pop-up-blockers/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ad blocker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on your site to confirm links are properly working, pop-ups or CTAs are firing correctly and you’re not missing out on valuable visitors due to browser failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Update metadata &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The conversion funnel often starts on the search results page, before potential customers even get to your site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Optimize your presence on SERPs by writing helpful &lt;a href=&quot;https://loganix.com/seo-meta-descriptions/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;meta descriptions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; using your keywords, along with tags, titles, and categories. Take advantage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/appearance/good-titles-snippets&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google&amp;#x27;s maximum meta description length&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/b&gt;Get recognized in the search engines by adding critical data to your meta descriptions, tags, titles, and categories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. Optimize for SERPs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you can get search engines to select your site&amp;#x27;s content for the top of the page, you have an immediate advantage over your competitors, and the opportunity to begin converting customers before they even get to your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To start, learn how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/optimize-for-branded-search&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;optimize for brand search&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway: &lt;/b&gt;Do &lt;a href=&quot;https://biq.cloud/blog/keyword-suggestion-tool/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;keyword&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; homework on how to answer questions about your brand and incorporate them into your site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;7. Build customer segments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;segment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is any saved search in FullStory. Search for users who took certain steps to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-fullstory-on-funnels/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;funnel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and who meet any combination of demographic or device criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Begin by creating segments for &lt;a href=&quot;https://kickpoint.ca/why-use-personas/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;high-value personas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: the users who are (or could be) best customers. This will help aim the fire hose of session replay data at the most urgent blazes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway&lt;/b&gt;: Learn from &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/learn-from-power-users-and-improve-your-product/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;top users&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Search for their sessions and see how they engage with your website or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;8. Run a conversion rates report&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Run a Google Analytics report to get a list of the pages on your site with the lowest &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2684489?hl=en&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conversion rates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Google Analytics report shows the pages where users struggle, but in watching real users interact with these pages you’ll see the specific reasons why they fail. That&amp;#x27;s where session replay steps in—observe directly what&amp;#x27;s causing poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway&lt;/b&gt;: Use quantitative reports to identify opportunities and then use a DXI solution to see what&amp;#x27;s working—or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;9. Make paid search pay off&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A DXI solution makes it easy to search for and watch sessions of users who arrived at your site by paid search. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Review users&amp;#x27; step-by-step progress, and understand the reasons why they convert—or why they bounce. Refine search results to investigate a specific action or outcome, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020622574-Can-FullStory-show-me-users-who-abandoned-a-form-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;form abandonment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For instance, a session replay can reveal that users are filling out the form but then hitting the “Download PDF” button instead of “Submit.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nuanced behaviors around user experience are hard to understand with traditional analytics but easy to see in a digital experience intelligence platform. Zooming in on user behaviors with replay will help provide much-needed context around conversion numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway&lt;/b&gt;: Search your sessions for those that arrive from paid channels. Optimize the experience so investment doesn&amp;#x27;t go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;10. Listen to frustration signals &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A key strategy in any audit is listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-digital-engagement-signals/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;on-page signals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Search for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: instances when a user repeatedly and rapidly clicks in frustration, which serves as a signal something isn&amp;#x27;t working as it should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider this example of a customer having a disastrous time trying to select their seat at a client&amp;#x27;s concert hall site. They click everywhere trying to select a seat, their frustration mounting, but nothing works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As painful as this session replay is to watch, it helps get to the bottom of the problem: a bug with the ticketing software that the concert hall used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway&lt;/b&gt;: Sessions that include frustration signals are opportunities for quick wins. Search the DXI platform sessions for on-page signals like Rage Clicks and fix the error immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Put these audit tips to work and boost conversions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Site audits are great but they&amp;#x27;re time-consuming and can leave you wondering where to begin. Use these tips to focus your efforts.

Even for the most digital-savvy e-commerce firms, marketers have to resort to complicated and expensive ways to collect otherwise uncollectable data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What makes attribution so hard?&lt;/b&gt; Leads don’t always originate from a single source or even from a source you can clearly identify. For example, many leads originate offline, either &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/why-is-customer-experience-so-important-word-of-mouth/&quot;&gt;via word-of-mouth&lt;/a&gt; or conferences, so how do you properly attribute credit to these sources when the only trackable last-click came from a Google search ad?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Moreover, how do you ensure that measuring attribution and the worth of each acquisition channel does not succumb to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)&quot;&gt;observer effect&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/combating-bias-in-user-testing/&quot;&gt;the Hawthorne effect&lt;/a&gt;)? Your questionnaire is no good if it causes many of your customers to turn their back on your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As hard as proper revenue attribution can be, it can make the difference between your marketing team being seen as a cost-center or bread-winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Launching a survey&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The good news is that your marketing organization can take relatively simple and inexpensive steps to dramatically increase lead visibility. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#x27;ve known that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;our session replay tool&lt;/a&gt; fell within a class of products in which word-of-mouth is a critical source of attribution leads. But as the company has grown, our assumed knowledge became insufficient. We needed to precisely measure offline conversions. Moreover, we worried a lack of data could lead to missed opportunities or waste valuable marketing resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We considered a few options to measure attribution, such as having our sales team ask their leads about how they heard about FullStory, or sending survey emails to all of our customers. But these tactics could only reach a small subset of our entire customer base. We were also concerned about a potentially low response rate or, worse, annoying users. Survey responses notoriously have their flaws—it’s always better to observe what users &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; rather than what then record what they &lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt;. However, despite potential noise, we knew that the survey would give us some hint about our current acquisition channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After careful consideration, we decided to test out a survey on our marketing site. We took steps to only present the survey at a moment when it was least likely to disrupt the customer experience (while still being timely).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Survey setup&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s how we did it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We launched an experiment by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/announcing-fullstorys-optimizely-integration/&quot;&gt;Optimizely&lt;/a&gt; to redirect half of our customers to an optional customer survey &lt;b&gt;right after signing up&lt;/b&gt; (and before activating their account). We used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jotform.com/&quot;&gt;Jotform&lt;/a&gt; to create 12 response choices (a user can select as many as they like) and a text form for respondents to provide additional information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The rationale for the placement was that we wanted the survey to show up early enough to be close to the point of conversion (“signing up” in our case) but not disrupt the onboarding experience after account activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s what the user flow looks like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sign up:&lt;/b&gt; The user enters their email and hits the “go” button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Survey page:&lt;/b&gt; The user is prompted by a call-to-action to check their email for an activation link, but also has the opportunity to fill out the survey if they would like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thank you page:&lt;/b&gt; If the user decides to fill out and submit the survey, we thank them for taking the time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Pleasantly surprised by results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The results far exceeded our expectations, with over 3 out of 4 signups who got the survey submitting a response. This caused us a little anxiety at first, as we considered the result too good to be true for an optional poll. However, we created a FullStory segment for these users, watched several of their sessions, and realized they interacted with the form as we&amp;#x27;d hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The survey helped us understand several things about our customer base:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our intuitions about word-of-mouth were correct. The largest percentage of respondents indicated that they learned about FullStory through a colleague or friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The open-response helped us discover several digital channels we hadn’t attributed leads to, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/ran-calls-fullstory-best-ux-tool/&quot;&gt;Ran Segall’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and Neil Patel’s  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.singlegrain.com/episodes/marketing-school/7-unusual-marketing-tools-thatll-help-you-grow-ep-588/&quot;&gt;Marketing School Podcast&lt;/a&gt; (Episode 588). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other interesting lead discoveries included previous employers, industry events, and even developers exploring a website’s JavaScript console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Do no harm?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite revealing useful insights, did the survey detract from our users’ experience or prevent our sign-ups from activating their trial accounts? Here, we turned to FullStory, searched for sessions in which the survey was answered, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/why-you-cant-do-a-user-interview-without-skin-in-the-game/&quot;&gt;observed real user behavior&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although users generally navigated our survey seamlessly, &lt;b&gt;we found some potential friction points&lt;/b&gt; we feared could potentially sidetrack some users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, we noticed that users seemed to click on the “Thanks” element (shown above), even though it was not a button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our Top Dead Clicks for the survey respondent segment in FullStory confirmed our suspicions: The “Thanks” element was misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the conversion rate differential between our test (those who saw the survey) and control (those who did not see the survey) groups was not statistically significant, leading us to conclude (for now) that &lt;b&gt;the survey did not have a meaningful impact on our conversion rates&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, FullStory lets us track and search for for almost all UX metrics via &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;OmniSearch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-fastest-funnels-on-the-web/&quot;&gt;funnels&lt;/a&gt;. We further checked in FullStory to see if users exposed to the survey had a lower rate of recording and playing sessions, and again to our relief, they did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Applying to business metrics using FullStory Data Export&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ideally, we wanted to incorporate the survey results into our broader business metrics in order to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimize our marketing resources to the right channels where people are most receptive to our product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate new ideas and test new channels as our company scales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the survey data to calibrate quantitative models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we are heavy users of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-data-export/&quot;&gt;Data Export&lt;/a&gt;. We use it to pipe indexed user event data from FullStory.com into Google BigQuery. From there, we query the data and match survey results with the costs and revenue we earn for each channel. In fact, using BigQuery, we’ve built a pretty handy dashboard that can tell us the ARR (annual recurring revenue) and CAC (customer acquisition cost) for our main digital acquisition channels, coalesced with some of the categories selected on the survey. Among other useful insights, we identified conferences we&amp;#x27;ve sponsored that led us to big accounts—so we’ll be sure to sponsor and attend them again next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our efforts here were just a start. We&amp;#x27;ll continue using FullStory to figure out which product features offer the most value to certain audience segments. This will help us refine our message and present only the most salient use-cases to potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to use desire paths to amplify digital experience]]></title><description><![CDATA[Architects and planners use desire paths to map how in-person spaces are used.

As students made their way from building to building across the lawn, they left a trail over time. Only then did the university have the paths paved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Essentially, even the best-planned walkways would be inferior to the ones chosen organically by students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, what does a desire path have to do with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI)&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finding desire paths in a digital world&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Desire paths are powerful because they don’t require you to know any answers in advance. &lt;/b&gt;Simply give an audience an objective, allow them to find a way to achieve that objective, observe what they do, and then make their solution better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Then you pave the paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As useful as desire paths can be for landscape architects who design physical spaces, digital space desire paths are considerably harder to see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Users can&amp;#x27;t blaze a trail through JavaScript and HTML. Plodding mouse movements, swipes, and clicks of users don’t cut desire lines into the browser or the workflows of a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unlike OSU, how do &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/product-manager-workflow-habit-loop/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;product managers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, UX designers, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/engineers-guide-dxi/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;software developers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; see their users’ desire paths if they never get made?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The answer lies in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/finding-dxi-signals-through-the-noise/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;on-page signals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Transforming rage into intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On-page signals, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, occur when someone clicks repeatedly on some part of your site or app. They&amp;#x27;re about missed expectations and unfulfilled desires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rage Clicks have many causes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from confusing UI to slow-loading videos. Users repeatedly click on a button, link, badge, or icon, thinking it will take them to Point B only to find the element is not reacting the way they want, and they&amp;#x27;re stuck with a bad digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the power of a DXI solution such as FullStory, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaying customer sessions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; creates a desire path. By paying close attention to what users were doing before the onset of their rapid-fire clicks, the hidden intent reveals itself and solves the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are other ways to reveal a desire path. Common &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/user-interface-elements.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;UI elements&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; across web applications, websites, and mobile apps, come loaded with expectations and users expect clicking on an avatar will produce a result.

It helps reveal the intent behind the behaviors of users as an &amp;quot;outcome-driven&amp;quot; approach to building products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“To understand what motivates people to act, you first must understand what it is they need to get done.

Are these signals outside this site or app?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Are these on-page signals happening outside your app and on other elements of the web? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Imagine how a Rage Clicked element might be used outside of your site or app. Placing yourself in this mindset, consider what users might have tried to do the last time they clicked that type of element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. What are other users doing?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If a user has found a Dead Click, then suddenly navigate a series of menus at speed, it may be that it’s taking them “the long way” around. Compare their overall journey with that of other users to see if there&amp;#x27;s a correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Do they search?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a DXI solution, you can use search to provide clues about what users really want—or their desire path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Examining sessions in FullStory that include interactions with your search bar can be a useful approach to surfacing desire paths entirely separate from using Rage Clicks. See also how Google is an engine for creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-are-desire-paths-and-how-use-desire-paths-for-design-and-development/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;desire paths on demand&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Have you asked them? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If it&amp;#x27;s more than an isolated problem with one user, consider reaching out and asking directly: &lt;i&gt;“What were you doing when you last did this—where were you trying to go?”&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Identifying the user’s mission through the above exercises can help tease out whatever it is that users hoped to accomplish through their Rage Clicking, Dead Clicking or Cursor Thrashing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The key is in identifying intent—the Job to Be Done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you can identify that job, you’ll see the desire path carved into your digital landscape.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Experimenting with paved paths to perfect digital experiences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you’ve made the shift from Rage Clicks to identifying candidates for digital desire paths, you have what you need to start testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Run experiments. You can integrate services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624054-Optimizely-&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Optimizely&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with FullStory’s Digital Experience Intelligence platform to create experiments that will help validate or disprove your hypothesis. Choose from an ecosystem of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to easily access the information needed, no matter where your team spends their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once your experiment is up and running, use search to find and analyze sessions of users who interact with your proposed &amp;quot;paved path&amp;quot;. If you find the digital experience is improved by your test, pave that desire path for everyone. Make the experiment part of your product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a best-in-class DXI solution, desire paths are carved, jobs are done and customers are happy.

Getting the big picture is important, but we found we were always left with more questions. For example, “why?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We love helping customers answer the “why” questions at FullStory. Why does this customer keep reporting problems with the signup form? Why did she miss the “Add to Cart” button? Why did that customer stop making purchases 2 weeks ago? Actually, we like answering all the questions, but we are particularly interested in “why.” That’s why (zing) we built an integration with Google Analytics Universal that lets you use the FullStory Session URL as a custom dimension within Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re already using Google Analytics Universal and want to check out the integration, you simply need to flip a switch from your FullStory settings page (&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623414&quot;&gt;full instructions here&lt;/a&gt;). Once you’ve authenticated the connection between FullStory and Google Analytics, you’ll be able to use the FullStory Session URL custom dimension anywhere you can use a dimension within Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s How We Use It.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory we’re frequently watching the referrals section of Google Analytics to see how people are coming to our site. Often we see something unusual that we weren’t expecting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, we recently noticed quite a bit of traffic coming to our app from Evernote. Naturally, we wondered why. Did Evernote mention us in a blog post perhaps? Or was it something else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before, we would’ve needed to make some educated guesses about what was going on. But now we can just add the FullStory Session URL as a custom dimension and pick a few sessions to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Lightbulb!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Immediately, we saw that these were FullStory customers jumping directly into their own user sessions in their own FullStory accounts. Lightbulb! Our users track and share interesting FullStory sessions in Evernote. That makes perfect sense in retrospect, but without the integration we’d only have been able to guess, or do some additional legwork.[1. Just as a quick note, you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; find the sessions of users coming to your site from a referrer in FullStory by searching for “referrer URL has host www.evernote.com.” But without Google Analytics, we wouldn’t have known to look for it. The integration saves us several steps because the URLs are right there in Google Analytics where we’re already looking.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that we know for sure, we also know that an integration with Evernote could make this behavior even easier for our customers. As someone working on integrations and partnerships here, it’s super valuable to have this kind of data to inform our integration roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We are excited to see that so many of our users have already installed the integration (this is one of our favorite ways to use FullStory at FullStory) and we’d love to hear how you and your team are using it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Declaratively reindexing billions of documents]]></title><description><![CDATA[An example of how we built a declarative reindexing framework to reindex billions of documents with zero query downtime. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/reindexing-at-scale-and-performance</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/reindexing-at-scale-and-performance</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Milan Patel]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we run real-time ETL pipelines to power our search and analytics features: as data comes in, we instantly index it and make it available to our customers. Shipping new search features is then simply a matter of shipping new code to our production data ingestion and search pipelines. That raises some questions: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you backport a new feature to all of the customer’s old data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or even backport a bugfix that caused the search pipelines to add something like extra whitespace to some text fields?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you do that while avoiding downtime and keeping search and analytics available for the customer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you do this without reanalyzing the customer’s entire dataset? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The way that existing large scale off-the-shelf search services handle this to actually drop and rebuild the indices for the affected database fields. This can be incredibly inefficient: you may only need to update parts of the indices since your backport may only affect a subset of the customer’s total dataset. Here we choose to &lt;b&gt;reindex&lt;/b&gt; over dropping the indices wholesale: update the document in-place and merge those changes into existing indices. We combined this with our data migration expertise and built out a declarative reindexing framework to confidently and surgically reindex billions of documents with zero query downtime. Let’s go through a toy example!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Toy Example&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As part of your normal search requirements, you may want to find documents in your dataset that happened within a certain time period. Naturally, you would very likely have a date field in your schema. There are a lot of date and time standards out there so one day when you were setting it all up you picked one, let’s say the RFC3339 date format, and then proceeded to forget about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Assume that many months go by and your systems have accumulated many terabytes of data across billions of documents and a multitude of customers. One day you and your team, due to some customer issue, realize that the RFC3339 standard is too precise and decide that it’s time to switch over to something like RFC822.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;02 Jan 06 15:04 MST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No problem! Should be a quick 5 minute PR to switch out the formats and do a push to prod. But oh no! All customers’ existing data still have the old format, how do we go about fixing that? Well this seems like a task for our new reindexing framework! Okay, that sounds cool but how does it work? The key insight that helped drive the design for this was realizing that almost all reindexing tasks are going to have 3 core stages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding the documents that need to be updated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defining some transformation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sending the document back to be re-persisted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;3 Core stages depicted here. 1. Documents to be updated are queried for and fetched. 2. The user provided transform is applied to all found documents. 3. The final stage sends them back for persisting and merging with existing indices.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Getting back to our toy example, we just successfully pushed out the new date format to prod which means that all documents that were last modified before this afternoon have the old format. Let’s define a query that finds those documents! N.B.: at FullStory, Golang is our backend language of choice, so all code snippets below reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that we’ve found our documents, let’s turn our attention to our document processor. This is the function that will be run across all matching documents returned by the above query and is responsible for handling the backport logic. In this example, it updates the date field to use the format we decided on earlier, RFC822.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Putting it all together, this is what a standalone reindex job binary might look like with the user defined query, the document processor that will update each document to the new date format and the job invocation which handles fetching documents and sending them back to the database!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ok that’s great and all but what’s really going on behind the scenes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reindexing at scale&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each reindex job is deployed in its own container and all containers are running the same code under the hood. This means that every process in a complex multiprocess job initialization routine can operate deterministically where the decisions they make are the same given the same inputs. This is really important in resolving mutual exclusion conflicts and later we dive into how two processes decide what to do when they both want to do the same thing. Ultimately, this enables us to remove any hard affinity requirements: each process and each thread in the process can work on any job partition for any customer, increasing overall system throughput.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each process begins by determining the customers to work on for that job: this information is always pulled from the user defined job specification. It then proceeds to inspect the external state shared across all active processes. Has the affected data for this customer been partitioned out into small parallelizable chunks? If not, let’s go ahead and do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The horizontal line above represents all of the customers data as a contiguous block of data. Each of the vertical lines represent delineations, or chunks, which break apart the larger block into smaller disjoint blocks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nice! But how do we enforce mutual exclusion? Earlier we noted that any process and any thread of execution can work on any customer in parallel and we wouldn’t want processes to partition out a customer&amp;#x27;s data more than once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Multi-process job initialization mutual exclusion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Above we show how we use a distributed barrier algorithm to handle multiple processes attempting to initialize the job state for two customers. The first process to begin working on a customer assumes the leader role and all other processes wait on the leader to signal that the customer’s data is ready to be worked on. The leader is responsible for breaking out the total data for a customer into chunks that all processes/threads can work on in parallel. When it finishes, it marks the customer as ready, allowing for other processes to pass the barrier. It is possible for processes to simultaneously be leaders and followers as depicted with the differential leaders for customer A and customer B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once the job state for a customer has been initialized, each worker is free to claim a portion of that job to work on and the rest moves along naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each thread in a process can concurrently work on up to some max number of chunks. Mutual exclusion for chunks is handled at the coordination layer using distributed locking.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There you have it! What’s really important to note is that all of the resource management, including job partitioning, mutual exclusion, cursoring and error propagation across multiple containers running the same reindex job are all handled behind the scenes by the framework on behalf of the user. Moreover, the reduction depicted in the toy example is no exaggeration: we’ve been able to deploy reindex jobs to our K8s cluster that are less than 100 lines of code which reindex a customer’s entire dataset in a matter of hours. Now that’s cool!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intelligence matters]]></title><description><![CDATA[Introducing our new category: Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI)]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-intelligence</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-intelligence</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Amanda Myers]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;How digital experience intelligence goes way beyond analytics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In 2020, FullStory recorded over 10 billion sessions—a major milestone on our journey to making the digital world a more perfect place. And while that alone is cause for celebration, it also marked the right time to evaluate FullStory&amp;#x27;s evolution from an industry-leading session replay solution to a powerful data engine that informs thousands of leading companies&amp;#x27; digital experience strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After launching with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/what-is-session-replay-useful-for&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offering, we expanded into experience analytics, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/funnel-analysis-for-digital-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;funnels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help understand conversion and user journeys and proactive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/fullstory-digital-engagement-signals&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Signals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (like our signature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to identify points of friction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As our platform has continued to evolve to offer rich insights alongside a strong &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/session-replay-elevates-qualitative-analytics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;set of analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it became clear FullStory was much more than session replay. While looking at pure data analytics can be insightful, it only gives you part of a user’s story. Reviewing session replay details provides invaluable context, but can be hard to illuminate the big picture when considered in a silo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our ability to deliver a powerful combination of quantitative and qualitative data sets FullStory apart—so why were we consistently referred to by less comprehensive terminology?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defining the category&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From research reports to third-party articles, it seemed that nearly every author created their own way to define the offerings in “our space.” But none of them &lt;i&gt;quite &lt;/i&gt;encompassed the breadth of FullStory’s value, so we decided to perform our own exploration to more accurately name a platform that captures quantitative data and provides qualitative context to enable improvements and eliminate blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory surveyed businesses of all shapes and sizes, listening to hundreds of product managers, engineers, customer experience leaders, and executives and others who felt strongly about digital experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We heard loud and clear that digital experiences have become increasingly sophisticated, producing an ever-growing mountain of data about how users interact with your business online. This balance between, and combination of, quantitative and qualitative data was also a theme that came up time after time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The feedback on terminology led us to “digital experience intelligence” (DXI). The &lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/intelligence&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cambridge Dictionary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; defines intelligence as “the ability to learn, understand, and make judgements or have opinions based on reason.” This capacity to provide rich insights around the &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;why &lt;/i&gt;of what your customers are doing, and lead you to make better decisions, is crucial to FullStory’s differentiation—and is what your organization needs to be investing in now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bringing DXI to life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition to aligning systems, digital experience intelligence unifies teams by not only guiding product management work, but also going beyond product improvement to deliver a continuous improvement of the entire digital experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s say an ecommerce product manager is alerted to a high priority issue on their site by a spike in dead clicks on their product pages. In reviewing user sessions, they get additional context: customers get sidetracked by the number of options available and abandon their cart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They bring these insights to their C/X team who mentions that they have a couple of open tickets about this same issue. Having validated the issue with C/X, the product manager reaches out to a mobile engineer and learns they’re also seeing the same trend within the mobile app. The product manager and engineer then work with merchandising to understand what options are truly necessary and share the information with U/X to prioritize streamlining the selection process. Each is working from the same intelligence, knowledge that can inform individual and collective decisions around priorities and next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The result? In addition to an optimized digital experience, DXI supports increased revenue through better conversion, boosts customer growth and retention and improves organizational efficiency. Digital Experience Intelligence also provides teams across the business an opportunity to observe, listen and learn directly from the end user.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Democratizing intelligence across the tech stack &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By knowing what is going on with their customers, and in their experiences, brands can do the things required to enhance and optimize them—across the tech stack and beyond data silos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, in the realm of knowledge, many brands have been practicing customer experience management (CXM) for years. This data is often limited to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/why-customers-dont-come-back&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;tiny handful of customers who actually complete surveys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is often the responsibility of CX teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Similarly, IT solutions to understand underlying uptime and network latency have become increasingly common. Yet again, they typically serve a very specific purpose and audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sharing intelligence across teams and systems is imperative to ensuring alignment around key strategic initiatives that have the customer in mind. Here’s what it looks like in action:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing digital experience intelligence into a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/dx-and-xm-insights-with-fullstory-and-qualtrics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;customer experience management platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/why-customers-dont-come-back&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;voice of the customer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool or applications that help you measure offline interactions provides a more complete view of an experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layering digital experience intelligence over monitoring solutions to fully understand the business implications of poor performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aligning digital experience intelligence with key metrics in your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-data-layer-and-fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;web analytics tool&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides additional perspective into site performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While web analytics are helpful, digital experience intelligence starts with complete, retroactive data collected across digital touchpoints and processed in a privacy-first way. &lt;b&gt;This provides total visibility and informs actionable insights across a user’s journey, and the ways in which digital experience intelligence is made accessible—and useful. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This unified understanding of the customer experience across teams and elements of the customer experience is critical to the action of &lt;i&gt;doing&lt;/i&gt;, which still takes place in key operational systems like your roadmapping and content management tools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For a business to create competitive advantage, it’s important to understand both &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; is happening on your website, app or digital product, and &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;. Beyond just providing session replay, web analytics, or even digital insights (which are great, but very limited), a DXI platform provides complete visibility and informs actionable insights across a user’s journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your digital solutions go by another name, you’re likely missing part of the story. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/platform&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read more about DXI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;get a demo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of our platform and learn more how to get the full story. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Expert insights: How industries adapted DX in 2020 and beyond]]></title><description><![CDATA[Digital leaders from three industries explain how their teams pivoted to address the Covid-19 crisis. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/adapting-digital-experience-for-the-future</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/adapting-digital-experience-for-the-future</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Madison Eubanks]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 20:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article Summary: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;At our annual Company Kick-Off, FullStory CMO Kirsten Newbold-Knipp sat down with three digital experience experts to talk about how their organizations have pivoted to adapt to the Covid-19 crisis. The panel included Matt Eaves, VP of Digital Marketing at University Hospitals; Bobby Stephens, Partner, Digital and Consumer Insights at Deloitte; and Sean O’Brien, CMO and CTO at Modloft. Here are some key takeaways from their conversation. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Check out the webinar, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/digital-business-how-industries-adapted-dx-in-2020-and-beyond&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Digital Business: How Industries Adapted DX in 2020 and Beyond&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, to watch their full conversation. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s been said time and time again: The past year’s events have brought about unpredictable changes across all industries. Some–like major online retailers and virtual meeting software providers–have boomed, while many others–like airlines and brick-and-mortar stores–have fought to stay alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Regardless of size, industry, or “essential/nonessential” status, businesses and business leaders all have one thing in common: they were caught completely unaware by this crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Not only did organizations need to create entirely new playbooks, they needed to create them quickly and while adapting to new work norms. It goes without saying, but that’s a pretty tall order. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;A time for agility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite working in vastly different industries–healthcare, strategy &amp;amp; tech services, and retail–a common theme emerged from the panelists during their conversation: &lt;b&gt;Agility is key. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The ability to pivot quickly is typically aligned with “start-up culture” and SMBs, while medium-sized and enterprise organizations are known to move at a more measured pace. However, the onset of the pandemic forced large companies to exercise an agility muscle that had been dormant at many organizations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“People were adopting more of a small company mantra. ‘Let’s get things out in the market as quickly as possible, let’s look at the data and respond to it &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; quickly,’” Bobby Stephens of Deloitte said. “‘Perfection is the enemy of good.’ That saying was adopted in the industry. It was interesting to see the agile mindset come into play, and to be able to do it virtually.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Matt Eaves at University Hospitals says he empowered his teams to be autonomous in their decision making to make the necessary changes happen quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“People on my team stopped asking for permission and just started executing, and that was really important,” Eaves said. “Even when people did take it a little too far or acted too quickly, the consequence of acting was always smaller than if we’d stuck to our old ways of sending things to a committee to be voted on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“For my team members, I assured them that if they made a mistake I would provide air cover for them,” he said. “When you empower your folks to do what they do best, more times than not they’re going to make the right decision.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Across industries, organizations were setting up programs in a matter of weeks–such as curbside pickup–that would have otherwise taken many months to launch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At University Hospitals, for example, a virtual visit platform was up and running just over two months into the pandemic–a program that Eaves estimates would have taken &lt;i&gt;five years&lt;/i&gt; to implement without the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Similarly, Modloft quickly initiated a “virtual shopping” program that allowed customers to meet with interior decorators, tour showrooms, and purchase furniture via video conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer empathy is a non-negotiable &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customers’ needs changed rapidly throughout 2020, and companies worked hard to meet them where they were through new programs. This challenge was felt deeply by the healthcare industry (which tends to be slower to adopt new digital practices) as they dealt with caring for a huge influx of patients in addition to the pandemic’s many other difficulties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Though many care facilities, like University Hospitals, were able to get virtual visit programs off the ground quickly, getting patients to adopt those programs presented yet another barrier. Visiting a doctor can already be a vulnerable experience–and when you’re visiting that doctor via an unfamiliar platform or technology, that feeling can be greatly amplified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;University Hospitals took action to help their patients feel more comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“[W]e found that a lot of patients were struggling with the digital aspect of this [virtual visit program], so we had our nurses help them learn their way around before meeting with the doctor,” Eaves said. “This helped them get comfortable with the technology faster and support its continued long-term use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Incorporating customer empathy into day-to-day practices like this has allowed many organizations to strengthen their relationships and build customer loyalty during a stressful time, even outside of the healthcare industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;QR codes: An unexpected hero &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Though widely used in Asia for decades, QR codes (or Quick Response codes) had seen relatively modest adoption in the US. However, when the pandemic stifled the use of frequently touched objects like menus, QR codes became a must-have for a variety of businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, at Modloft, O’Brien says his teams implemented QR codes as a way for furniture shoppers to make touchless transactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And during the height of the pandemic, the hospital visiting hours and policies were fluctuating so rapidly that University Hospital employees couldn’t print and hang up signs quickly enough to reflect the changes. To solve this problem, the hospital implemented QR codes that visitors could scan and be immediately taken to a website with the most current information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To say that the pandemic has forced companies of all sizes to innovate is an understatement. But many organizations have turned these challenges into opportunities–to adjust their organizational mindset, create more efficient and empathetic best practices,  and strengthen their relationships with customers long-term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Better customer insights–and the ability to understand the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; behind the &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; of customer behavior–are fuel for an organization’s agility. After all, you can’t adapt to your customers’ needs if you don’t know what those needs are. FullStory enables this much-needed agility by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/the-data-layer-and-fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;surfacing relevant, actionable insights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about user behavior that will help you delight your customers and drive retention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To get the rest of the panel’s expert insights on the pandemic’s impact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/digital-business-how-industries-adapted-dx-in-2020-and-beyond&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;watch the webinar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[SaaS head of product says FullStory brings "blisteringly fast time to value"]]></title><description><![CDATA[Understanding the user experience is hard.

For example, you could create a workflow that initiates whenever your sales team closes a deal in Salesforce. From that event, a new Asana project is created, tasks are assigned to the relevant people in a team, and a new Slack channel is created, with everyone who will be working on the project automatically invited to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We learned about Tray at a recent event when David shared with us how his team had been using FullStory to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/user-experience-ux&quot;&gt;understand the user experience&lt;/a&gt; and improve their product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most striking thing I found from first using FullStory was the blisteringly fast time to value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hadn&amp;#x27;t finished our trial before we had shipped our first feature that was &lt;b&gt;inspired entirely from observing users through FullStory&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read on as David shares the Tray+FullStory story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How Tray solves user experience confusion with FullStory session replay.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I was first introduced to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt; by a Tray customer. We had met to discuss how he was using Tray and what features he&amp;#x27;d like to see in the future. In our discussion, he asked whether we were using FullStory—at the time we weren&amp;#x27;t. &amp;quot;Oh ... &amp;quot; he said grinning, &amp;quot;This is going to blow your mind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;He gave me a demo right then and I signed up for FullStory the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking users doesn&amp;#x27;t always work because they don&amp;#x27;t often dwell on the minor inconveniences or recall the challenges of their first interaction with a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—David Simpson, Head of Product at Tray&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Within an hour of replaying users&amp;#x27; first interactions with our workflow builder, we noticed many users behaving very strangely. The Tray builder allows users to connect their cloud services together in a visual environment. Data can be routed to various services using &amp;quot;connectors&amp;quot; to those services. Users join up connectors into a structure like a flowchart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We noticed that users would sometimes add a new connector to a workflow by dragging it into place but would soon after drag it around the screen and sometimes shake it about. To start with we didn&amp;#x27;t understand what these users were trying to achieve. But then an epiphany: They were trying to delete the connector. The way to delete a connector was to right-click on it but this was really unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We implemented a delete button which appears when the user hovers over a connector. Furthermore, from watching how users interacted with connectors when they wanted to delete them we also decided to change the panels at either side of the builder so that users could drag and drop their connectors to delete them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We see this pattern a lot: not only did FullStory reveal a problem we didn&amp;#x27;t realise users were having, it also hinted at a good solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Going forward, we continue to iterate on Tray, improving the product and the UX based on what we observe and learn using FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanks David and the Tray team for sharing your story!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How often are simple problems in the user experience—things you don&amp;#x27;t see as the designer or the developer—preventing users from getting the full value out of your product?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#what-is-session-replay-useful-for?&quot;&gt;Replaying user sessions&lt;/a&gt; in FullStory is revelatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Teams everywhere &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/use-cases/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;use FullStory to improve the online experience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.

Staring at a queue of emails from customers, your work expands to fill your work day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The inverse of this law is nicely phrased as, “If you wait until the last minute, it only takes a minute to do.” But there is, of course, an upper bound to how much work you can expect someone to absorb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s a fine line to walk: under-provisioning a support agent can lead to wasted potential, as their light workload overtakes their entire week. But piling on too much work leads to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/how-to-avoid-empathy-fatigue-on-your-support-team/&quot;&gt;burnout and empathy fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. You still want your reps to love their jobs by Friday afternoon, not deeply consider quitting on the train ride home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Introducing slack (the concept, not the chat client).&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When accounting for support capacity, good managers know not to expect agents to be in the queue 100% of the time. You’re going to burn out pretty fast if you’re responding to emails from the moment you clock in to the moment you clock out, five days per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Knowing that, you might plan for around 80% of time in the queue and 20% of time for recovery or “other projects.” If you want to dive deep into this topic, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL3kMv2nVQo&amp;amp;feature=emb_title&quot;&gt;this talk from Rich Armstrong (a former boss of mine) at UserConf NYC in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Create focused time outside the queue.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The main takeaway from Rich’s video is that if you dedicate purposeful time away from the queue, rather than just squeezing in a task or two at the end of the day, you can generate a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; more output (and very likely have better job satisfaction).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first step to making &lt;i&gt;slack&lt;/i&gt; (again, not the chat client) work is defining what you want to achieve. At FullStory, for goal-setting and measurement, we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR&quot;&gt;OKRs&lt;/a&gt; to great effect. It keeps us accountable to the rest of the team and there’s a very clear start and end date to each OKR cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you don’t want to jump all over OKRs, just do this: set goals with a due date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Need ideas? How about some of these:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch FullStory sessions of customers reading help documentation so you can improve your docs (extra points if the customer contacted support even after reading the doc!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clean up old macros / snippets / saved replies and remove anything stale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Re-evaluate your metrics to make sure what you’re measuring &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify customer feedback trends and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you know what you want to achieve, figure out how you’re going to strategically pull people out of the queue. Take into account anything that will affect the team’s ability to handle the queue, such as planned vacations, upcoming product launches, or every Monday ever. Start handing out the available days and add them to the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;(Also worthy to note: dedicated time outside of the queue spent on meaningful work is incredibly refreshing. It goes a lot further than $25 gift cards to Olive Garden. But don’t pull the gift cards entirely, ’cause I mean, who doesn’t love bottomless soup, salad and breadsticks?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Measuring output FTW.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I strongly recommend having a forum for your team to share with one another what they’ve accomplished and what may have prevented them from achieving their goal. This type of accountability applies positive pressure, so that when your slack day rolls around, you know what you need to work on and that you’re going to be accountable to your team for that work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you gather to evaluate results and celebrate wins, you‘ll begin to get a sense of your output that is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; responding to emails. Beholding the effect of this &lt;i&gt;extra-queue-rricular&lt;/i&gt; work on your team’s performance, and the effect on improving your customer’s overall experience, is highly empowering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Doing this in a repeatable way creates a history of value associated with spending time outside of the queue. If you keep it up long enough, you’ll find yourself planning capacity around this new value the team is creating, rather than treating it as something you squeeze in when you need a break from answering emails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use Parkinson’s (Inverse) Law to your advantage.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You and your team don’t have to succumb to the effects of Parkinson’s Law. If you dedicate time outside of the queue to focus on clear, measurable goals, you may be pleasantly surprised to find that the support queue continues to stay under control while your output (and overall job satisfaction) increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Such is the power of &lt;i&gt;slack&lt;/i&gt;. Sometimes, less really is more.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[3 product management challenges for improving CX in 2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[Does your team want to improve customer experience in 2019?

It’s an exciting time because it’s an opportunity to set the tone for the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Has your team taken time to reflect and set goals? If not, I get it. All the distractions in the day-to-day grind make it easy to push off. If you need a little nudge, maybe I can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I scoured the web looking for current, useful product management challenges—and possible solutions. After reading this, my hope is you can walk away with actionable insights for making 2019 the best year for your product yet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. How Do I Know We’re Building the Right Thing?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a PM you know firsthand building product isn’t easy, but building is just the beginning. It’s even harder to build the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; product—the kind of product your users actually need and want to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why is it so hard to focus product efforts on building the right things? There’s no right answer—each situation is different. According to Marty Cagan, founder at Silicon Valley Product Group, product management teams often confuse optimization with discovery. He argues that &lt;a href=&quot;https://svpg.com/more-pm-problem-areas/&quot;&gt;product optimization&lt;/a&gt; is important and generally a great practice, but says that this type of work is less likely to uncover key areas to create significant new value: build the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; product rather than just improving a product no one wants. As Cagan puts it, product optimization is &amp;quot;value capture work and not value creation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So how do you uncover areas to create new value? There’s no shortage of tools for discovery: customer observations, customer discovery interviews, and many design thinking empathy activities all come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!
— Theodore Levitt, Harvard Business Professor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One framework we use at FullStory is Clayton Christensen’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/jobs-to-be-done/&quot;&gt;Jobs-To-Be-Done Framework&lt;/a&gt; (JTBD). If you’re unfamiliar what JTBD is, here’s a short explainer: Jobs-to-Be-Done helps teams reveal the high-level reasons behind customer decisions by reframing how we talk about products away from features and toward outcomes. JTBD asks: What job is the customer trying to do with your product? This &amp;quot;outcome-driven&amp;quot; approach ensures teams are building products that solve real customer problems. And sometimes, your customers will be literally &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-and-jobs-to-be-done-reveal-the-hidden-desire-paths-in-your-product/&quot;&gt;rage clicking the job they want to do&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. When It Comes to Customers, “We Need to Talk”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In an episode of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.profitwell.com/blog/customer-research-benchmarks&quot;&gt;ProfitWell Report&lt;/a&gt; Adam Blake, CMO at ThriveHive, asks, “Does customer research matter anymore?” To answer Blake’s question, ProfitWell researched over 3,000 subscription companies and over 1.2 million different subscription consumers. ProfitWell found “executives indicate that 7 out of 10 of their organizations are speaking to less than 10 prospects or customers in a non-sales research capacity per month and note this doesn’t get better with a company’s size.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In other words, whether customer research matters or not, it’s not happening very much. In addition, ProfitWell’s research found a clear misalignment between product team and customer expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Above is the Value Matrix that ProfitWell used to plot responses from 2,500 product leaders. The responses consisted of evaluating the last features each product team created. Those responses were mapped based on the willingness to pay and how much the team cared about building the feature. Each result could be in one of the four quadrants: add-ons, differentiable features, core features, and trash land (that name makes me laugh).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You might guess product leaders would believe they were building features that their customers cared deeply about (right side of the X-axis) and for which they had a high willingness to pay (high Y-axis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You&amp;#x27;d guess this and you&amp;#x27;d be right. Product leaders believe they are building &amp;quot;differentiable features.&amp;quot; Check it out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you can see above based on the location of most of the responses, most product leaders are confident they are building valuable features their customers want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So when ProfitWell tabulated customer responses, were product leaders right? What did customers have to say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s the complete opposite—the results from customers are practically inverted. So despite the confidence product leaders had about what they were building, their customers didn’t think the same. While customers saw a wide range in value, their willingness to pay was low. Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Based on this research in total, Profitwell hypothesizes that product leaders are not spending enough time talking with customers. As a result, they build products their customers don’t want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;ProfitWell concluded:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re in a world where we’ve literally been given the answer to success: understanding our customer ... Not always agreeing, but at least understanding. For the most part we’ve turned our noses up at the notion of actually talking to the people who are ultimately paying us. That’s a scary thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Similar results were found by Alpha in their 2019 Product Management Insights Report. According to Alpha’s research, 86% of product managers say they don’t spend enough time talking to users, even though they agree direct customer feedback is the best source for new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next time your product team is discussing product improvements, ask, “Are we building features that our customers will value as much as we do?” Get out there and talk with your customers. You might just be surprised by what you hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Are We Creating a Thriving Product Culture?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It goes without saying, but creating a place where your team wants to come to work five days out of the week is essential to product success. For that, you need a thriving culture on your product team. Consider the following ideas as ways to improve your product culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Learn to Play Offense&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://svpg.com/more-pm-problem-areas/&quot;&gt;More PM Problem Areas&lt;/a&gt;, Marty Cagan points out that many product teams have a culture of playing defense over offense. He warns that playing defense is dangerous because it leads to a team that’s risk averse—teams that are scared to uphold new ideas and embrace failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Instead, encourage new ideas and learn from mistakes. Need help deciding on what product ideas to focus on? Maybe the Jobs-to-Be-Done Framework can help!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Revisit How Your Team Gets Work Done&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rjs/status/1085295993183195136&quot;&gt;tweet from Ryan Singer&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Product Strategy at Basecamp:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can tell from the replies to this tweet that not everyone agrees. That&amp;#x27;s fine. Not all teams work the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What’s important is that Ryan is willing to question ideas when problems—as evidenced by low morale and frustration—arise. Sometimes it makes sense to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/suck-less-cycle/&quot;&gt;challenge prevailing dogma&lt;/a&gt;, and instead of forcing a system to work within your team, take time to discover how your team wants to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get Out There And Build Great Product!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As roles, industries, and products ebb and flow, product managers struggle to keep up. As you plan to succeed in 2019, ask:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your team focused on building the right thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your team talking to customers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you creating a thriving product team culture?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What other questions are you asking?

We’ll show you a gray, yellow, or green box, indicating whether your site’s tab is focused (the customer is currently in the tab), focused and inactive (the customer’s mouse isn’t moving), or unfocused (the customer is in another tab).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Of course, we wouldn’t want any part of FullStory’s interface to get in the way of viewing your sessions, so if you need to see something in the playback that’s covered by the Go Live bubble, hover your mouse over it and the bubble will become transparent:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How does Go Live enhance integrations?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Several of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003790653&quot;&gt;integrations&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624034&quot;&gt;Olark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623794&quot;&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624434&quot;&gt;UserVoice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020829653-Zendesk&quot;&gt;Zendesk&lt;/a&gt;, place links in your incoming support chats and emails that let you quickly jump into your customers’ latest FullStory sessions. For chat- or phone-based support teams, your customers will most likely still be online when you receive their requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now you’ll have the option to Go Live when you open these customers’ sessions, letting you watch and guide them in real time through the trickier parts of your app, or see the source of their questions and respond on the spot with answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why don’t some of my “online” sessions show the Go Live option?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When viewing a saved segment or search in your FullStory dashboard, you may notice our &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624934&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; indicator. This icon is displayed next to sessions that have had activity in the past 30 minutes and are not yet closed. While the most recent of these customers are likely to be active, enabling you to Go Live, it’s also possible for some to no longer be actively using your app, in which case FullStory will not give you the option to Go Live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The future of FullStory is now!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ready to Go Live? Check out your latest customer sessions and click the Go Live button to be transported &lt;i&gt;back to the future&lt;/i&gt;. (Sorry, couldn’t help myself.) Give it a try, and if Go Live becomes something you and your team can’t live without, email us your story at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hugs@fullstory.com&quot;&gt;hugs@fullstory.com&lt;/a&gt;. We’d love to talk about featuring you in an upcoming customer case study!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building a customer support culture for management and growth]]></title><description><![CDATA[In a survey we strove to understand what skills support professionals want to learn and how they hope to help their careers.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/building-a-customer-support-culture-for-management-and-growth</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/building-a-customer-support-culture-for-management-and-growth</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Results from 2017 customer support professionals survey conducted by FullStory and Support Driven.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In partnership with &lt;a href=&quot;https://supportdriven.com/&quot;&gt;Support Driven&lt;/a&gt;, we sent a survey to 87 customer support professionals to learn more about what the support landscape in 2017 really looks like. We were interested in understanding what skills support professionals wanted to learn, where they wanted to improve, and how they hoped to further their support careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The big question underlying all of these, however, was where do the desires of customer support team members (“frontliners”) and support team leads and directors (“leadership”) intersect — and what can we learn from the areas where these two groups are misaligned?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Clear trends emerged from the wide range of responses we received. In particular, we saw where leadership and frontliner goals can be out of sync. However, thoughtful consideration of each group’s efforts — with a helpful dose of empathy — suggests solutions both roles can take to work together for mutual benefit and the success of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Leadership prizes proactive team members, efforts that scale.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Managers and Directors — a.k.a. leadership&lt;/b&gt; — are mostly removed from day-to-day, hands-on interactions with customers and necessarily rely on metrics and aggregated results of their team to track and understand progress. They have to operate at the level of the big picture. That’s their job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Measurement and scale.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One manager in our survey noted, “Setting up appropriate processes, procedures, SLAs &amp;amp; KPIs for a small support team while being prepared to scale quickly” was both a goal and an area for improvement. A separate team leader noted, “[Better measurement] would enable us to see the impact of work more clearly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Proactive behavior at the front lines.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While scale and measurement are primary areas of focus, surveyed leadership repeatedly brought up a desire for team members to “step-up” and be proactive. One team leader channeled Napoleon Hill’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Law_of_Success#Habit_Of_Performing_More_Service_Than_Paid_For&quot;&gt;Habit of Performing More Service than Paid for&lt;/a&gt;” when they said they wanted to see frontliners “taking initiative to do the thing not specifically specified — because they see it needs to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Increased communication and focus on proactive problem solving within teams came up over and over again. “I want them thinking more holistically and proactively,” stated one manager, while another said, “If there is something you want to do, thoroughly research it, go through the pros and cons, and put together a proposal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One director perhaps summed up the zeitgeist of support leadership saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like my team to learn the value of ownership in their positions. It is easy for them to respond to a ticket and click solved then go home at the end of the day, but if they can understand the impact they can have by checking in with a customer, or taking steps on their own to learn a new skill for the department, it would free up my time as well as make them care more about the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Leadership’s focus on self-sufficiency and proactive behaviors at the front lines was consistent with another theme from management: reduce “hand-holding” — solving individual problems doesn’t scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Support leadership clearly prizes self-sufficiency within their team as it both develops their customer support agents and frees up their time so they can continue to focus on bigger picture problems. If a team member comes forth with a problem *and *a scale-able solution — “that’s a major skill to have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Frontliners want career growth, management clarity.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Support team members — our “frontliners”&lt;/b&gt; — deal with the day-to-day demands of helping customers in need. The queue is always there. The help is always needed now. Putting out fires makes it difficult for frontliners to spend time thinking about leadership’s objectives. Understanding the day-to-day of the frontlines helps frame their perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Looking for career growth.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What concerns support team members on the frontlines most is “owning their career” and self-development:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d like to learn how to take control of my own career in support and build a path for myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our survey found that frontliners want managers to provide them with more clarity around the requirements and goals for their roles — e.g. what they need to do to add more value to the organization and what they could do today to shape their careers in the future. One front liner summed it up saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[My manager] could learn how to help direct my career. I have an inexperienced manager who doesn’t really know which options are available and how to get me where I want to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Skill development.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Not all frontliners are looking to their managers for help in career growth. One respondent noted, “I’d like to learn how to take control of my own career in support and build a path for myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Frontliners also want to become stronger operationally and do more to document the team’s knowledge. “Proper document sharing and more efficient communication strategies are important,” wrote one respondent. Another said that they wanted to learn “how to leverage and add to the resources offered to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Tell me what you want.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Meeting the expectations of your boss is a necessary requirement for success no matter the job, so it’s not surprising that our survey found that frontliners want clear lines of sight into what their manager’s require of them. “My boss could learn how to better communicate expectations and goals,” said one frontliner. “It would help give me some clarity about where we’re going, and how we plan to get there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Marking the gap between the frontlines and support team leadership.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summarizing the disconnects our Customer Support Culture survey brought to light&lt;/b&gt;, frontliners clearly want to progress in their careers but don’t always know how. They don’t focus on or prioritize scaling efforts — and the metrics most important to frontliners are the individual customers they’re trying to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Leadership, in contrast, understands that the individual customer cases combine to create organization success or failure, as measured by efficiency and other metrics. Scale is an important ingredient to optimizing their teams and reducing cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How can these different viewpoints reconcile to build a better customer experience, reduce turnover on the front lines and generally improve company culture?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bridging the gap between frontliners and support team leadership.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For support team leadership.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There is no easy fix for managers here. Managing to the big picture has to be balanced with support for team members. Here are a few suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Work from a place of empathy. &lt;/b&gt;Understand that work at the frontlines of customer service limits your team member’s ability to see the big picture. Give your frontliners a chance to and keep an eye on amongst your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Give frontliners the skills they need. &lt;/b&gt;Build in opportunities for continuing education — don’t just pay lip-service to the idea. Initial onboarding and early training for support team members is important but so are additional trainings that add skills to your team. Investing in your team’s education will ultimately improve the level of support your customers receive. This approach is akin to “teaching a man to fish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be clear in your expectations and give team members more autonomy, not less. &lt;/b&gt;If you expect team members to handle problems proactively and lean on one another for help, make sure they know proactive problem solving is both valued and encouraged. Be clear in your objectives and show your team how their work rolls up into the metrics you manage and how those metrics drive organizational success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Don’t micromanage team members — that will encourage them depend on your judgment, which is the opposite of scale. When the people who are running support can handle themselves, that makes everyone’s job easier — including yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For support team frontliners.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A little help from leadership will go a long way. But team members also need to put in a little more elbow grease to fulfill their duties and keep support running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Work smarter, not harder. &lt;/b&gt;Show your team leaders that you’ve got the initiative they value. Work with your team to identify the biggest problems holding you back from more efficient work and then make a plan to chip away at those. If your current support environment isn’t conducive to this kind of teamwork, put together a researched, thoughtful proposal and present it to your management team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Look for opportunities to scale. &lt;/b&gt;You know that scaling customer support solutions is important to your managers, so when problems occur, don’t stop at the one-time fix if you could turn that solution into a scale-able process. Get in the habit of documenting processes that seem inefficient and proposing solutions that scale. Leadership will thank you for it with career growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The habit of doing more than you’re paid for. &lt;/b&gt;A “Law of Success” from Napoleon Hill that was coined nearly 100 years ago is the. Take control of your career by doing more than you’re paid for and leadership will be quick to notice — and even if they don’t, you’ll have acquired new skills in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Finally, don’t stop asking managers to help you when you truly need it — but make sure you really, &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; need their help before asking. Keep developing your skills and your career and realize the onus of career growth is on you, not your manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bridging the gap takes time. Keep building.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If we’ve learned anything from this year’s support survey, it’s that customer support culture has a good bit of opportunity for improvement with one of the most glaring challenges being reconciling the efforts of leadership and frontliners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bridge the gap. Build mutual understanding through communication and empathy. The end result of working together will be great customer support, a better customer experience, and hitting all the metrics that drive organizational success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Support Driven is an online community for support professionals and they recently launched a &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/supportdriven/sdx-take-your-support-skills-to-the-next-level/updates&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; campaign to help fund a brand new kind of event for support professionals called SDX.

There’s that one feature, requested over and over again by your users, that you haven&amp;#x27;t yet delivered. Because you’re not convinced that that feature is the right solution to your users&amp;#x27; problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For us, this feature request has been Segments Folders. For years, this has been one of our most requested features, sparking passionate debate internally. We struggled to agree on the best way to tackle this feature request and the scope of work sat precariously in &amp;quot;more than a quick fix&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;less than a major arc of work.&amp;quot; It&amp;#x27;s these middle ground features that so often stagnate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Well, today I’m here to tell you that finally … we’re still not coming out with folders. At least not right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And as you now know, we’re rolling out a different way to keep the segments relevant to your team front and center: Starred and Recent Segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Starred Segments&lt;/b&gt; give you, dear FullStory user, greater control over your own FullStory experience so you can visually prioritize the UX issues and projects that are important to you &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With &lt;b&gt;Recent Segments&lt;/b&gt;, FullStory “remembers” non-Starred segments you recently accessed, keeping relevant Segments close by until you decide to star/unstar them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Working as part of a team?&lt;/i&gt; You’ll now be able to see and search for segments created by teammates making it easier to collaborate within FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a product manager and power user of FullStory myself, I wanted to share how we got here—why we believe Starred and Recent Segments is the solution that will make your life easier (even if it isn’t the exact solution you’ve been requesting).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customer feedback and discovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As any product manager knows, the journey to a new feature generally starts with user feedback. At FullStory, we receive feedback in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We get feedback via support tickets submitted through the FullStory app (or by email):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Feedback also get feedback through our in-app suggestion box:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When our sales team gets feedback, they log it in Salesforce:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this case, the request for Segments Folders came to our team often, across many channels. Seems like an obvious, easy win. Give the people what they want, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Except before coronating &amp;quot;Folders&amp;quot; the winner and moving forward, we wanted to be sure this was the right solution to a well-defined problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We had to challenge ourselves and ask: What inherent assumptions do we as a product team have in making these decisions? Everyone at FullStory, for instance, is an advanced user of FullStory. If we aren&amp;#x27;t careful, we can project that on our users. So we put this request through our discovery process at FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first step in our discovery process is to understand if our assumptions are backed up by the data (or if the data tells us a different story). Luckily for us, we can use FullStory OmniSearch (Here&amp;#x27;s a refresher on &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828253-Getting-Acquainted-with-OmniSearch&quot;&gt;how to search in FullStory&lt;/a&gt;) to analyze our user’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assumption 1: Every FullStory user saves their own segments&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our instance of FullStory &lt;i&gt;on&lt;/i&gt; FullStory has over 1800+ segments saved on it (a little overboard, I know). FullStorians are in the habit of regularly creating segments to answer business problems. In light of this, we thought that all of our users were creating and using their own segments as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wrong!&lt;/i&gt; When we dove into our data, we saw that 22% of Segment users &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; click into the segments they created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bear in mind that we’ve been organizing segments in such a way that the Segments a user creates were automatically hoisted to the top of the list in the &lt;b&gt;Your Segments&lt;/b&gt; section whereas segments that a team member created were positioned “below the fold” in the &lt;b&gt;Team Segments&lt;/b&gt; section. This means that for 78% of our users, we don&amp;#x27;t provide any way to quickly access the Segments they reference most frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We also discovered that many of our users had never created their own segment, essentially leaving the &lt;b&gt;Your Segments&lt;/b&gt; view blank at the top of the list. This left us wondering, how can we better use the space now that we know this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Assumption 2: Users reference many different segments at the same time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because our internal instance of FullStory has so many segments and we create segments on the fly, FullStorians tend to juggle 12+ segments at a given time on average. As a result, we assumed that our users would be clicking on this many segments in a given month as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here again, our assumption is wrong!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Data shows that 77% of our Segment users interact with four unique segments in a given month. Expand the scope to seven segments, and we are at 90% of users. Given this insight—that the majority of our users are interacting with fewer than 10 segments on a monthly basis—it became clear this space (and workflow) was ripe for optimization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assumption 3: Canned segments created by FullStory provide ongoing value to users&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Out of the box we offer “canned” Segments for common user cohorts, such as &lt;b&gt;New this week &lt;/b&gt;(new users), &lt;b&gt;Rage clicked recently &lt;/b&gt;(&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;b&gt;Mobile&lt;/b&gt; (mobile users)&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here is a look at how our users engage with canned Segments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The “Everyone” segment is very popular but the other four seem to be taking up valuable real estate at the top of the Segments list, for no good reason. This spurred discussion around whether we should just delete these segments all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But before jumping too quickly to conclusions, we checked in with our Customer Success team and learned that these canned Segments are extremely valuable in teaching first-time users the capabilities of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;search and segmentation&lt;/a&gt;. These segments do provide value, at least initially, but we need to allow users to delete or deprioritize them once they’ve served their purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;From discovery to customer interviews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After vetting our long list of (mostly incorrect) assumptions against the data, we moved on to our next stage in product discovery—customer interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By conducting data analysis before we interview customers, we are able to ask more nuanced questions (not to mention make the most of our precious time talking with customers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now we can focus on &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; a limited number of users create Segments and &lt;i&gt;what &lt;/i&gt;problems they are trying to solve, instead of having to spend a lot of time creating a baseline of understanding. Not only does this foster a richer discussion for both sides, but it also allows us to make the most of the time our customers give us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In our conversations with customers, unsurprisingly, we heard many requests for Segment Folders. After all, that was the feature we were researching in the first place. But, when people started to explain their pain points with Segments, here’s what we heard:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of Segments is overwhelming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t find the segments I care most about quickly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible for teams to work together with segments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We also heard more about what common workflows look like for FullStory users. For instance, teams might be working on time-bound projects and use the same three Segments over the course of several weeks. Or, when collaborating on an initiative in a meeting one team member will save a segment in their account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thinking about Folders in light of this data led to more questions and potential problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if two different teams needed to access the same Segment? Would they both be able to save it in their folder or would they need two Segments for the same search?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who would own the organization&amp;#x27;s Folders? What if a user wanted to organize their Segments differently than their organization’s norm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a list of Segments is too overwhelming, what is stopping a list of folders from getting too numerous/overwhelming?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Given our research, we decided that a different solution would better soothe the customer pain points we had uncovered and better enable their ideal workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And that decision led us to Starred and Recent Segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s next for Starred and Recent Segments?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This new feature may seem like a small tweak, but we believe it’ll make it easier for you to access the FullStory Segments you need, when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For my part, this update has reinvigorated my use of Segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here’s my ask to you: &lt;/b&gt;If we are wrong about not adding Segments Folders, please continue to let us know. This effort was lightly scoped from the outset so that we could launch an update and get feedback as quickly as possible. But that certainly doesn’t mean Folders are off the table. We think they could be a future enhancement and would fit in nicely with the Starred/Recent paradigm we are creating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So keep sending tickets, keep sending your thoughts—let us know how the new system works for you and how we can continue to improve!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How we simulate the customer support queue to hire huggers in support]]></title><description><![CDATA[You want to hire the best in customer support but need a way to test their mettle where it counts: in the queue.

If your new hire is expected to interact directly with your customers on a daily basis, you want to be confident that you are making the right decision for your company &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; for your customers&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When hiring for any customer-facing role at FullStory, aside from checking all of the usual requirement boxes, we index on our watchwords in order to identify if someone is a good fit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are they authentically &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics/#empathy&quot;&gt;empathetic&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do they understand the importance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics/#bionics&quot;&gt;bionic operations&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics/#clarity&quot;&gt;clarity&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yet when it came time to hire for our next Supporter, &lt;i&gt;we knew we lacked a key ingredient &lt;/i&gt;to bake the perfect hiring cake&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You see, we do things a bit differently in Support here at FullStory. We not only believe that it’s important to have time outside of the queue—&amp;quot;extra-queue-rricular&amp;quot; work, as we call it—we bake this time into our staffing projections. This isn’t something we just say we do on paper (or in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/when-working-the-support-queue-less-is-more/&quot;&gt;blog!&lt;/a&gt;), we &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have scheduled time outside of the queue every &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;week&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. What this means is everyone in Support balances time spent in the queue with time focused on the type of work that helps move the company forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/optimize-support-for-performance-and-quality/&quot;&gt;performance-minded approach to support&lt;/a&gt; is a key differentiator for FullStory. It optimizes for quality and speed in the queue while also giving Support the extra resources—time!—needed to be vocal customer champions within FullStory. If Support isn’t taking the time to help make the product better, we’re not doing our jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;High expectations raise the bar for hiring&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our support strategy can make things a bit more tricky for us when it comes to hiring new Supporters. We strive to find that G&lt;i&gt;oldilocks and the Three Bears &lt;/i&gt;type of “just right.” An ideal candidate can &lt;i&gt;get shit done (GSD)&lt;/i&gt; when &lt;i&gt;out&lt;/i&gt; of the queue and be a true Queue Boss (™) when they’re in the queue. Hiring someone for a senior support position can make this even more complicated. This is because as you grow in your support career, you’re more likely to be managing a team and less likely to be in the queue regularly. And while it’s usually more obvious if someone can GSD during the interview process, how do you know if someone can manage a queue?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We kept thinking, “What would happen if we put a &lt;i&gt;real queue&lt;/i&gt; in front of our support candidates?” Obviously we couldn’t just let them loose on our real customers, so how could we possibly see how someone would manage a growing queue? How do they keep their head above water when everything’s on fire? How do they prioritize tickets to know what to work on next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;An ability to create the e&lt;i&gt;xperience&lt;/i&gt; of the queue was the key ingredient—the Madagascar vanilla beans, if you will—we knew we needed to bake the oh-so-perfect hiring cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, what did we do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Enter the support queue simulation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yeah, that’s right. We built the dang thing ourselves. With little more than a spreadsheet and Google Apps Script, we generated real-looking, mock support tickets to port into a test Zendesk instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s how it came together:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We based our mock support tickets on a digital product we knew everyone would have a basic understanding of—Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recipe for our mock tickets called for a scant cup of general questions, a tablespoonful of frustration, and a dash of “This sh!t is broken.” All of the tickets were based off of real Google Doc questions, we even included a mock status-page-worthy issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, having mixed all these ingredients together—until slightly lumpy—we set the timing at which the tickets would hit the inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it came time for each candidate to flex their muscles in a queue, we simply hit the big button in our Google spreadsheet and let the magic happen. And since we specified the timing of the tickets hitting the inbox, as the candidate started working through some responses, more came in, just like a real day in support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Being a Queue Boss™ means being very aware of what’s in your queue at all times, so we were honing in on both prioritization and throughput through the entirety of the hour-long simulation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;So … did our simulation work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You might be wondering, “How Did It All Go?” Well, if I could use an emoji to describe how it went: 🎉&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While most candidates were able to demonstrate empathy and clarity in their responses, very few were able to do so &lt;i&gt;bionically&lt;/i&gt;. Bionically owning the support queue implies strong court awareness of the entire queue, knowing exactly what to prioritize, and moving quickly through each ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the end of the simulation, each candidate had 5 minutes to write a quick outline of how they’d approach the rest of a “shift in the queue” and what they’d do if they were handing off the queue to someone else in the support practice. Having the candidate do the work and then talk about their work gave us the information we needed to understand how they approach work in the queue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We gained so much more insight from the simulation than we ever thought we would. Not only did it give us the confidence that we needed to hire our next Supporter, it gave the candidates an idea of what a real day in the life for FullStory support was like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Win-win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So that&amp;#x27;s a neat trick. What about IRL?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the simulation, alone, didn’t give us &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; we needed to know to decide whether or not we were hiring the right person, it was the key ingredient we were looking for—and our hiring cake finally came out a cookbook worthy level of “Just right.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And after only a few weeks into our new Supporter joining us, she had already surpassed our expectations in the queue. And now, 4+ months later, we’re reaffirmed daily we made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Postscript | You might be wondering ...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wasn’t it a pain to build this thing?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Surprisingly, not at all. It took us less time to build out the content, write the script, and set up the test accounts than it did to actually hold the simulations themselves. We tested the simulation with a past-supporter and current FullStorian first and ironed out a handful of kinks before deciding to move forward. All in all, the entire process from idea to final simulation took less than a week to complete, and the outcome was 100% worth every minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How does support work with FullStory?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This may come as no surprise to some of our more seasoned blog readers, but—that’s right!—we absolutely eat our own dogfood here at FullStory. In support, we really couldn’t do what we do without it. FullStory gives us the information we need to move quickly and accurately help our customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Replaying sessions lends critical context to those sometimes-vague “It’s not working” tickets. It allows us to level up our support game by being able to understand what actually happened before the customer wrote into support. With FullStory, gone are the days of asking for screenshots or to reproduce steps. Never again do you need to worry about directing someone to a knowledge base article they already accessed three times. 😠&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And if you’re in support and want to know how your support team can leverage FullStory, &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/Modern-Support-Stack.html&quot;&gt;explore The Modern Support Stack&lt;/a&gt;: a guide and set of resources focused on helping support leaders build their ideal tech stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;No FullStory customers were harmed in the making of this support simulation.&lt;/i&gt;

FullStory should accept signups from free, non-business email addresses like GMail,” Gio asserted, smiling but serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/giohobbins&quot;&gt;Giovanni Hobbins&lt;/a&gt; is a designer at FullStory, and he made this bold pronouncement only a few months after he started. He was challenging a tenet of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/suck-less-cycle#step1dogma&quot;&gt;dogma&lt;/a&gt; that had been in place since FullStory launched a couple of years prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Gio was a newbie, though. Was it okay for him to be outspoken? If so, and especially if he was right, how could he &lt;i&gt;actually achieve&lt;/i&gt; the change he was advocating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ll come back to Gio and how his crusade turned out, but to do that we have to talk first about the relationship between FullStory Dogma and Prove-Its.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dogma solvent&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In a related post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/suck-less-cycle/&quot;&gt;The Suck Less Cycle&lt;/a&gt;, I talked over and over about “dogma” and how critical it is to be clear about the tenets that teams will use to add constructive constraints to make decisions and guide progress. Dogma is the cornerstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But how exactly do you make dogma a thing? How do you make it, you know, &lt;i&gt;official&lt;/i&gt;? And later on in the Suck Less Cycle, when you start to think some tenet might be wrong, how exactly do you change your dogma in a way that everyone can understand and accept?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Everyone at FullStory knows the answer to that: you call for a Prove-It.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is a Prove-It?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Prove-It is just a meeting. That may sound anticlimactic, but it’s a very special kind of meeting that everyone takes particularly seriously. The purpose of a Prove-It is to make a crisp, binding, company-wide decision about a specific proposition that is being advocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some examples of Prove-Its over the last year or so:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will adopt the “Voltron” Security Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will overhaul the FullStory onboarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will offer a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/introducing-fullstory-free/&quot;&gt;free version of FullStory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And, of course, there’s Gio’s Prove-It:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will allow people to sign up for FullStory using free email providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So, while it’s a “just” a meeting, everyone knows that when they see a Prove-It on the company-wide FullStory calendar, it’s a big deal. A meeting not to be missed if you have any interest in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The anatomy of a Prove-It&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do you actually undertake a Prove-It? It’s meant to be very simple and not-at-all bureaucratic. And, despite the seriousness of how it may look when described clinically below, it actually feels quite friendly and lighthearted in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Prove-Its have 5 parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Proposition&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Prove-It starts with a straightforward proposition–a single, clear sentence–stating what will become true if the Prove-It is approved. Getting this right is critical, because you want everyone to easily understand exactly what’s at stake. It’s also harder than you’d expect, because being starkly opinionated takes a lot of courage. And the clearer you are, the harder it is to dodge pointed critique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A weak, squishy proposition might sound like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s improve support availability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whereas a strong proposition will be unambiguous:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will begin offering dedicated chat support on X date.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s hard to miss what is being proposed in that second variant, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Advocates&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You’ve got a proposition. Now who will actually make the case for it? You and fellow advocates. Typically one person leads the charge, but it’s really helpful to have multiple people who are willing to publicly promote the idea, too. The best advocates are people who can make the case in an objective way. Too much emotion tends to confuse the issue. Advocates should be prepared to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/the-highest-form-of-disagreement/531597/&quot;&gt;steel man&lt;/a&gt; the status quo even as they point out why their proposed change would be better still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Approvers&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Prove-It must have an explicitly named set of approvers. These are the people whose unanimous, explicit agreement you need in order for something to be proved. The best slate of approvers should be those people who need to be fully bought-in so as to ensure the proposition is implemented successfully if approved. For example, when we have “This feature is ready to launch” Prove-Its, we always want to make sure trusted leaders from marketing and sales are approvers because they’re the ones who have to make sure they’re excited to talk to customers about what we’re proposing to launch. If they don’t understand a feature or don’t believe in its value, that’s bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We want approvers to give a public, explicit “Yes, I approved this and want to move forward.” It makes a big difference having them go on the record. For one thing, they pay a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; more attention to the presentation because their name will be attached. In addition, it sends a strong signal to their respective teams that the decision has been well-vetted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Who actually decides who the approvers are? While different companies may have different approaches, at FullStory, we founders reserve the right to specify the set of approvers who must be included for any Prove-It. However, the advocates can choose to include additional approvers if there are other people whose active buy-in they wish to galvanize. Interesingly, although it might sound as if picking approvers could be contentious, in practice it’s never been even the slightest problem for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Attendees&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, almost every Prove-It is completely open for anyone in the company to attend, and Prove-Its are published on our company-wide calendar. Openness is an important aspect of a Prove-It, so that even people who aren’t directly involved can at least see how decisions are made. Attendees will realize that they can contribute to the conversation if they want to. And, at a minimum, attendees will have no doubt that everything has been thought of, debated, and reasoned out. Even people who don’t choose to attend will have strong buy-in merely knowing that they could have attended if they had wanted to. Consequently, they’ll be more likely to accept whatever it is that’s been proved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Meeting and decision&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The meeting itself should be as short as possible, typically an hour and almost never longer than 90 minutes. Keeping the meeting short puts constructive back-pressure on the advocates to have their case prepared in a succinct, digestible form. A slide deck is ideal. It can make the case, with all the supporting data and arguments clearly articulated, is efficient and creates an artifact that you can keep around for the future so that new people (or forgetful future selves) can look back on the rationale for any of your current dogma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You end up with a crisp decision, which is always better than abiding ambivalence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the meeting, the advocates talk through the deck, clarifying any points that are confusing, and then hard questions and a discussion follow. When the end approaches, it becomes time for the approvers to make a decision. If it’s unanimous, the Prove It is adopted and change is ratified. If not, nothing changes. Based on the sentiment from the approvers, the advocates may choose to improve their case and try again later. Either way, you end up with a crisp decision, which is always better than abiding ambivalence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What happened with Gio’s “free email signups” Prove-It?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was something we had done one way for years, yet a brand new person to FullStory was able to change that part of our dogma in a single meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Circling back to Gio and the question of whether FullStory should allow non-business emails. Disallowing free email providers from use in our sign-up form had been our policy for a couple of years. Gio deeply disagreed with that so much that he put together a really thoughtful case. We all showed up, and he just blew us away with his reasoning, and in an hour, we changed our policy. This was something we had done one way for years, yet a brand new person to FullStory was able to change that part of our dogma in a single meeting. It’s cool that Prove Its make those sorts of changes possible. And it sends a message to everybody else that if you have an idea, it can really be heard, and it can really create change in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And that’s perhaps my favorite thing about Prove-Its: anybody can drive them. They’re agnostic to seniority. It’s the antidote for drinking too much of your own Kool-Aid. Everyone has a voice, reasoned arguments rule the day, and you should want it that way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How FullStory enhances Salesforce and deepens customer insights]]></title><description><![CDATA[FullStory works with Salesforce to support customers more efficiently and drive customer success through shared understanding.

The challenge is that support tickets can be terribly vague and unclear—customers struggle to explain just what isn&amp;#x27;t working, or what broke on your site or with your product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Could you take a screenshot?&amp;quot; ... &amp;quot;Could you walk me through what you were doing?&amp;quot; These common support questions have been nearly unavoidable and result in complex, hard to understand answers. They can quickly take a bad customer experience and make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The problem of understanding context around a support ticket goes away with FullStory. With FullStory, you just replay the customer&amp;#x27;s session, watch what they did, and understand exactly what they saw that led to them filing a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How Salesforce &lt;i&gt;Service&lt;/i&gt; Cloud ⇆ FullStory works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the Salesforce Service Cloud integration with FullStory, you never need to ask for a screenshot again. Customer problems automatically have the most recent FullStory session recordings for the user alongside the case.

We were watching their FullStory sessions together and someone super new to FullStory asked me, “Who is this for?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I was super excited to say, “Everyone. Everyone on every team here can find something useful in FullStory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I could say this with some confidence because I know that their business operates in several distinct teams: Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, Product, and Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt; captures everything, it can help provide answers for people in every department — from Marketing to Engineering — across their SaaS organization. The possibilities are endless!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As is often the case, when anything’s possible, it can be hard to know where to start. Cue FullStory Segments to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wait. I can save my own Segments?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A Segment in FullStory is a list of user sessions that match a set of criteria in FullStory. A small set of Segments — including Signed up, New this week, Rage clicked recently, and Mobile — are available for everyone out of the box:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While these “came with the frame” Segments are useful in their own right (and can be further refined through FullStory OmniSearch), the best Segments are the custom ones that you create to answer your own burning questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Creating a Segment in FullStory is like getting an answer from a Magic 8-ball, except you don’t have to shake it and the answers are never hazy. Now that I think about it, maybe the only thing that FullStory has in common with a Magic 8-Ball is that you can &lt;i&gt;ask it anything.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Not sure what to ask? Here are some ideas to help get your gears turning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6 FullStory Segments for SaaS-y Teams.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Are people engaging with our new feature?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helpful for:&lt;/b&gt; Product and Customer Success&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Wouldn’t it be great to know if that new exciting feature you just launched was actually being used? What if you could find out feature adoption rates, find and diagnose sessions of users who are missing out on the new feature, and refine the experience around the new feature going forward?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can easily build a search for users who clicked into [Your New Fancy Feature]. Here’s an example search and Segment from typing “Page Insights” (our targeted feature) into the OmniSearch bar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Above is an example of the Search we ran in FullStory to see sessions of users engaging with FullStory &lt;b&gt;Page Insights&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rather than trying to reconstruct the precise Search, try simply typing the name of the feature into the OmniSearch bar. Alternatively, if you know the link or CSS selector for the element that users would have to click to engage with your new feature, search on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you’ve confirmed your search is pulling the correct Segment, “Save segment …”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Then, name your saved Segment with the pop-up prompt:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Which bugs are affecting the most users?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helpful for:&lt;/b&gt; Customer Success and Engineering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Searching for Error clicks is likely to instantly produce actionable results, but how do you locate the most sessions with the most error clicks? Start with a search for “Error clicks” (just start typing that into the FullStory OmniSearch bar) and it will auto-complete with &amp;#x27;Error clicked anything.&amp;#x27; Enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once the sessions populate, scroll down to the error clicks Searchie (Searchies are those &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.fullstory.com/using-ref/searchies-intro&quot;&gt;search-sensitive charts and graphs&lt;/a&gt;) and click the text for whatever is at the top — that will get added to your search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can then watch a session and see the error if you like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yep there’s that &lt;b&gt;Purchase error click&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Save Segment as:&lt;/b&gt; Known Bug — [On this element]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus:&lt;/b&gt; Integrate with JIRA and send that straight to Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Who should we invite to our next out-of-town event?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helpful for:&lt;/b&gt; Marketing and Customer Success&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Imagine that you’re hosting an event in a specific city and you want to invite your customers or friends who work from that city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Traditionally, you might look to your CRM and pull a list of contacts by company headquarters. Alas, as companies become more distributed and remote-friendly, these HQ addresses can be unreliable or difficult to keep up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What if we could easily pull lists of users based on cities where they’re typically active?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can do this in FullStory by building a Segment of users with an arbitrary number of sessions in a given geography. For example, start searching for “sessions” to pull up the “Total sessions is …” prompt. Enter. Then, search for the geography you’re looking for. (In our example, you see Atlanta):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your final search looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Go ahead and &lt;b&gt;“Save segment …” as:&lt;/b&gt; Users Working from &amp;lt;This City&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Export as .csv&lt;/b&gt; and load into your email sending provider to send them an event invite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pro-tip:&lt;/b&gt; When you send the email you can include a genuinely worded note, “We’re inviting you because we noted that you work out of this area often.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Which users in trials are ready to talk about pricing?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helpful for:&lt;/b&gt; Sales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What about your users who are trialing and might want to talk about pricing? Simply search for the URL of your pricing page (or some other identifying element for pricing) and Segment your customers by those interested in pricing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can refine that Segment further by only looking at users who spent a set period of time. Simply click the &lt;code&gt;…&lt;/code&gt; and set &lt;code&gt;Page Active Duration&lt;/code&gt; to whatever figure you like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Go ahead and &lt;b&gt;&amp;#x27;Save segment …&amp;#x27; as:&lt;/b&gt; Users Interested in Pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.fullstory.com/using/134366&quot;&gt;Use custom vars&lt;/a&gt; to send assigned user as a variable to FullStory; then you can limit your segment to only the people you’re working with directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Who is the Power User in my key account?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helpful for:&lt;/b&gt; Sales and Customer Success&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re curious who the top users are from a given domain, you can simply search for @[The Domain] (Or use custom variables if you’re passing the account ID).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From there, look at the “Top users by total sessions” Searchie:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Save Segment as:&lt;/b&gt; Power Users — &amp;lt;my key account&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. Why did this landing page perform better than the other one?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helpful for:&lt;/b&gt; Marketing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you are A/B testing marketing pages, this Segment could be particularly useful, and is super easy to set-up. Identify the URLs of your two landing pages and segment users further by the behavior you’re measuring (E.g. clicked “Add to cart”). Compare sessions from each landing page and see what’s working and what’s not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You would run the above search &lt;b&gt;twice&lt;/b&gt;. Once for each landing page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Save two Segments:&lt;/b&gt; Landing Page A Landing Page B&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use the funnels Searchie for both segments to quickly suss out which out performed better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Open &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/introducing-page-insights-with-click-maps-and-inspect-mode/&quot;&gt;Click Maps&lt;/a&gt; to see which parts of the page users interacted with the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory Page Insights &amp;gt; &lt;b&gt;Click Maps&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; There’s no special instrumentation required here.

Consider the clownfish, who lives inside the protective, poisonous tentacles of the anemone, shielded from the outside world. (Can you tell I just saw &lt;i&gt;Finding Dory&lt;/i&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Some of us go out of our way to include design in our workflows, but the unlucky among us may never really feel the effects our code changes have on customers, or vice versa, how those customers affect our code changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When we’re siloed away from other departments, user experience and design can become an afterthought in the product development process. And thinking of engineering and design as separate entities ultimately affects both: designers can benefit from engineers’ knowledge of constraints, just like engineers can benefit from designers’ insight into customer preferences and usage patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory we believe the best products are created when every department in a company cares about and strives to perfect the customer experience, and to that end we’re always evolving ways for engineering and design to work together. That’s not to say we’ve perfected the process — there’s still room for improvement — but we try to close that gap between engineering and design a little more with every production cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Start with mocks.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This one might seem obvious, but all too often engineers enter “heads down” mode and bang out entire features on our own, without stopping to get opinions or UX input. When that happens, we expect designers to come in at the very end of development, wave their magic wands and make it look good, as if their job were to put a coat of paint on a newly-built house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s no better way to involve design from the get-go than to start with visual mock-ups of the product or feature. It starts a dialogue between engineering and design. What are the constraints that make the mock-up possible or impossible to execute? Why would customers prefer to do it this way versus another way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you start building the feature, don’t stop trading ideas with your designers. Keeping that dialogue open is the only way to make sure that when you inevitably hit a snag in development, neither you nor the design team veers off the course you set together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Details matter.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s tempting to think of ourselves as mind readers when we’re building out a product. We know what the customers want, or what they &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; they want, or what &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; think &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; think they want, and we’re pretty sure we know what we have to create to help them accomplish that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But the specific details of the interaction matter more than we’d like to think. Designers have a particularly good handle on our customers’ preferences and behaviors, since they either work closely with the UX team or &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the UX team. If there’s ever a question of where the button should go, or what order the steps should go in, or when the customer should be presented with a certain option, your designers are the best people to help you frame, research, and understand the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Think like a user, not an engineer.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We have a hard job. We take an idea that has no physical form, write dozens or hundreds of lines of code (along with unit tests and pages upon pages of documentation), and create something that never existed before. Most end users know, on a theoretical level, what it is we do at our jobs, but the finished product in their hands is powered by black magic as far as they’re concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customers, therefore, have little to no appreciation for how difficult it is to make a piece of software or new feature. But why should they? Just because it was hard to make doesn’t mean it works well or measurably improves our customers’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our designer teammates help us put on our user caps. That might mean we find ourselves putting extra work into a feature to make it fall more in line with customer expectations. But it’s always better to build something that people will use, even if it takes more time. Any time spent on a feature customers don’t use (or even worse, hate!) is time wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Don’t be afraid to suggest changes.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is a great reason to work with designers early and &lt;i&gt;often&lt;/i&gt;. We don’t have to be slaves to the designer’s initial mocks — like I said in the first section, starting with mocks is an exercise in communication and compromise. There can and will be unforeseen engineering restraints or sudden strokes of genius that send us ricocheting off in a new direction. But keeping an open dialogue with the design team means that you can suggest changes and updates to the original plan without surprising them at the finish line with a feature they’ve never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s also worthwhile to note that we’re the foil to our designers’ pie-in-the-sky, idealistic aspirations. If their mocks are completely unachievable, we’re the ones who can tell them so, along with the reasons why. Design and engineering are all about iterating, iterating, iterating until you get it right, and working closely is the best way to make sure one department isn’t fading out of touch with the reality of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Do you have the engineering/design dream team?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These are just a few of the ways we work together at FullStory. In the spirit of software development, we’re always iterating, both on our product and our company dynamics. In an upcoming blog post, we’ll talk about how we work cross-departmentally in *themes, not teams *and put all of what we talked about above into practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Do you find you work better in cross-departmental teams, or are your disciplines siloed away from one another?

Even development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now now, I know what you’re thinking: a tool for recording and viewing customer sessions must be for designers and product managers only. But I can tell you (as an ops engineer myself) FullStory also lives solidly in the realm of debugging and development tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In fact, FullStory goes way beyond standard debugging tools: we &lt;i&gt;capture the bug happening&lt;/i&gt;, like trapping a firefly in a jar. As such, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/debugging-with-session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay can be an incredible debugging tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;JIRA and FullStory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With FullStory + JIRA, each time you receive a ticket through support or any other channel, you’ll have the power of FullStory to fill you in on the details. &lt;i&gt;I can’t reproduce the bug&lt;/i&gt; is no longer a thing when you can see every user action and DOM state leading up to the critical moment, review the JavaScript console in sync with the playback, easily correlate problems to your server logs, and even get the relevant customer information such as browser, OS, user-agent, display size, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read on to find out what the JIRA integration can do for you.

This perspective is changing, however, as teams across the business recognize the need to understand how performance impacts the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For instance, website performance influences revenue through things like conversion rates, shopping cart size or abandonment, customer loyalty, brand awareness, and other KPIs. At a high level, this is why Chief Revenue Officers care about performance. They want to know if something is broken and preventing customers from checking out, or if slow speeds are throwing a wrench in their revenue targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In marketing we have similar concerns. Traditional APM or front-end monitoring solutions provide visibility into how our website is performing over time—and are certainly critical for our engineers—but they don’t provide the user’s context or their experience, which is what you care about most as a marketer. And it’s why we use FullStory’s new Dev Tools to optimize performance for conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dev Tools to analyze the impact of performance on conversions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We know that slow loading pages impact conversions, but how might page speed impact our users? FullStory is a SaaS product, so we FullStory marketers want potential customers to give it a try through a free trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To understand the impact of performance on this conversion path, we search in FullStory for users who visited our pricing page, had a first contentful paint (“FCP”) time of over 3 seconds, and gave us their email address to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Looking at the resulting funnel in FullStory, we see 15% of the people who visited the pricing page experienced a FCP of more than 3 seconds. Even though it only impacts a fraction of our users, what’s alarming is when we look at how many of the affected users convert: 7%. Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This seems really low, but how does it compare to people who had faster FCP times? Changing the search parameters to look at users who had FCP time of less than 3 seconds we see conversions jump to 16%. This simple analysis confirms page performance materially impacts our most mission critical pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what do we do next? Returning to FullStory, we dig into these slow pages further by filtering by device type. As expected, the slower sessions were more likely to be found on mobile devices. And additional analysis reveals desktop users with subpar FCP timings were mostly located overseas where slow Internet connections are likely culprits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From performance replay to performance results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From within a replay of a particularly slow session, we can check the Network tab for any intel about other causes, such as unoptimized images. If there was something lurking there, we could create a note or JIRA ticket and share it with one of our marketing developers to take a look at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using the data revealed by FullStory Dev Tools, we’re able to make informed decisions about optimizing our most essential pages—and the broader user journey. For instance, we can build a case for improving the mobile experience. Or keep an eye on how a page is performing in certain geographies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Context you can take to action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory’s Dev Tools give you the context of session replay, the data you need to improve (with page speed metrics, network requests, and error logs), and the ability to search on all of it to see how many users are affected. For CROs and others who care about generating revenue, this information helps identify areas of user struggle and take action to ultimately improve conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If &lt;b&gt;you&amp;#x27;re new to FullStory&lt;/b&gt;, start your free 14-day trial of Dev Tools and replay performance so you can improve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And if &lt;b&gt;you&amp;#x27;re already a FullStory customer&lt;/b&gt; on a paid or free plan, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/contact/dev-tools/&quot;&gt;request a Dev Tools trial&lt;/a&gt; to see how it works for your team.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Could empathy be the secret to happier customers and higher profits?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Empathy is more than a feel-good word for connecting with others—it's the key to building digital products and experiences customers love.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-empathy</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-empathy</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Voigt]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2019 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here at FullStory, we go all in on empathy. We preach it. We practice it. Our product was built for it. During interviews, we gauge prospective employees for their levels of it. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics/&quot;&gt;our three core principles&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll find &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/watchwords-empathy-clarity-bionics/#empathy&quot;&gt;empathy&lt;/a&gt; listed first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What drives our emphatic embrace of empathy? The answer is simple: We believe it’s almost impossible to create great customer experiences and user-friendly products without it. And in today’s heightened customer-centric environment, delivering in these areas is absolutely essential for businesses to separate themselves from their competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;We believe it’s almost impossible to create great customer experiences and user-friendly products without empathy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this post, I’ll recap my talk from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.optimizely.com/opticon/sessions/using-empathy-to-build-better-digital-experiences/?gate=attendee&quot;&gt;2018 Opticon Conference&lt;/a&gt; and give you specific ways you can tap into the power of empathy to build better products. You’ll get a feel for how using empathy and data together is the perfect combination for producing results that matter: enthusiastically happy customers and incredible business growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From Sympathy to Empathy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What&amp;#x27;s the difference between sympathy and empathy, and why do we focus on the latter? To have sympathy means you feel sorry for someone else&amp;#x27;s misfortune. But to have empathy, you&amp;#x27;ve got to be willing to dig a little deeper. You have to feel someone else&amp;#x27;s misfortune as if it were your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As research professor and best-selling author Brené Brown explains, empathy goes further than sympathy because it bridges the gap between the person experiencing difficulty and the person responding to it. Whereas sympathy is more of a &amp;quot;spectator sport,&amp;quot; practicing empathy means that you meet someone where they are by first connecting with something in yourself that knows the same feeling. It&amp;#x27;s more vulnerable, more personal, and much more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;Hear Brené Brown explain it in her own words&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I always think of empathy as this kind of sacred space when someone’s kind of in a deep hole. And they shout out from the bottom and they say, ‘I’m stuck. It’s dark. I’m overwhelmed.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;And then we look and we say, ‘Hey, [as we climb down into the hole with them], I know what it’s like down here. And you’re not alone.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Empathy is a choice. And it’s a vulnerable choice. Because in order to connect with you I have to connect with something in myself that knows that feeling.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Empathy draws its power from going beyond simply acknowledging a problem at a distance to internalizing another&amp;#x27;s problem as your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How Can Software Help Make Practicing Empathy Easier?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So we understand the power of empathy. But how do you invoke that power when building products? To answer this question, let&amp;#x27;s first talk about the two kinds of empathy: &lt;b&gt;affective&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;cognitive&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Affective empathy&lt;/b&gt; is more inherent. It&amp;#x27;s part of who you are as a person. It explains why some people are more likely than others to cry during sad movies; when a character suffers a breakup, for example, someone who has affective empathy might automatically release the floodgates right along with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cognitive empathy&lt;/b&gt;, on the other hand, is more like a skill. It&amp;#x27;s something you can learn, practice, and hone. And just like any other discipline, it becomes easier when you have the right tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yes, tools—and specifically FullStory&amp;#x27;s platform—can help you empathize. How?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We capture the entirety of each customer&amp;#x27;s digital experience, just how it happened, making it easy for teams with a stake in that digital experience to reproduce it. Our technology essentially lets you try on your customers&amp;#x27; shoes and walk a mile in them. And when you experience &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; experience, the vicarious result is, well, &lt;i&gt;empathy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watching a replay of someone&amp;#x27;s digital experience is so immersive it&amp;#x27;s revelatory. It&amp;#x27;s common for people to literally exclaim, &amp;quot;Aha!&amp;quot; while playing back a customer&amp;#x27;s experience. And when those experiences are bad, they&amp;#x27;re groan-inducing bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You feel it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Make Frustration Signals Your Friends&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s pretty amazing what happens when you can finally see your customers&amp;#x27; struggles and desires unfold in crystal clear detail. With traditional, &lt;i&gt;normal&lt;/i&gt; analytics, you have an idea of how many customers encounter an error or issue. But you have no idea what that bad experience truly was like for them—or how frustrating it must have been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Did you know that when a customer&amp;#x27;s experience on your site or app doesn&amp;#x27;t go as planned they actually, literally try to convey how they feel? It&amp;#x27;s true:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;... They may get frustrated and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;rage click&lt;/a&gt;.
... They may get confused and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/#dead-clicks&quot;&gt;dead click&lt;/a&gt;.
... They may get fed up and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/#form-abandonment&quot;&gt;abandon a form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;All of these are examples of &lt;b&gt;digital body language&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;frustration signals&lt;/b&gt; that in the past have been difficult for analytics to pick up on or explain. Yet with FullStory, you have the technology to analyze these signs of frustration in aggregate &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; replay individual experiences, as needed, so you can see what it is your customers are trying to tell you. The best part? With the insights you get from empathy, you both know how to respond as well as have a sudden, strong motivation to take action and make the necessary fixes immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How You Can Solve Every Experience With Empathy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Whether you manage an eCommerce site serving millions of shoppers or a SaaS product relied on by a dedicated set of loyal customers, empathy for the digital experience works to unite your teams around the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider how everyone from product managers to customer support agents, designers to marketers, and more can activate the power of empathy to understand and improve the digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product teams:&lt;/b&gt; For your &lt;b&gt;product team&lt;/b&gt;, having a finger on the pulse of the customer&amp;#x27;s experience is the secret ingredient to building something truly exceptional. While measuring engagement—your daily active users, conversion rates, Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Conversion Score (CSAT), etc.—is a critical step, it&amp;#x27;s just the beginning. From there, being able to dig deep into your digital experience, analyzing engagement at the level of your most loyal customers—or replaying sessions from the onboarding of new customers—that&amp;#x27;s the kind of nuance you need to solve for a better digital experience. The blend of being able to search and analyze the experience quantitatively while also being able to dive deep into the empathy-laden qualitative experience—that&amp;#x27;s what FullStory was made for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Support Teams:&lt;/b&gt; When the customer experience goes wrong, your &lt;b&gt;customer support team&lt;/b&gt; is there on the front lines ready to make it right. That&amp;#x27;s why giving them the tools to understand everything that customers go through is so vital to CX success. Thankfully, through integrations with platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/integrate-with-fullstory/#help-scout&quot;&gt;Help Scout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/integrate-with-fullstory/#zendesk&quot;&gt;Zendesk&lt;/a&gt;, support tickets link directly to the replay of the customer&amp;#x27;s struggle. Agents see exactly what&amp;#x27;s going on and how to solve issues without the need for back-and-forth. That&amp;#x27;s profoundly empowering. For support professionals, it&amp;#x27;s game-changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As for empathy? Your support team will be able to relate to the customer on the other side of the screen—because they&amp;#x27;ll &lt;i&gt;feel &lt;/i&gt;their struggle and &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developers:&lt;/b&gt; Things just get better from here. Deploy empathy to your &lt;b&gt;engineers.&lt;/b&gt; Show them exactly what software bugs look like from the eyes of the customers who experience them. You&amp;#x27;ll be able to say, &amp;quot;We have this problem. This is how many people are experiencing it. &lt;b&gt;And here&amp;#x27;s what it looks like.&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your engineers won&amp;#x27;t have to guess anymore. They&amp;#x27;ll have all the info they need to reproduce the bug. And just like support, the empathy engine will kick in and your developers will want to solve the bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Design and UX:&lt;/b&gt; Go ahead and put some empathy jerseys on your &lt;b&gt;design&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;UX teams&lt;/b&gt;, too. As they watch sessions to see how customers interact with the latest landing page, redesign, or A/B tests, they&amp;#x27;ll be able to understand UX gaps and breakdowns in the conversion funnel and be better able to identify with the people they design for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;... And Anyone Who Has a Stake in the Digital Customer Experience.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I could go on. Sales, marketing, customer success, the C-Suite—everyone can benefit from this one shared source of truth. And when you empower all areas of your organization with the technology to put empathy front and center, it becomes easy to solve all types of issues your customers experience and to keep your company&amp;#x27;s empathy tank on &amp;quot;Full.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Investing in Empathy Always Yields Happy Returns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Too often as digital product managers, developers, designers, and marketers, we forget the people we&amp;#x27;re creating for. We forget that our primary responsibility is making customers happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And if you want happy customers, you have to build the kinds of products and digital experiences that delightfully solve their problems. That&amp;#x27;s where empathy delivers in spades—and acts as a competitive advantage that will drive the future growth of your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you feel that—that is, the potential of empathy—and want to learn more about how software can turn on that power for your organization, we&amp;#x27;re here to help. We&amp;#x27;d love to know more about the digital experience problems you face and help you solve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You talk. We&amp;#x27;re here to listen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Graph active user trends by Segment and Search]]></title><description><![CDATA[Graph active user analytics—Monthy, Weekly, and Daily Active Users—for any Segment or Search in FullStory across whatever time required. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/graph-monthly-weekly-and-daily-active-user-trends-by-behavior-user-attribute</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/graph-monthly-weekly-and-daily-active-user-trends-by-behavior-user-attribute</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The FullStory Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2018 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get active user analytics plotted over time by whatever criteria you are tracking in FullStory.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Line graphs are an excellent way to visualize data so that it&amp;#x27;s easy-to-understand. &lt;b&gt;Trendlines&lt;/b&gt;—defined as line graphs that plot data over time—naturally highlight unexpected anomalies in your data, helping you focus research and analysis where it&amp;#x27;s most needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Perhaps best of all, simple line graphs don&amp;#x27;t require an analyst to translate them into meaningful, actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;See Your User Trends in FullStory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since line graphs are so helpful, FullStory now has a &lt;i&gt;User Trends&lt;/i&gt; visualization available for any search you run or segment you save&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/graph-monthly-weekly-and-daily-active-user-trends-by-behavior-user-attribute/#fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just pull up FullStory and beneath any list of sessions, look for the following card, which defaults to showing daily (active) users:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With &lt;b&gt;User Trends&lt;/b&gt; you can graph daily, weekly, or monthly data—whatever way happens to meet your team&amp;#x27;s needs. You can mouse over the lines in the &lt;i&gt;User Trends&lt;/i&gt; visualization and see how many users matched your search (or segment) on each day within your specified time range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Alternatively, you can see how the current period compares to the prior period. To toggle that line, look for the button in the dropdown menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get Advanced With Active User Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As cool as User Trends is, it&amp;#x27;s more exciting because it unlocks the ability to run active user analysis comparing daily, weekly, and monthly active user numbers. What is active user analysis? It&amp;#x27;s about product stickiness, and to understand that, a quick definitional detour is in order. Let&amp;#x27;s look at what daily, weekly, and monthly active users represent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Are Daily Active Users (DAU)?&lt;/b&gt;
Daily active users or &amp;quot;DAU&amp;quot; is the total number of users who meet a set of criteria (a.k.a. logged in, did X, clicked this, etc.) &lt;i&gt;by day&lt;/i&gt; over a given period. Pretty self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Are Weekly Active Users (WAU)?&lt;/b&gt;
Weekly active users or &amp;quot;WAU&amp;quot; is the total number of users who meet a set of criteria for at least one day over the past &lt;i&gt;week&lt;/i&gt;. If they met your criteria more than once, they only get counted a single time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Are Monthly Active Users (MAU)?&lt;/b&gt;
Monthly active users or &amp;quot;MAU&amp;quot; is the total number of users who meet met your criteria over the past month—&lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt; like weekly, each user is only counted a single time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;DAU, WAU, and MAU Help You Analyze Engagement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How often are your users returning to use your site or app?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;ve built a sticky product, you&amp;#x27;ll want to see your daily active users not only go up over time, but grow &lt;i&gt;closer to the weekly and monthly active users trendlines&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Said differently, in the most sticky product scenario, the ratio of DAU/WAU would approach 1. Or whatever ratio represents the number of days in a week you&amp;#x27;d ideally want your users to engage in whatever you&amp;#x27;re searching or segmenting on in FullStory. Want users to be in your app every workday in the week? Shoot for a DAU/WAU or DAU/MAU ratio of 5/7 or (0.714...).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A DAU to WAU (or MAU) ratio of 0.5 or less means that your users are visiting your site about 15 out 30 days (for Monthly) or 3.5 out 7 days for weekly. Tracking these active user ratios is a critical way to understand engagement overtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get Hip to the Trends in Your Data!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You don&amp;#x27;t have to calculate active user ratios to get value out of the User Trends graph. The best thing to do is simply take it for a spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next time you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/login&quot;&gt;log in to FullStory&lt;/a&gt;, pull up your favorite segment—or run a search on-the-fly. Scroll down &lt;i&gt;below your list of user sessions&lt;/i&gt; and take User Trends for a spin. Things you might explore:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How&amp;#x27;s your favorite funnel performing? &lt;/b&gt;Create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-fullstory-on-funnels/&quot;&gt;funnel in FullStory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/the-fullstory-on-funnels/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Do you observe regular trends in your user basis? How&amp;#x27;s the aggregated, weekly and monthly line look by comparison?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about your frustrated users? &lt;/b&gt;Any emerging trend or anomalous spikes worth investigating? Check out your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/guide-to-understanding-frustrating-user-experiences-online/#rage-clicks&quot;&gt;Rage Click&lt;/a&gt; sessions, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is that new feature being adopted? &lt;/b&gt;Create a search for users who engaged with your recently launched new feature. Is engagement rising? Falling? Completely absent? What&amp;#x27;s the DAU/MAU? If engagement isn&amp;#x27;t what you want it to be, consider re-evaluating how &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/marketing-and-the-jobs-to-be-done-framework/&quot;&gt;the feature&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;Job to Be Done&amp;quot; was marketed to users.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The possibilities are endless. And once you zero in on a problem, you know what to do next—take your quantitative analysis to the mat with qualitative research.

Cyber Monday. Cyber &lt;i&gt;Tuesday&lt;/i&gt;. Cyber &lt;i&gt;Week&lt;/i&gt;. Free Shipping Day. Prime Day. Singles&amp;#x27; Day. National Nachos Day ... Or your Product Hunt Launch Day!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you&amp;#x27;re gearing up for the next major shopping holiday or preparing for your next product launch, anticipating a rush of traffic to your site can be fun and scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You&amp;#x27;ve already done all the right things to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/5-customer-experience-optimizations-black-friday-cyber-monday-sales/&quot;&gt;optimize for your ideal customer experience&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe you&amp;#x27;re sitting in a code freeze or waiting for the right moment to start executing your launch plan. But, have you thought about how you&amp;#x27;re going to spend your workday during the joyful-hecticness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We have 6 recommendations to help get your team ready ahead of time. Being prepared can make all the difference between frantic scrambling or stepping into the Zen of your ideal workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s dive in to how you can ready your FullStory account ahead of your next high-volume event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Check Your Recording Session Quota&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first step to guaranteeing a scramble-free day of FullStory fun: make sure your session recording quota is large enough to accommodate your holiday traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ever feel like you&amp;#x27;ve got more relatives than guest rooms during the holidays? Unlike your home (which I&amp;#x27;m guessing has a finite amount of space), FullStory is designed to handle an extremely high volume of visitors. You can make room to comfortably capture every session, so no one gets left out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But—and this part&amp;#x27;s important—FullStory won&amp;#x27;t automatically record more than you purchased. Nobody likes a surprise overage fee. So if your account is currently setup to record a slow month’s traffic, you’ll want to raise your limits now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Take a look at your plan under &lt;b&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Subscription&lt;/b&gt; to see how many sessions you have left for the month, and if that doesn’t look like enough, feel free to edit your plan. If you have any questions about estimating the right quota for your holidays or launch, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/requests/new&quot;&gt;email a Hugger&lt;/a&gt;. Our Huggers can help connect you to the right place so you don&amp;#x27;t miss a beat during your mission-critical business days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Take a look at your plan under &lt;b&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Subscription&lt;/b&gt; to see how many sessions you have left for the month. If you need more sessions or if you have any questions about estimating the right quota for your holidays or launch, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/requests/new&quot;&gt;contact FullStory for help&lt;/a&gt; adjusting your limits. Between our helpful Huggers and the expert accounts team at FullStory, we can help adjust your headroom so you don&amp;#x27;t miss a beat during your mission-critical business days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Invite Your Co-workers and Enable Guest Seats for Your Domains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Great customer service is about empowering the people who work closest to your customers, and everybody benefits when there&amp;#x27;s a single digital source of truth for your customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Granting someone FullStory access is basically like gifting them with superpowers, and it&amp;#x27;s especially powerful for anyone who will be working an online help desk, debugging errors, or corresponding with customers on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get your whole team in on the fun!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ahead of a big event like Cyber Monday, take a minute to make sure everyone on your team has the access they need to see sessions and segments in FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623554&quot;&gt;standard seat&lt;/a&gt; works best for anyone who will want to use search, view trends, or triage technical problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624294&quot;&gt;guest seat&lt;/a&gt; works great for partners who need to see individual session replays but don&amp;#x27;t need to (or shouldn’t have) access to the rest of the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Navigate to &lt;b&gt;Settings &amp;gt; Team Settings&lt;/b&gt; and start giving out wings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Create Saved Segments for Key Pages and Conversion Funnels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What&amp;#x27;s the one thing you want to see most during your big day? Hits to your homepage? People coming through a promo and completing a checkout? What about subscriptions to your service?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whatever that thing is, you know (or at least have a very good guess) which audiences and user flows will matter most to follow in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you know the URL that will be live or the text on the button you&amp;#x27;ll want to watch, you can go ahead and build your FullStory &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020829633#Segment&quot;&gt;segments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020827453&quot;&gt;funnels&lt;/a&gt; ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That way, when you&amp;#x27;re ready to rock and roll, you&amp;#x27;ll already have the most important customer sessions and conversion rates front-and-center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And because FullStory stores and organizes all your digital experience data and makes it accessible via retroactive OmniSearch, you can build new segments on the fly for any user flows or questions that come up. That means no last-minute panic over forgetting to tag and track an element before the deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Not sure what segments to build first?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Start with the basics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visitors in your most important &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Error clicks on any key pages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile customers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Want even more robust analysis abilities for your most important funnels? &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/conversions-by-fullstory/&quot;&gt;Conversions by FullStory&lt;/a&gt; can show you the top opportunities to improve conversion rates for any funnel. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/conversions/?utm_source=how-to-set-up-fullstory-before-your-next-big-sale-or-event&quot;&gt;Learn more about Conversions&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/pricing/demo/?utm_source=how-to-set-up-fullstory-before-your-next-big-sale-or-event&quot;&gt;get a demo&lt;/a&gt; to see it in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Practice Your &amp;quot;Report a Bug&amp;quot; Triage Workflow&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With more traffic on your site than usual, it&amp;#x27;s inevitable that something will break down. Whether it&amp;#x27;s a third-party script slowing things down, a weird edge-case rendering problem on a popular mobile device, or a broken button on your checkout page, the key is to prepare for the unknown and know exactly how you&amp;#x27;ll respond when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Luckily, FullStory makes it easy to keep your debugging process tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624534&quot;&gt;Report a bug&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; feature in FullStory, you can share sessions and important details for debugging with anyone on your team, which massively cuts down on the amount of time you&amp;#x27;d normally spend reproducing a problem someone reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When errors do happen, the FullStory Console captures them. You can even use &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828313-Guide-to-Dev-Tools&quot;&gt;Dev Tools&lt;/a&gt; to inspect the Network activity and request-level details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s what to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have FullStory integrated with your other key apps like Slack or JIRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check that you&amp;#x27;ve got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/features/dev-tools/&quot;&gt;FullStory Dev Tools&lt;/a&gt; running (you can start a 14-day trial from the app!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch a session and use the &amp;quot;Share &amp;amp; Note&amp;quot; feature to create a Note. Click &amp;quot;Report a bug&amp;quot; on your Note to practice sending that Note into your system for triage. (You can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/quickly-and-easily-extract-debugging-info-from-fullstory/&quot;&gt;copy/paste session metadata&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work with your team to confirm that they received the FullStory sessions and debugging details and that they&amp;#x27;re able to see exactly what you reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How fast can you go from catching a bug to releasing a hotfix?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Test it out and get a sense for how quickly you&amp;#x27;ll be able to turn around issues when they&amp;#x27;re reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Practice Your &amp;quot;Find a Session for a Specific Customer&amp;quot; Workflow&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Frustrated Customer:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s broken.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Support:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;What&amp;#x27;s broken?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Frustrated Customer:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;The button.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Support:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Which button?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;

Many of our customers are self-supporters who like to use the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;knowledge base&lt;/a&gt; to solve problems on their own. And it’s my job to support these customers, too, in their quest to support themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Self-service help is, of course, very &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/more-than-human-but-not-machine/&quot;&gt;bionic&lt;/a&gt;. It reduces the time we need to spend on support, allows us to provide human, personable service through the way we write our help articles, and leaves our customers with a dopamine-induced feeling of pride in their self-reliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But giving every single customer a dopamine high, rather than an adrenaline-laced fit of rage, takes some work. Fortunately, it doesn’t have to be guesswork: with FullStory, customers show me exactly how to tweak the system to suit their needs. Without further ado, here are the top 4 pieces of advice I’ve discovered in my endeavors so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Customers will show you new articles to write.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customers express their intent through the search field, so keep an eye on what they’re typing into it. Some knowledge base applications keep a running list of these queries, but for less comprehensive setups you can easily use FullStory’s &lt;code&gt;Changed &amp;gt; CSS selector&lt;/code&gt; search instead. (For the CSS-disinclined, try our new Inspect mode to grab the right search field.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For some failed searches, the solution is to create a new article that answers their question. For example, a popular term on our help site is “wordpress.” There are no special installation instructions for Wordpress-based sites, so until recently we didn’t have a setup guide specifically for our Wordpress customers. However, it was clear that they had some concerns about compatibility and installation, so we created a guide to assuage their skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What I learned.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I save a lot of time, and make more customers happier, by writing articles customers “ask for” via searching instead of guessing at relevant topics. (Sorry, wiseguy, we won’t be addressing your question about what lurks beneath Donald Trump’s combover.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Consider what the customer has already read.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;They’re not just randomly knocking at your door. Because we’re talking about self-supporters in this article, chances are high that writing an email was their method of last resort, only after they had looked around in-app, scrutinized the knowledge base, and come up empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once, a customer wrote in with a question about performance. The reflexive response in this case is to point the customer in the direction of our help article on how FullStory affects your site’s performance. However, if the team member on support that day had watched the FullStory session, they’d have known that the customer had not only seen that article already, but he was on that page when he emailed support. Sending him back to the page he was already on could have been nothing if not frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What I learned.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When a customer writes in, check the FullStory session to see which help topics they’ve read. If they found the correct topic and are still writing in to support, the article could probably use some improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Search queries illuminate important keywords.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For some failed searches, the solution is not so cut-and-dried as writing a new article to match the query. Many people, for example, search for “user.” This could mean a thousand things when it comes to FullStory. User-scoped session searches? User cards? Custom user variables? User accounts? Solving the mystery required a little trip down FullStory lane to see which articles our customers wound up reading before they found their answers (or didn’t).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When I noticed that customers who searched for “user” ultimately ended up at one of approximately three or four topics, I added “user” as a keyword to these articles so they would appear top-of-list in future searches for “user.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What I learned.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After gleaning the customer’s search intent by watching FullStory sessions, adding keywords to relevant articles helps them appear higher in search results so future searchers don’t have to hunt around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hopefully my advice will help you tweak your knowledge base to better support your self-supporting customers. Not only will you save time fielding emails, but much more importantly your self-reliant customers will be happier with your product and your company. Wins for everyone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For more ideas around knowledge base optimization, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hubspot.com/knowledge-base&quot;&gt;Hubspot&amp;#x27;s Knowledge Base Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;* &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update, April 2020&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; — Since this post was published, roles have specialized as we&amp;#x27;ve grown and we no longer use the term “Hugger” in titles and departments. Although we knew the day would come, we also knew that an imagined future state wasn’t a good reason not to try something new in early days. We still believe every word we’ve written about Hugging.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;In fact, our Hugging philosophy has paid dividends over the years and continues to evoke a certain culture at FullStory. We grew our product and our brand around the beliefs that empathy wins the day, product led companies need a very close connection with their customers, and customer facing success and support roles should be highly empowered and garner great respect and influence internally. Check, check, check. And so, we lovingly lay our Hugging title to rest and thank it for it’s impact on our approach to work and business.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reducing rage: 3 ways FullStory rage clicks help improve frustrating UX]]></title><description><![CDATA[We created a way to monitor and search for Rage Clicks to answer the perennial question, “How do I know which sessions to watch?”]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/reducing-rage-3-ways-fullstorys-rage-clicks-help-improve-frustrating-ux</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/reducing-rage-3-ways-fullstorys-rage-clicks-help-improve-frustrating-ux</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Caitlin Brett]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2015 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;READ ME 👇 2017 update.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s been two years since FullStory pioneered Rage Clicks, and a lot has happened in the world of frustration metrics. If you want to learn about Rage Clicks, start with these posts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;What drives Rage Clicks?&lt;/a&gt; — Go here for an overview of Rage Clicks with lots of great examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/list-your-top-rage-clicks-and-dead-clicks/&quot;&gt;List your Top Rage Clicked elements&lt;/a&gt; — Want to find your most Rage Clicked elements on your website? It&amp;#x27;s easy with these reports in FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back to the original post from 2015 ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks are series of clicks in which your users are pummeling their mouse buttons in frustration. It’s like punching your website in the face—the digital equivalent of physical abuse—usually because it’s not doing what the user wants or expects it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We created a way to monitor and search for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-rage-clicks-error-clicks-dead-clicks/&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks (and its cousins, Dead Clicks and Error Clicks)&lt;/a&gt; to answer the perennial question, “How do I know which sessions to watch?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory inches ever closer to showing you not only the answers to your questions, but also to the questions you &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; be asking (but maybe haven’t thought of yet). It’s in that spirit that we developed a search for Rage Clicks. They bring up a very important question about your UI and answer it in the same breath: what parts of your UI are frustrating users, and why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Is your UI misleading your customers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When I say misleading, I mean that your customer anticipates a result when they click on a certain element, but nothing happens, or something happens that’s unexpected or unwelcome. Rage Clicks can help surface UI confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks helped us identify a major issue where an element wasn’t reacting as expected, and the experience was enraging our users so much that they were burying that element in a barrage of mouse clicks. Behold: Rage Against the User.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We created this segment and saved it as &lt;code&gt;Rage Against the User&lt;/code&gt; because our customers were, quite literally, Rage Clicking on a user’s email address or display icon in the playback sidebar. Customers expected the user’s name to be a link to their detailed profile, but lo and behold, it wasn’t. We’d never included that functionality. Not until a few days ago, when we finally added the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-are-desire-paths-and-how-use-desire-paths-for-design-and-development/&quot;&gt;link our customers desired&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for showing us the light, Rage Clicks!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Is your UI just too clicky?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, not all Rage Clicks are caused by the type of UX oversight I described above. Some Rage Clicks are the result of what you might consider normal app usage, like clicking repeatedly on a &lt;i&gt;next page&lt;/i&gt; button. But is a super-clicky button not a problem with your interface, as well?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In our case, it certainly was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Where are your customers looking?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s a lot to read about “mouse tracking” on the world wide web. Some mouse tracking apps claim that mouse movements have as high as an 88% correlation to eye movement, giving you a cheaper and more passive method than eye-tracking to measure where a visitor is looking on your page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Research isn’t conclusive on this subject, so I’m not going to stand here and tell you that your customer’s cursor shows exactly where they’re looking. But one of the most rigorous of these studies does show that there is a cohort of users who read with their mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One funny thing we noticed while watching Rage Click sessions is that a lot of these mouse-readers are clicking rapidly while they’re reading. We’re not quite sure why some people feel compelled to do this. (Personally, I think it’s cute!) But we’re grateful that they do, because it gives us a beautiful way to watch how our users’ eyes are flowing through the elements on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ready to research the rage?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For instant gratification, we’ve given all FullStory customers a default segment called “Rage clicked recently,” found in the left-hand sidebar of your dashboard. This segment shows all users from the preceding week who Rage Clicked on any part of your site, and it’s where most of the above examples were surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you get an idea of where Rage Clicks are occurring on your site, you can scope the search to a particular CSS selector, giving you Rage Clicks on only one element or family of elements. For example, here’s how we built the segment Rage Against the User:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Are you searching on Rage Clicks already? What nuggets of insight have you surfaced? We’re all ears on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/fullstory&quot;&gt;@fullstory&lt;/a&gt;, or you can reach out to the team via &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hugs@fullstory.com&quot;&gt;hugs@fullstory.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[With Segment install FullStory with the flip of a switch]]></title><description><![CDATA[The FullStory + Segment integration makes it easier than ever to learn about your users and improve their experience. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/with-segment-install-fullstory-with-the-flip-of-a-switch</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/with-segment-install-fullstory-with-the-flip-of-a-switch</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Scott Voigt]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we value providing you information about your users as quickly and easily as possible. Today, we are making it even easier to start learning about your users by partnering with Segment. As a Segment customer, you simply need to click a button to go live with FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re not a current Segment customer, you may be wondering what they do. &lt;a href=&quot;https://segment.com/&quot;&gt;Segment&lt;/a&gt; is a customer data hub. That means they collect the interaction data from your site, mobile app, smartwatch app, whatever, then transform and send it along to awesome services you use automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You just install Segment once, send them necessary customer data events like “Signed Up” and “Completed Order,” then flip a switch to integrate new tools. Then, to integrate FullStory, all you have to do is toggle us “on” in the Segment control panel, include your credentials, and hit “save.” Segment will make sure we get your data in the right format, so you can start using it to gain effective insight into your customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory gathers information on everything a user does in your website or web app. And yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/using/does-fullstory-work-with-my-complex-site&quot;&gt;we mean everything&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so creates a rich set of information about your customers and what they do. We know that this data can also be enriched with context. Knowing if a user is highly engaged with new features or how much revenue they have helped generate creates a powerful integrated story. You can use such a system to determine support priorities, effectively build new features, and learn how high-value potential customers experience your product. It’s better than building a custom tool that digs through event logs, your CRM, and your accounting system, trust us &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customers/&quot;&gt;trust these guys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Segment makes that type of integration painless.

While we do a lot already (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#what-happens-in-the-dom&quot;&gt;capturing the entire DOM automatically&lt;/a&gt; and making it all &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;searchable&lt;/a&gt;), there’s much more that&amp;#x27;s possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To that end, if you&amp;#x27;re a power user, you might be interested in hearing how to extend the power of FullStory with some tweaks to your code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Which of my users saw a specific error during their session?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you want to extend &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/proactive-support/&quot;&gt;proactive support&lt;/a&gt; for your customers or are striving to understand exactly how pervasive a painful experience is, being able to search for when a certain element (in this case a specific error) occurs is a necessary first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The way FullStory currently works, an element isn’t indexed simply by being visible on screen. Because it’s not indexed, it’s not searchable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s the thing: we can work around this limitation by &lt;i&gt;faking a click&lt;/i&gt; whenever a specific element appears. Since clicks are indexed by FullStory, these previously elusive error messages are suddenly searchable. 🙌&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s how you set it up.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you want to start capturing when your customers &amp;#x27;saw&amp;#x27; a specific error through faking a click, you need one of your front-end engineers to tweak the code on your site or app:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the front end code, find the place where you handle the error and display a message to your end user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change the code so that when you display the error message, you trigger a click event on that error message element.*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give the error message element an easy-to-search-for CSS class (e.g. div.someErrorMessage)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once this is done we can search in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt; for “clicks” on the CSS selector div.someErrorMessage and find all the sessions where our customers saw an error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hello proactive support!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that we’re armed with awareness, we can proactively find and fix errors that customers are finding irritating—just not irritating enough to go through the hassle of reporting them. We can then proactively follow-up with affected customers to let them know we’re on top of improving their experience!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The sky’s the limit.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Surfacing error message visibility is but one application of this trick. How might you use this tip to unlock even more value from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;FullStory&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;* One way to call up a click would be to use this code: &lt;u&gt;&amp;#x27;document.getElementById(&amp;#x27;myErrorMessage&amp;#x27;).click()&amp;#x27;&lt;/u&gt; Where the &lt;u&gt;myErrorMessage&lt;/u&gt; part is whatever css id you put on your error message — what that’s saying is, get the error message in the view, and make the browser artificially click on it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/track-when-elements-are-visible-on-screen-aka-has-seen/#fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How we helped AWeber tap Into the mind of the mobile user]]></title><description><![CDATA[See how FullStory provides quantitative and qualitative data to improve your conversion metrics.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/aweber-uses-session-replay-and-click-maps-to-improve-online-experience/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/aweber-uses-session-replay-and-click-maps-to-improve-online-experience/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin Owings]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Founded in 1998, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aweber.com/&quot;&gt;AWeber&lt;/a&gt; is an email marketing platform that helps 100,000+ small businesses, email marketers, and entrepreneurs create and send emails to their customers and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We had a conversation with Joe Cotellese, Director of Product at AWeber, to talk about how he first found FullStory three years ago (AWeber is one of FullStory’s oldest customers). Reflecting on that first experience, Joe shared how he was “blown away” when he saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay&quot;&gt;FullStory’s session replay technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the time, AWeber wanted a way to “see how our customers interact with a product without feeling like we were looking over their shoulder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Joe shared:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When you do usability studies, you’re putting customers in a sort of fake environment&lt;/b&gt; and asking them to do things in a more scripted way. Even saying, “Don’t worry about us, we’re just watching what you’re doing,” taints the study, so it’s hard to get a good idea of how customers really experience the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Having found FullStory, Joe knew session replay was the efficient, scalable solution they needed to understand their customer’s online experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From cold analytics to warm user empathy.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Like many other FullStory users, AWeber uses other analytics tools to pull together high-level, aggregated metrics to measure customer behaviors online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“We have a suite of tools we use for analytics,” Joe shares, “but you can only take those hard numbers so far. With FullStory, we were no longer looking at that data in a vacuum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As part of the product decision-making workflow, Joe’s team first selects a cohort of users to observe. Using KISSmetrics, the team tracks the most common actions taken within AWeber by the cohort. From there, the team turns to FullStory to view users’ actual in-app behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We use the quantitative data to understand things at the macro level,” said Joe, “and then use FullStory to see things at the micro level that we’d otherwise miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, Joe’s team recently noticed (via Google Analytics) that on mobile devices, many users were signing into their accounts from a browser window instead of using AWeber’s native mobile app. So they defined a segment of customers using the website on a mobile device, then identified in Google Analytics which website pages were most popular on mobile. From there, they used FullStory to watch &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; customers used those pages from their mobile devices. Joe shares their a-ha moment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we realized was that they were using some of the functions on those pages that our mobile app didn’t offer yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because session replay on FullStory provided a clear picture of what functionality customers &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; needed, Joe’s team was confident making specific changes to the AWeber online experience. The result was a more valuable app and increased usage of the native app over the web page on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Understanding aggregated behavior using FullStory Click Maps.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A key piece of AWeber’s decision-making workflow is &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/introducing-page-insights-with-click-maps-and-inspect-mode/&quot;&gt;FullStory’s Page Insights&lt;/a&gt;, which Joe describes as “better than heatmaps.” (You can find our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-are-web-heatmaps-how-do-they-work-pros-cons-alternatives/&quot;&gt;discussion on web heat maps here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s valuable to be able to look at individual sessions [in FullStory], but with Page Insights (Click Maps), we can stack those sessions on top of each other like onion paper, so you can see the aggregate behavior. The combination of those two views in one tool makes it really powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using Page Insights, Joe’s team recently identified a broken link on the AWeber user control panel — the main page users reach after signing into their accounts. Joe shares:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were watching the sessions thinking, ‘Why are they clicking there?’ Then we realized, ‘Oh, they’re clicking on that thing that doesn’t work, and expecting it to do something.’ We never would have caught that just with analytics — seeing the repeated pattern in the aggregated view was really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory helps AWeber understand their customers.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With FullStory, Joe’s team can collect deep user insights that normally require the work of a dedicated research team — for a fraction of the cost and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have the luxury of a giant research staff ... FullStory allowed us to take what would have been a painful process of scheduling user interviews and observing people in a controlled environment, and turn that into something we can do on a whim. It bridges the empathy gap much more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The added level of empathy that session replay provides helps Joe’s team at AWeber avoid making product decisions in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the alternative of &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; doing research during product development? You make bad guesses, and bad guesses cost money. Anything you can do to base your decisions on what customers are actually &lt;i&gt;doing&lt;/i&gt; will ensure you continue to grow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’re happy to have been supporting AWeber’s efforts to improve the customer experience these last three years.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Customer frustration explained: see your top rage and dead clicks]]></title><description><![CDATA[Know at a glance the top places customers get frustrated on your web site or app with FullStory’s Top Rage clicks and Dead clicks.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/list-your-top-rage-clicks-and-dead-clicks/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/list-your-top-rage-clicks-and-dead-clicks/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin Owings]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2017 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The power of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt; is that you can see through the eyes of your users and understand what they experienced on your web site or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What drove them to convert?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What frustrated them enough to bounce?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where do they get stuck, hitting a virtual dead end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’ve ever watched a frustrated user’s session recording, you’ve likely experienced the empathetic response that is unique to session replay.

We call them “Searchies” because each visualization is sensitive to the search or segment you’re currently viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you’re looking at “Everyone” in FullStory, the Searchies will show data for all your users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Top Rage Clicks and Top Dead Clicks Searchies.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This week, we released two new Searchies that will &lt;b&gt;help you triage Rage Click and Dead Click sessions.&lt;/b&gt; Simply &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/login&quot;&gt;login to FullStory&lt;/a&gt;, scroll down, and find a rank-ordered list of elements that cause Rage Clicks or Dead Clicks in your app. (Top Error Clicks are there, too — &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/web-analytics-for-most-error-clicked-elements/&quot;&gt;this Searchie was released&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks back.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Go ahead and click on the &lt;b&gt;Top Rage Clicks&lt;/b&gt; card.

We talked to CEO Chris Cummings to learn more about how SpanishDict uses FullStory to improve the user experience when it comes to translation on their web app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to craft a UX worth returning for.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you find yourself struggling with a website right out of the gate — clicking on the wrong buttons, trying to navigate to a page you can’t find, feeling frustrated when your &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/list-your-top-rage-clicks-and-dead-clicks/&quot;&gt;rage clicks&lt;/a&gt; don’t take you anywhere — your relationship with that website is usually burned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It may be hard to accept, but there are people out there having exactly those kinds of experiences with your site, right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Frustrating experiences prevent users from seeing a product’s potential value but can be avoided by remembering that users came to your site to get a job done. The easier and more delightful it is for them to accomplish what they came to do, the more likely they are to return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The first step in improving user experience is to discover what problems users run into that prevent them from accomplishing their goal. When SpanishDict dug into their user’s journey with FullStory, they were able to identify the following problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users were clearly telegraphing their need for a &lt;b&gt;feature that wasn’t provided&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users were &lt;b&gt;having trouble getting started &lt;/b&gt;using the product upon their first visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users were having trouble &lt;b&gt;seeing the full, existing functionality of the product&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s take a closer look at each of these problems, and how SpanishDict used FullStory to understand each one in order to improve the online experience for their users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What features are users showing you they want?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Creating a great user experience means providing users with everything they need in their journey. Sometimes, your customer will &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/what-are-desire-paths-and-how-use-desire-paths-for-design-and-development/&quot;&gt;show you something you hadn’t thought of&lt;/a&gt; on your own. And if you’re paying attention, you can learn from what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The team at SpanishDict knew that many users were turning to the website to learn how to conjugate verbs. The site made it easy for users to learn these conjugations: all a user had to do was type a verb into the website’s search bar, and they’d receive several tables of conjugated verbs for each verb tense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To better understand how users interacted with the conjugation tool, SpanishDict used FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.fullstory.com/how-to-use-click-maps-for-analysis-of-user-interactions-on-your-web-app/&quot;&gt;Page Insights Click Maps&lt;/a&gt; to understand where users were clicking most on the conjugation results page (Click Maps are a graphical overlay that enables you to see aggregated click insights on web page elements).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To the team’s surprise, they found &lt;b&gt;many people were clicking on the conjugated verbs even though they weren’t links&lt;/b&gt;. Users wanted more from the table of conjugations than what the page was giving them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;SpanishDict investigated further, speaking with users and soliciting customer feedback. They quickly learned that many users were trying to see the translation and pronunciation of each individual conjugation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watching user behavior combined with the feedback prompted the SpanishDict team to create a mouse-over translation feature to show users what each conjugated verb specifically means. They also added an audio feature for each conjugated verb so users could listen to the pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These changes allowed SpanishDict to help customers reach a larger goal. Users didn’t just want to know how to conjugate verbs. They also wanted the surrounding knowledge necessary to &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; these words. Adding these features drastically improved the experience of users trying to accomplish this goal — and &lt;b&gt;SpanishDict saw an increase in usage and retention from these users&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Find bugs that block users’ path to success.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The simplest issues in page layout or site navigation can obstruct your user’s path to accomplishing their goal. Removing these obstacles &lt;i&gt;gets your product out of the user’s way&lt;/i&gt;, yet until you experience the product from the user’s point of view, you may be blind to these roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;SpanishDict was able to remove one of these obstacles when they noticed something strange about new user behavior — particularly on their mobile site. People visiting the homepage would fail to interact with the search/translation bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The team investigated the problem with FullStory’s Session Replay. When they watched session recordings of first-time visitors to the homepage, they noticed that their banner ad for &lt;b&gt;their app was pushing the search bar down and off the page&lt;/b&gt;. It wasn’t clear to users how to begin — or what to do on the website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This was detrimental to the user experience. The search bar is the most prominent feature of the product, enabling the user to engage with SpanishDict right away and start translating words. It was even more essential for the search bar to be visible on the mobile site. A huge component of the site’s value is in giving users the opportunity to translate and conjugate words on the go, whenever they need them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once they saw this bug, they were able to fix it by moving the search bar up so that both the ad and the search bar were visible in the landscape view of the mobile site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As simple as the fix was, SpanishDict was only able to understand it through watching user sessions through FullStory. This simple fix lead to an immediate rise in user engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Make sure your site shows the product’s full functionality.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you’re always looking at your product from the development, marketing, or sales side, you know all of its best features like the back of your hand. But those features might not be so obvious to a user who hasn’t seen the product roadmap or sat in on marketing meetings. The product has to make its full functionality clear and discoverable to users who are completely unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One of the SpanishDict’s most helpful features is the ability to translate whole sentences in addition to one-off word lookups. For example, you can type an entire sentence and then translate it in one query:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unfortunately, SpanishDict discovered through session replay that mobile users were having a hard time using the search bar to translate longer sections of text. The team saw that &lt;b&gt;limitations on the size of the entry field made it hard to use for longer sentence inputs&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In other words, the box would remain the same size even if a user continued to type beyond the box’s visible capacity and the user would suddenly find themselves unable to see what they were writing. Users would quickly give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;SpanishDict took this newfound insight as an opportunity to innovate on the product and developed an auto-adjusting text box that would expand as necessary if a user types in a long query on Mobile:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The new, dynamic input makes it simple for users to input longer sentences for translation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By making this change to the text box on both the desktop and mobile sites, &lt;b&gt;SpanishDict saw an increase in users translating long sentences and paragraphs&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Understand the user’s perspective to improve the online experience.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using FullStory to dig into user experiences on their site, the SpanishDict team was able to identify the problems that prevented users from getting all of the information they need to feel comfortable navigating between Spanish and English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These problems only required small fixes to make a significant impact on the user’s understanding and use of the product, yet they would have remained unknown had SpanishDict not used FullStory to uncover them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Muchas gracias to Chris and SpanishDict for sharing your story!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Interested in hearing more ways &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/tag/use-cases/&quot;&gt;FullStory session replay and Click Maps&lt;/a&gt; are used to build better products?

This partnership means that almost any integrated functionality is at your fingertips, for example, FullStory + Redshift, FullStory + Amplitude, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Connecting FullStory + Marketo with Tray.io&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One such automation that Tray.io makes possible (and that we’re particularly excited about on the FullStory marketing team) is the FullStory to Marketo connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketo.com/&quot;&gt;Marketo&lt;/a&gt; is a sophisticated marketing automation software that makes it possible to plan more thoughtful, personalized marketing outreach to your audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory’s powerful analytics engine indexes and analyzes every customer interaction, proactively surfacing top opportunities to optimize digital experience, and enabling teams to understand issues, prioritize fixes, remediate bugs, and measure the impact of those changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And now, thanks to Tray.io, you can use the treasure trove of digital experience data from FullStory to trigger actions in Marketo. It’s easier than ever to create personalized Marketo campaigns that drive higher engagement and ultimately convert more leads to opportunities and closed-won deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How might you use this new power? Here are three essential customer-centric automations to build using FullStory, Tray.io, and Marketo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. If a user has more than 10 Rage Clicks in one day, add to a product education drip campaign and alert CSM to check in.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks&lt;/a&gt; are a helpful indicator of customer frustration in your app or on your website. The cause of that frustration could be anything from brokenness or confusion (and FullStory’s session replay will reveal the cause either way).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With Tray.io, you can easily funnel frustrated users identified in FullStory into an education drip campaign, providing helpful product guidance. You can simultaneously alert someone from customer success to do a quick check in—perhaps having them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/session-replay-customer-support/&quot;&gt;review the customer’s session&lt;/a&gt; and reach out with more specific assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. When a customer reaches a key product milestone, add them to a smart list for a drip campaign outlining the next steps in product education.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Often, product marketers use onboarding emails to communicate &lt;i&gt;all of the information&lt;/i&gt; a user might need within the first few days or weeks of creating an account or purchasing a product. In reality, every user will onboard at their own pace. Ensuring they get the right guidance at the right time can make a big difference in product adoption and customer success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, with Tray.io, it’s possible to ‘listen’ for FullStory to register that a user has hit a product milestone. When they do, you can quickly add them to a smart list in Marketo that triggers the next set of onboard email(s).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. When a customer doesn’t log in for some period of time, add them to a smart list for a re-engagement campaign and alert CSM.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’ve ever worked in customer success, you’ve likely experienced the following: You check in on a client or an account only to discover that they disengaged a few months before and your outreach is coming a bit too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With Tray.io and FullStory, you&amp;#x27;ll know exactly when signals of disengagement happen (e.g. the customer is not logging in as often). When you receive those signals, you can alert the CSM, while also adding the customer to a smart list in Marketo that sends a re-engagement campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;See Tray.io&amp;#x27;s FullStory connector in action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The possibilities for delivering exactly what prospects and customers need &lt;i&gt;when they need it&lt;/i&gt; are almost endless thanks to the power and flexibility of the Tray.io and FullStory platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re ready to see how you can supercharge digital experience with automation, join Tray.io’s live &lt;a href=&quot;https://tray.io/webinar/weekly-group-demo/register?utm_source=partner&amp;amp;utm_medium=fullstory&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fullstory-blog&amp;amp;utm_content=partner-announcement&quot;&gt;weekly group demo&lt;/a&gt; and see the Tray + FullStory integration in action.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[3 steps to build bionics at your company]]></title><description><![CDATA[What's bionics at FullStory?

And when I ask a candidate for their thoughts on the last one—Bionics—it&amp;#x27;s not uncommon for me to get a funny look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What the heck does bionic mean and why do we have it as a company value?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The simplest way to think about it is often the first pop-culture reference that you think of: &lt;i&gt;The Bionic Woman&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Six Million Dollar Man&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;Ironman&lt;/i&gt;. These familiar characters share something in common: they are humans made more powerful through machinery. Of note, it&amp;#x27;s the human element that&amp;#x27;s core to our choice to focus on the word “bionic” instead of “automated” or “robotic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It would help if the public conversation around robots and technology could be reframed as &lt;b&gt;human plus machine&lt;/b&gt; rather than &lt;b&gt;machine minus human&lt;/b&gt;. Because when we’re truly thinking of how we can apply technology to enhance our own human qualities, the end result is for humans to be made happier and more productive (rather than subservient to our robot overlords).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bionic is a mindset. When understood and properly wielded, striving to be bionic helps teams make better decisions and build better processes—the kind that result in higher quality outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3 Steps Toward Bionics at Your Company&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Identify the Friction in the Process&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First, understand there will always be bad processes in need of fixing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Despite our best intentions, poor systems emerge. Cumbersome bureaucracy happens—even to the best companies. The resulting friction can slow operations down and in the worst cases, grind progress to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Friction in the process can happen for several reasons, such as not solving for the right root cause, evolving needs that result from rapid growth, trying to accommodate too many asks in a single process, or by continuously bolting on solutions to an original process. The key to identifying brokenness in your bionics is that the machine is now opposing its intended function. And in the most egregious cases, the human-element is nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When friction happens—and it will—take on a bionic mindset. Be willing to experiment, iterate, and adapt. Don’t settle for the status quo. Always be scanning your ecosystem for signs of pain or friction that have appeared since you last checked in. And be self-critical—that amazing process you innovated last year may now be woefully out of date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you’ve identified friction, answer a simple question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Does a human add value to this process?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If the answer is “No,” you’re not looking for a bionic solution, you’re looking for an automated solution—and that is OK! Some things we have to do are just drudgery. Identify those things and do everything in your power to automate or eliminate that type of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And for that, you’ll want to read on for &lt;b&gt;Step 2&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If the answer is &amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot;—and a human does add value—then skip to &lt;b&gt;Step 3&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Audit Your Time, Automate What You Can&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adding machinery to our daily workflows should free up your time to do the meaty thought work humans do best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bionics need not be just about sweeping company-wide processes. Have you ever examined your calendar or used a time tracking tool to figure out exactly how you spend your energy most days? Sometimes it can be eye opening how much time you spend simply manipulating spreadsheets or providing answers to questions that could have been documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you haven’t done this recently, take a moment to audit how you’ve been spending your time. There should be at least a few things you hate doing (see step #1) and at least several things that you really love and look forward to doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here’s how you can get started. Take a sheet of paper. An index card will do. Throughout your day, write down the things you do. If you spend 15 minutes dealing with email, write it down. Is Slack consuming lots of time? Make a tick mark for every time you jump into Slack. Track the meetings you attend, making a note of every 30 minutes you spend in a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Audit your days over the course of a week. Where are you spending your time? Are there opportunities to cut out activities that rob you of time? E.g. is there a way to batch process Slack? Batch process email?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are simple things you can do to eek out efficiencies in your daily workflow. While it can be a pain to audit your time, if you can automate certain workflows or find ways to make the drudgery more efficient, it’s well worth it. Because the routine tasks you do every day—even if they only take a couple minutes here and a couple minutes there—add up to huge chunks of time over the weeks, months, and years of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you’re saving all that time spent on less meaningful tasks, you’ll want to turn back to leveraging bionics for your favorite, human value adding activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Start Bionicizing by Constructing Pits of Success&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I’m a big fan of process, but I sometimes get dirty looks when I say so. This is because people tend to equate the term process with red tape or friction (see list item #1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It doesn’t have to be that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the contrary, when you’re wearing your bionic hat, process can (and should!) be equated with a “pit of success” mentality wherein the process itself is seamless and invisible to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;“Pit of success? What’s that?” Some light Googling ties the origination of the term “pit of success” back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@ricomariani/the-pit-of-success-cfefc6cb64c8&quot;&gt;Rico Mariani&lt;/a&gt; from his memo about software development:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;— Rico Mariani, MS Research MindSwap, Oct. 2003&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rico’s idea was simple: build products so your end user—by doing what seems to be the simplest, most intuitive thing— always succeeds in their task.
Although this quote was meant to describe product design and development, it also applies to business operations. You can help employees at your company fall into a pit of success by constructing processes wherein the very act of trying to do the right thing actually results in &lt;i&gt;doing&lt;/i&gt; the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First, eliminate as much decision making and as many manual steps as possible. When paths diverge, humans are forced to make decisions which are cognitively expensive and prone to error. &amp;lt;Insert your own favorite &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incognito:_The_Secret_Lives_of_the_Brain&quot;&gt;research and psychology&lt;/a&gt; lessons about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow&quot;&gt;how the brain works&lt;/a&gt; here&amp;gt;. In short, our brains are constantly trying to run on autopilot and we’re often making split second decisions based on categorizations that may or may not apply to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here, the bionic approach is to eliminate ambiguity so that tasks can require less conscious thought. In other words, leverage pattern matching to create habits that are repeatable and predictable. Make it easy for employees to spot a common workflow and then anchor that pattern to a habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, at FullStory if you want to ask another department for help about a routine problem, you always do the same thing: you have a conversation with a slackbot (we call our bot “@conscious” in Slack). Our slackbot proceeds to run you through a decision tree of boilerplate questions. Based on your answers, a task is created and routed to the right folks in the other department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you’ve used our “conscious” bot a couple times for the same asks, you learn that the answer to “How do I get help from someone on another team?” always has the same answer: ask the bot, run through the workflow, and go on with your day. In other words, your brain pattern matches and gets to work on autopilot. Meanwhile, other departments—the ones who get asked the same questions over and over again—are saved from reading from a tired script to get routine answers … everyone lands in the pit of success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Be a Happy Human: Spend Your Time Doing the Things You’re Best At&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The goal of bionics is to optimize your human time, making sure machinery is both alleviating the rote drudgery and helping you to make decisions without consuming all of your available brain glucose. Use the time you save to apply your most human skills (e.g. empathy) to the tasks that make you want to come to work every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ultimately, being bionic is not about cutting-edge tools. It’s a process of rationalizing decisions with a view to reaching the most scalable solution possible—while still maintaining our humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[3 ways to boost conversion rates in complex funnels]]></title><description><![CDATA[Improving the digital customer experience at key micro-conversion moments leads to increased revenue, better retention, and improved customer loyalty.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/blog/3-ways-to-boost-conversions</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/blog/3-ways-to-boost-conversions</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Melanie Crissey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2020 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;See top opportunities to improve completion rates for any user flow.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In online marketing, a &lt;b&gt;conversion rate&lt;/b&gt; represents the proportion of people who experience a campaign and then take a desired action. For example, you might measure the conversion rate of people who view a display ad and then purchase a product (i.e. a &amp;quot;view-through conversion&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Marketers aren’t the only ones with conversion rates to report. If you look close enough, you&amp;#x27;ll find that conversions really are all around. For example, when you roll out a new product feature, you likely have some goal for engagement that requires a user or customer to complete one or more actions. This user flow—or journey—has a conversion rate that can be measured from step to step. You can think of each step in a multi-step process as a conversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every business-critical conversion is associated with a large number of these micro-conversion moments, and these moments lead up to an eventual transaction. Improving the digital experience—and your overall conversion rate—at these critical moments in the customer&amp;#x27;s journey can lead to increased revenue, better retention, and improved customer loyalty, overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Connecting the (Conversion) Dots&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Higher revenue, retention, and loyalty? Not so fast! In order to move the needle, you need to know the current conversion rate and what to optimize next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That’s where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/conversions/&quot;&gt;Conversions by FullStory&lt;/a&gt; comes in. If you&amp;#x27;re not familiar, Conversions is designed to help product teams:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measure conversion rates or completion rates for any multi-step user journey, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;See exactly which issues or experiences are causing drag and drop-off from step to step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this blog post, I’ll explore three ways you can optimize conversion paths that are more complex than your traditional &amp;quot;advertisement → add-to-cart&amp;quot; with the help of Conversions by FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Measure the Completion Rate of a Dynamic, Multi-Step Form&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example: A loan application or very complex survey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As digital becomes the new norm for customer-brand interactions, businesses and service providers are moving lengthy application processes from paper-and-clipboards to self-service online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Think about the new patient form you might complete before seeing a doctor for the first time, or the paperwork required for a home loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you move a critical form or survey online, it&amp;#x27;s usually not &amp;quot;set it and forget it.&amp;quot; Entire product teams may be assigned to manage the usability and ensure that users are able to successfully, safely, and accurately provide required information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using FullStory, your product team can quickly analyze user interactions with complex forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to get started in FullStory:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the Conversions tab and click &amp;quot;Select a Conversion Funnel&amp;quot; to reveal the &amp;quot;+ Create Conversion Funnel&amp;quot; option&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Name your Conversion Funnel something you&amp;#x27;ll remember, such as &amp;quot;Loan application form&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build your Conversion Funnel event by event; there should be one unique event filter for each key field or button you&amp;#x27;d like to measure along the way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &amp;quot;Save&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Notice that before you even hit &amp;quot;Save,&amp;quot; FullStory will show you the drop-off from step to step. Once you save this Conversion Funnel, FullStory will show you not only the completion rate for the form, but exactly which errors and issues impact drop-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; With a highly complex form, a user&amp;#x27;s sense of cognitive ease can diminish quickly. The mental effort required to complete a task becomes too high, and users switch to a state of cognitive strain. This can lead them to become more vigilant and suspicious, resulting in a decrease in confidence, trust, and pleasure. Next thing you know, they&amp;#x27;ve abandoned your form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Look for drop-offs related to user fatigue and think about whether that information could be collected later or whether you could use a method that requires less user engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Analyze Critical Onboarding Forms on Desktop and Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example: Sign up, create account flows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Every new, active user will log into their account for the first time, at some point in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether you manage a SaaS application or a customer portal for an e-commerce site, your customer&amp;#x27;s first experience logging in is more than a first impression—it sets the stage for future success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your customer&amp;#x27;s first experience logging in is more important than a first impression—it sets the stage for future success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is the first action a user wants to complete when they sign in as a customer? What other steps do they need to complete in order to achieve their first &amp;quot;magic moment?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use Conversions to understand the points of friction in this critical flow. Build your onboarding flow in Conversions, referencing individual URL paths, text from key links and buttons, or CSS selectors for each required step. For example, see the steps in this screenshot below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Save your Conversion Funnel and scroll down to see top opportunities to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you can see when you look under the &amp;quot;Lost Conversions&amp;quot; column, for this onboarding funnel, Conversions detected that a slow &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828873-Page-Speed-Metrics#fmp&quot;&gt;First Meaningful Paint&lt;/a&gt; time. The impact? 13 Lost Conversions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/news/press/2017-press/akamai-releases-spring-2017-state-of-online-retail-performance-report.jsp&quot;&gt;Akamai reports&lt;/a&gt; that a 100 millisecond delay in load time can cause conversion rates to drop by 7% and a 2-second delay can increase the bounce rate by 103%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because FullStory detects both page speed metrics and conversion rates, it can detect whether performance anomalies directly impact completion rates for key user flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Understand Interactions With Modals and Carousels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Example: A product carousel or in-app walkthrough tutorial modal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;I sometimes joke, &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;If you have a very important secret message that must be hidden from everyone and never seen, put it on the second page of a carousel.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot; (It’s quite possible that only I think this is funny.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In all seriousness, though, there are often situations where a carousel or walk-through modal is the best way to guide users through important steps while maximizing your digital real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re on a mission to prove that your carousel works (or to understand where it doesn&amp;#x27;t work!), you can use a Conversion Funnel to measure the number of customers who make it from view to view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Build your Conversion Funnel with the right CSS selectors to measure click by click:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can also easily track subsequent micro-conversions. For example, how many visitors click through on a product image or call-to-action after clicking to move the carousel forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To do this, simply add additional steps to your funnel until you&amp;#x27;re measuring the ideal &amp;quot;happy path&amp;quot; for visitors through a specific part of your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; With carousels and modals, you&amp;#x27;ll want to pay special attention to Dead Clicks. Dead Clicks can represent areas where users expected an interaction that didn&amp;#x27;t happen.

So you load up your web analytics and check your metrics.  Page duration has ticked up! ... But conversions have dropped. &lt;i&gt;What is going on?&lt;/i&gt; And how many experiments will it take to figure it out? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If only you had more precise, better, more complete data, then maybe you could find your answers ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a digital product manager, you constantly turn to data to help gauge product performance and identify areas for improvement. However, finding meaning in this steady stream of information—mining the insights that will truly pave the way for better digital experiences for your customers—is far easier said than done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What if the struggle lies not with our abilities to interpret traditional analytics, but with traditional analytics itself? What if these metrics, by virtue of their very nature as an abstraction of reality, are doomed to fail us? And if this is the case, where should we turn for guidance instead? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Keep your maps close by for this journey ... but maybe not as close as you&amp;#x27;d think. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Map Is Not the Territory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2015/11/map-and-territory/&quot;&gt;an excellent piece on the Farnam Street blog&lt;/a&gt;, Shane Parrish describes the concept of “the map is not the territory.” He summarizes the concept from a revolutionary 1931 presentation by mathematician &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski&quot;&gt;Alfred Korzybski&lt;/a&gt;, who introduced the idea while elaborating on the relationship of both language and mathematics to physical reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In Parrish’s words, “the description of the thing is not the thing itself.” This is true for both language and mathematics. The word &amp;quot;elephant,&amp;quot; of course, doesn&amp;#x27;t actually weigh three tons and have a trunk. (Did you have to read that twice?) The number “9” is an abstract concept and not a physical object. A painting of a pipe is not a pipe. And a map of your local city is not, in fact, the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Maps, models, descriptions, theories—and yes, quantitative analytics—fall into the category of abstractions as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re thinking, “We need abstraction to navigate through this complex world, don’t we? What’s the problem?” You&amp;#x27;re right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We need maps and models and all the rest. Only, problems arise when we fail to acknowledge their limitations or rely too heavily on them. We have to recognize the ways they can lead us astray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reality is Messy. Do You Have a &amp;quot;Ground Truth?&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do we ensure our various “maps” don&amp;#x27;t take us in the wrong direction? First, we have to remember that no maps or models are able to convey reality with 100% accuracy. “They are an abstraction, and abstraction means that information is lost to save space,” Parrish writes. “In our march to simplify reality with useful models, we confuse the models with reality. For many people, the model creates its own reality. It is as if the spreadsheet comes to life. We forget that reality is a lot messier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;In our march to simplify reality with useful models, we confuse the models with reality. For many people, the model creates its own reality. It is as if the spreadsheet comes to life. We forget that reality is a lot messier.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;— Shane Parrish&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The more time you spend working with abstractions to make sense of reality, the easier it is to fool yourself. Nassim Taleb, the author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680/&quot;&gt;Anti-Fragile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Fooled-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/0399590455/&quot;&gt;many other books on risk and complexity&lt;/a&gt;, is known for calling out how the theoretical is often confused for the actual, especially by those who work heavily with abstractions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;For real people, if something works in theory, but not in practice, it doesn&amp;#x27;t work.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;For academics, if something works in practice, but not in theory, it doesn&amp;#x27;t exist.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;— Nassim Taleb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Taleb takes issue with the ease with which we can allow theory to prevail over practice. This is backwards because what works in practice is what actually happens. It is &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_truth#Military_usage&quot;&gt;ground truth&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; and cannot be dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Maintaining a connection to what&amp;#x27;s concrete—the territory—prevents us from making critical errors of judgment due to an over-reliance on maps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So for digital products, how do we apply this concept?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get Started in the Right Direction... &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We need maps, but we have to remember not to mistake them for reality. So how do we use them wisely? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For teams tasked with improving product metrics, go ahead and start with a map. Load your product analytics dashboard. Study engagement metrics like session duration, bounce rates, and conversion rates. These measurements will alert you to problems and possible opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Just remember that no matter how effective your quantitative analytics may be at measuring &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; your product is performing, they aren&amp;#x27;t enough. You still need a way to answer the question of &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; it&amp;#x27;s performing that way. You need a way to pay attention to what&amp;#x27;s happening on the ground—a way to see the territory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;...Then Mind Your Surroundings by Observing the Territory &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For digital products, you need a way to see the raw digital experience and know the qualitative, individual experience of the end user. This is your territory. It is the data that supplies the story behind the numbers and brings the  metrics to life&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do you research and observe what your customers &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; experience when using your product? How do you measure and understand your customers’ needs and desires? We count three ways: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. As simple as it sounds, you can make a habit of talking and listening to your customers.
    a. Regularly read customer feedback.
    b. Answer a certain number of support tickets.
    c. Listen to friends and family who use your product.
    d. Eat your own dog food. (That is, use your own product!)
2. Observe customer behavior through traditional usability testing.
3. Finally, use a digital experience analytics platform—one with session replay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s this third method that will help you gain critical qualitative insights as quickly and efficiently as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Immerse Yourself in Ground Truth: Their Real Experience &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A digital experience analytics platform allows you to go from the map directly to the territory. For example, you can search for a specific issue with your digital customer experience—a software bug, a poorly performing landing page, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/how-fullstory-helped-autopilot-craft-a-better-onboarding-experience/&quot;&gt;a frustrating onboarding experience&lt;/a&gt;, and the list goes on and on—to watch the issue unfold from the perspective of users who encountered it. You see what happened and the actions they took—or attempted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, the digital agency Fullstack wanted to investigate the reasons that bounce rates for one of their client websites were so high. Google Analytics gave them the numbers but not the reasons &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;. The Fullstack team used these analytics to focus their attention. Then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstackdigital.com/how-to-increase-search-traffic-for-a-low-rated-website-in-2018-11b47a57ab59&quot;&gt;they turned to FullStory&lt;/a&gt; to &amp;quot;look at the territory&amp;quot; and replay  these underperforming user sessions. The Fullstack team watched as users scrolled through their client&amp;#x27;s content, paying special attention to where they lost interest. By seeing where the content failed to meet user expectations, Fullstack knew what to overhaul in order to improve bounce rates. Fullstack has also used this &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/from-0-12-percent-optimizing-conversions-with-session-replay/&quot;&gt;quant+qual workflow to optimize conversion rates&lt;/a&gt; for PPC campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Connecting quantitative insights (the map) to qualitative research (the territory) can bring traditional web analytics and other quantitative numbers to vivid life. It&amp;#x27;s a one-two punch that grounds abstractions and interpretations in a relatable source of truth—the real digital experiences of users. Instead of having to come up with best guesses to explain key metrics, you get to observe and learn from the actual, individual customer experiences that comprise them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to measuring digital customer experiences, this is as close to the territory as we can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Safe Travels and Many Happy Returns &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We appreciate a good map as much as anyone. Maps are incredibly helpful for providing that high-level view you need to prioritize and focus attention. The key insight here is that as helpful as maps can be at providing direction or in simplifying complex information, they are not enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And when it comes to the “maps” of traditional analytics, it’s important to remember that these abstractions don’t reflect the actual experiences of what your customers go through. Don’t blindly follow these maps right off a cliff! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Instead, remember to connect your quantitative data to your qualitative insights. Observe the territory of your customer experience through listening to customers, running usability tests, or activating a digital experience analytics platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Immerse yourself in the ground truth of the real customer experience and ensure the map is never mistaken for the territory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
