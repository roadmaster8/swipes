We survived a pandemic, government-mandated restrictions, worldwide lockdowns, and a sweeping crisis that triggered dramatic shifts in shopper behavior.  Many companies were wholly unprepared, while others were able to pivot quickly and deliver unexpected value to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Uncertainty is likely to be the status quo for the  foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
The ability to shift and continually deliver what customers want will be critical as businesses work to thrive in the new normal. This is where  experimentation-driven organizations will continue to lead the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
These organizations are focused on iteration. On testing and learning in a cycle of continuous improvement. This allows them to stay close to their customers and encourages organizational humility and flexibility. If an experience isn’t resonating with customers, the response is to quickly test and validate a new evidence-based idea and change that experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.ctfassets.net/4e8xy1krjypg/62roPfWCMYKktv8PhElhbd/faaef803e3c467d506700cd5ad15144f/FS_experimentation_strategies.pdf&quot;&gt;Download your copy of this guide for five actionable experimentation tactics for businesses of all sizes.&lt;/a&gt;

Customers will bounce or give up based on speed alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because perceived performance is critical to user experience, the last thing you need is a digital experience tool that weighs down your website or your app. That will only exacerbate the very problem you&amp;#x27;re trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Any third-party service you want to use to optimize your digital experience, from A/B testing to analytics, is going to have some impact on the total load time of your page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The key is setting a “performance budget”—an allowable tolerance of that impact—and ensuring the solutions you select fit within it. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your goal should be to reap the rewards of third-party platforms without &amp;quot;breaking the bank&amp;quot; or passing along the costs of poor performance to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Need to free up room in your performance budget? Start with the basics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimize image and media files&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minify JavaScript&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implement caching&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serve content from a CDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove scripts from third parties no longer in use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What to look for in implementation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For most digital experience solutions, the first step is to install a library of code, typically with a bit of JavaScript. This library enables the service to continuously log digital interactions via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Session Replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s what to look for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stability and uptime&lt;/b&gt;: Does your provider supply an SLA for uptime? Do they alert you proactively if analytics are interrupted?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Client-side processing&lt;/b&gt;: Is the script that initiates the service a static script that indexes everything? Or, does it do the heavy lifting, such as event naming or currency conversion, client-side? Does the script increase in size as you want to report new events or metrics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perceived performance&lt;/b&gt;: Does the script block page rendering? Does it interrupt interactivity with elements on the page?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence and performance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (DXI) solution is designed for speed and reliability from the ground up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623514-Installing-the-FullStory-Script&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;one single, tiny recording script&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (about 58.8 kB, gzipped), customers of FullStory gain access to 100% complete, instrumentation-free analytics, high-fidelity session replay for every session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because FullStory starts by capturing every digital interaction with the website or web app—with personal data either excluded or masked at the source in the browser or on the device—the size of the FullStory recording script always stays small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your team can build new segments, dashboards, or analytics views in FullStory without needing to further alter the script code. That means no manual instrumentation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What does this mean for your business? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Start small, stay small&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to DXI, the script won&amp;#x27;t &amp;quot;balloon&amp;quot; over time as your team analyzes additional data for future business use cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Compare this to other digital experience platforms which require ongoing instrumentation or additions to their recording scripts. With other solutions, every new data point you&amp;#x27;d like to analyze requires a manual update behind the scenes. This not only introduces the possibility of human error but increases the size of the file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In many cases, customers of legacy digital experience tools are unaware of the real size of their script, and that they slowly creep up over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Minimize the fetch&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Beyond simply being and staying small, FullStory&amp;#x27;s recording script is edge-cached on &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/cdn&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google’s Cloud CDN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. FullStory monitors and verifies the performance of the script with a third-party synthetic monitoring service that runs constant tests from more than 40 locations around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In our monitoring, we see that fully loaded times for the file are typically ~20 ms, with some variances depending on global regions. Conservatively, you should expect to see fully loaded times in the range of 50 ms to 150 ms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Get out of the way&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition to being small and loading quickly, the FullStory script also loads asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s how it works: a small stub script loads the main script (fs.js), but only after other required static resources such as CSS and images load first. &lt;b&gt;This means that FullStory will never visually block page rendering or interactivity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once loaded, the recording script is cached locally in the browser for 10 minutes. It won&amp;#x27;t load all over again as your visitors navigate from page to page. Every 10 minutes the browser will perform a one-time check to the CDN to look for the latest version. If a new version is available, the browser will download and cache the latest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While new updates only happen about once per week, any other requests would receive a response code “304 - Not modified” which takes less than 10 ms to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And, because the script loads asynchronously, it&amp;#x27;s near impossible for the FullStory script to impact the availability of your website or web app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the off-chance that the FullStory script ever becomes unavailable for any reason, it won&amp;#x27;t take your site or app down with it. FullStory loads asynchronously and will never visually block page rendering or interactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Optimize recording&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After the initial recording script loads, FullStory sits quietly in the background while your users interact with your website or web app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Without processing any complex logic or interfering with the page, it records every mutation in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;DOM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and bundles those changes in the memory on the browser. During periods of inactivity, the bundled events are compressed and flushed to FullStory servers—about every 5 seconds or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These bundles of events are assembled and sent to FullStory servers asynchronously to minimize execution on the main thread. FullStory&amp;#x27;s bundling processes are never allowed to delay dynamic page rendering or affect the interactivity of any elements on the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Understanding performance impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Verifying perceived performance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to measuring performance, the most important consideration is the perceived performance or impact on real visitors. For this reason, many web performance leaders have shifted focus from traditional page load times to metrics such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/first-contentful-paint/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;First Contentful Paint&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (FCP) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/fid/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;First Input Delay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (FID).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order to get a sense of perceived performance, we recommend you use a synthetic web performance monitoring solution, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.splunk.com/en_us/observability/synthetic-monitoring.html?301=en-us-software-synthetic-monitoring&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Splunk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.catchpoint.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Catchpoint&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrelic.com/products/synthetics&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;New Relic Synthetics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With a synthetic solution, you can simulate page loads from multiple geographic locations, report on performance trends over time, and scrub out any outliers. This method will give you the most complete and comprehensive set of data to ensure your digital experience platform’s recording script will fit within your performance budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Alternatively, you may choose to use an open-source solution such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitespeed.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sitespeed.io&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and create a custom dashboard to watch metrics over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Curious to see for yourself?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Contact us&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to request a tailored performance review of FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Intelligence platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#x27;ll partner with your engineering team to deploy FullStory in an environment where you can measure how we stack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

But no one could have predicted just how fast that change would come on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. Restaurants were just the tip of the iceberg for this change—retailers, airlines, casinos, and countless other industries felt a dramatic pinch, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/industries-most-and-least-impacted-by-covid19-from-a-probability-of-default-perspective-september-2020-update&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;S&amp;amp;P Global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While many industries couldn&amp;#x27;t make a perfect pivot, the most successful ones were those that focused on mobile. Consumers spent a whopping &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zdnet.com/article/mobile-app-usage-booms-during-covid-19-says-app-annie/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;1.6 trillion hours&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on mobile in the first half of 2020, alongside a 220% increase in time spent in business apps such as Zoom and LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No matter what industry you’re in—enterprise, financial, SaaS, or direct-to-consumer energy drinks or organic carpet cleaning—the competition is fierce. For many teams, identifying and relentlessly pursuing competitive advantages means a renewed focus on mobile experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Customers now expect fast, seamless, and accurate ordering from their smartphones and tablets. Well-orchestrated, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;data-driven&lt;/a&gt; mobile apps can boost sales, foster brand loyalty, and drive revenue–three things that are imperative in industries with neck-and-neck competition. Despite this, the quality and effectiveness of an app is often an afterthought compared to desktop or mobile browser experiences. &lt;b&gt;Releasing a mobile app is merely the starting point—not the finish line—especially in a world where &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalapptesting.com/blog/app-users-today-have-no-time-for-poor-quality&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;more than a third of smartphone users&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; would delete an app if they encounter a software bug.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you start, scale, and see success with a mobile-focused strategy, keep your eye on the end goal. Smart teams know that developing and releasing a mobile app is just the first mile in the long journey to delivering a successful, five-star mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One of the fundamental steps on the road to success? Identifying and tracking the right metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The mobile metrics your team must track&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Though measuring your mobile experience might seem similar to analyzing your website, there are several key differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Here are some of the most important KPIs and user engagement metrics FullStory clients leverage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/mobile-apps/&quot;&gt;measuring their mobile apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Mobile downloads&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It feels obvious. The number of times that an app is downloaded, the more popular it is with users. After all, the number of downloads of a mobile app is directly proportional to the success of the app in most cases. Imagine having a million downloads over a period of six months. Think of all those customers! All those orders! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While important, the number of mobile downloads is not the only thing teams should measure. Look at other types of engagement once someone downloads the app. Are users interacting with the app? What does conversion look like? Mobile downloads may be the topmost performance metric of a mobile app, but it’s just one factor in measuring overall app success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Uninstalls&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Though a user has downloaded your mobile app, their initial excitement to place an order might dwindle after a month. Industry research firm Singular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.singular.net/blog/app-uninstall-rates-and-coronavirus-lockdown-is-bad-for-retention/#:~:text=While%20the%20average%20uninstall%20rate,off%20their%20phones%20more%20frequently.&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the average rate of uninstalls (a complete deletion of an app from a device) across all mobile operating systems is 36.4%. In other words, for every 100 times an app is installed, 36.4 uninstalls–a complete deletion of an app from a device–will follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Uninstalls are inevitable. However, if there are more people uninstalling the app than there are installing it, that poses a risk to your long-term success. You need to uncover the reason(s) people are abandoning your app. Does the app not satisfy user expectations? Is the app irrelevant for the user? Does it use too much memory, draining battery power?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each uninstall is an opportunity for learning and, in addition to measuring things like system performance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/qualitative-data/&quot;&gt;understanding user engagement can provide valuable insights&lt;/a&gt;. Engagement is an important metric to gauge the health of the app, and, when combined with other metrics, is a critical piece in understanding the users’ experience. The more users are engaged with your app, the less likely they are to churn, and the more money they’re likely to spend with your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Retention rate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Retention rate measures how many users continue using your application after using it once or twice. Without a retention strategy in place, you’ll likely find it difficult to keep your users interested in your app. For example, a customer downloaded your app during quarantine for touch-free purchase. With the ongoing evolution of restrictions, will that same person use the app moving forward?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A “good” retention rate for a mobile app depends on many factors: the business model of the application, user base, niche, etc. SaaS-based businesses, for example, may measure retention in terms of subscription. An app that is useful only during specific times of year–like a holiday game–will have a lower retention rate during months when there are no holidays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Although exact benchmarks vary by industry, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geckoboard.com/best-practice/kpi-examples/retention-rate/#:~:text=Industry%20Benchmarks,is%2032%25%20to%2066%25.&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent report from Geckoboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; states that mobile apps on average have a 30-day retention rate of 42% and a 90-day retention rate of 25%. The average 30-day rate broken down by industry ranges from 27% to 43%, but for higher performing apps, that range is 32% to 66%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Remarketing, in-app messaging, push notifications, smooth onboarding processes, and predictive insights can increase your retention rate. Each is a part of the digital experience worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Churn rate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A companion metric to retention is churn, or the percentage of users who stop using an app after a certain period of time. The retention rate is the percentage of people who continue to use your app over a given period of time (week, month, or quarter). This is the inverse of user churn. As illustrated above, if your 90-day retention rate is 25%, then your churn is 75%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Churn is even more significant when it’s your best or most active users (e.g., top revenue-generating users) who are abandoning your app. If there were 100 customers in a restaurant and 75 left without ordering anything, that would raise some eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Churn rate is governed by many factors: a confusing customer onboarding process, lack of desired features, generally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/7-causes-of-bad-user-experiences/&quot;&gt;poor user experience&lt;/a&gt;, etc. It goes without saying that you want your mobile app retention to be high and your churn low. Additionally, if you want your app to grow, the number of users who leave should be lower than the number of new users. As such, reducing churn rate can improve retention and drive revenue for your business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Sessions &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The number of sessions measures the number of times a user opens or interacts with your mobile application. Technically speaking, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/digital-experience-intelligence-platform/&quot;&gt;digital analytics&lt;/a&gt; defines a session as a user- or device-specific group of interactions that occur on your website or app within a given time frame. Generally speaking, the more sessions a user generates on your app, or the greater the app’s stickiness, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Active users are those who launch your mobile app every day and perform some kind of action on it. If you see a decline in your daily or monthly active users, you may need to explore different strategies to market the app to those who have already downloaded it. Many businesses consider daily users as their primary metric to measure app growth and engagement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Session intervals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session intervals are another important metric for helping you understand how frequently your customers are opening your mobile application, and measuring the time between the user’s first session and his or her next one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session intervals can serve as a great early indicator for retention. When you know the typical time lapse between sessions per user segment, you can quickly spot any changes and proactively optimize the user experience to prompt regular opens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, if you notice the sessions of tablet users are longer than those of smartphone users, it might be that you need to improve screen flow or design in your tablet app. It could also be an indication that you should consider adding contextual in-app or push messaging to encourage more immersive interaction on a regular basis. Either could lead to a positive change in terms of shortening the interval between sessions for those tablet users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Session length and depth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition to sessions and session intervals, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;important to understand the details behind a session&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session length, defined as the total time users spend on your app per session, can show how engaging your app is, while session depth is a metric that tells you how close your users were to the target action, such as cart checkout. (If you need a quick benchmark to vet your own performance, Statista &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/243779/total-minutes-spent-on-average-app-by-category/&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an average session time for mobile shopping apps at five minutes and 28 seconds.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session length provides product managers with valuable insight into the user experience. For example, session length can be used to correlate the time users invest in the app with the quality of the experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But session length might be misleading in terms of engagement. Many might think that a longer session length is desirable. For many businesses, long sessions imply that there might be problems with user experience, that the user is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/how-to-use-session-replay-for-conversion-rate-optimization/&quot;&gt;struggling with solving their problems quickly&lt;/a&gt;. For example, customizations may drive excess time and create confusion, or a poorly functioning store locator may require input of multiple addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session depth offers an interesting alternative, or companion metric, to show how successful a session has been for your user. Session depth is defined as the number of successful interactions per session–for example, how many steps in a checkout flow the customer completed before abandoning an order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Heatmaps and user session recreations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The quantitative measures offered by the metrics above offer one part of the equation. Recreating the user session and watching how the user interacts with the  app can be invaluable in illustrating how an app makes a user feel and how enjoyable–and effective–it is to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/heatmap/&quot;&gt;Heatmaps&lt;/a&gt; track the areas on a screen that users interact with the most. User recordings, on the other hand, monitor the actual user as he or she interacts with the app. Heatmaps are useful for seeing which features they spend more time on and which features they miss. Use these metrics to understand &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; particular things happened and to help inform theories about the causes of any friction, frustration, and problems. Examine how long particular tasks take. The time spent on a task can indicate if something is particularly difficult or confusing for users. It can also show if something is fun, engaging, and easy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next steps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can’t manage what you can’t measure. Mobile app data informs smart decisions, but only when that data is gathered and utilized correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The above outlines some of the most common metrics for measuring your mobile app performance–but it’s important to ensure that the KPIs you’re tracking are in alignment with your business’s specific business goals. With the pros and cons of the most relevant mobile app metrics laid out, your team can align on each one and establish a clear view of how user experiences perform and how you can most effectively optimize them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With FullStory’s Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) platform, teams can effortlessly uncover the qualitative and quantitative data behind mobile apps, yielding actionable insights for teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;See how FullStory works for your team. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo/&quot;&gt;Request a demo with FullStory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mapping a Path to Digital Experience Maturity: Outcomes]]></title><description><![CDATA[The digital experience outcomes that mature organizations are focusing on. ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/resources/digital-experience-maturity-outcomes</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/resources/digital-experience-maturity-outcomes</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[FullStory]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the final webinine in our Mapping a Path to Digital Experience Maturity series, Anna Howarth, High Touch Customer Success Manager at FullStory, walks through what mature digital experience organizations are doing differently regarding organizational mindset in less than nine minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[GDPR and FullStory]]></title><description><![CDATA[Everything you need to know about FullStory and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). ]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/resources/gdpr-and-fullstory</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/resources/gdpr-and-fullstory</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[FullStory]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the General Data Protection Regulation and FullStory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Last updated May 2021&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First, a disclaimer: The content below is provided for informational purposes only. The information shared here is not meant to serve as legal advice. You should work closely with legal and other professional counsel to determine exactly how the GDPR may or may not apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In this article: If you’ve landed here, you’ve likely already heard lots about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). There is already &lt;a href=&quot;https://kb.mailchimp.com/binaries/content/assets/mailchimpkb/us/en/pdfs/mailchimp_gdpr_sept2017.pdf&quot;&gt;a lot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@reply.io/everything-you-should-know-about-gdpr-2018-70d9fa3da61e&quot;&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; content that explains in detail what the GDPR is. Here, we’ll mostly focus on the intersection of the GDPR, your company, and your use of FullStory session replay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. What is the GDPR?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At a basic level, the GDPR is intended to give more control to EU citizens over their personal data. Among other things, it regulates how people and organizations can obtain, use, store and eliminate personal data of EU citizens. The ideas in the GDPR actually aren’t so new. Many of the concepts in the GDPR were introduced over 20 years ago when the EU adopted the Data Protection Directive in the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The GDPR seems to represent a real sea change, giving people strong agency in how their personal data is collected and used. Unlike the Directive from the mid-90s, the GDPR:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;is much more specific about what is okay and not okay,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;introduces a broader definition of personal data,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;sets forth such stringent requirements that companies are required to make real operational changes,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;is completely uniform across the EU, leaving a lot less wiggle room for interpretation, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;enforces penalties that are really, really steep; it’s clear that the EU wants to ensure real change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. What does the GDPR require?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A bunch of stuff, but because it’s new, it can be hard to say exactly how the GDPR requirements map onto specific operational changes. Some of the key concepts are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being really clear about what constitutes personal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being really clear about ensuring that personal data is used only with a user’s explicit consent or some other lawful basis for processing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping data secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving EU citizens a set of rights with respect to their personal data, including things like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the right to see what data a company has collected about them,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the right to control how that data is shared with other companies,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the right to have all of their data deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s take a closer look at how these GDPR requirements can be applied to FullStory and session replay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is considered “personal data?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;According to the GDPR, personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual, which could mean any information that could be used either on its own or in conjunction with other data, to identify an individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Sensitive personal data, such as social security numbers, health information, or information that suggests a person’s racial or ethnic origin will require even greater protection under the GDPR. This kind of sensitive personal data should never be captured by FullStory (it’s against our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/legal/acceptable-use/&quot;&gt;Acceptable Use Policy&lt;/a&gt;) and we have provided some &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623574&quot;&gt;easy-to-use tools&lt;/a&gt; that allow you to exclude sensitive data from ever being recorded by FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Before we go further, just what &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; recorded by FullStory and why? The power of FullStory is linked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;session replay&amp;quot; (a.k.a. session playback)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is session replay?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session replay is the reproduction of a user’s interactions on a website or web application exactly as the user actually experienced it. Session replay transforms logged user events, such as mouse movements, clicks, page visits, scrolling, tapping, etc., into a reproduction of what the user did on the site or app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The reproductions provided by session replay are used to recreate the &lt;i&gt;experiences of actual users&lt;/i&gt;. Replay is useful for all sorts of reasons—e.g. to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/session-replay-customer-support/&quot;&gt;support customers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/debugging-with-session-replay/&quot;&gt;debug errors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/session-replay-conversion-rate-optimization/&quot;&gt;optimize pages&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In order for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;any session replay tool&lt;/a&gt; to work, session replay vendors must log user behaviors on websites and apps down to clicks, taps, scrolls, mouse movements, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;How might you capture personal data With FullStory session replay?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are two types of personal data you can send to FullStory. You can actively send things like name, email address, company, etc. to FullStory using &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828113&quot;&gt;our API&lt;/a&gt; or one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001589654-Integrations&quot;&gt;our integrations&lt;/a&gt;. You can also passively send personal information that your visitors are typing into fields or that might get displayed on pages of your website or app that FullStory logs simply because we are recording the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As mentioned above, in the case of passively captured information, you have full control over which fields or elements are excluded, and it is important that you exclude the personal data that you do not want captured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;As a FullStory customer, how should I think about FullStory with respect to the GDPR?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For FullStory customers, FullStory is a processor of data that you send to us about your users. To understand how FullStory session replay operates with respect to the data you send it, a helpful metaphor is to think of FullStory as a provider of safe deposit boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you use FullStory on your site, you are sending data about your users (which may or may not be personal data) into your FullStory account, which is like your very own safe deposit box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the same way that a bank doesn’t access the contents of your safe deposit box, FullStory doesn’t access the data in your FullStory account. You’ll work directly with your customers to honor their requests about the data you have captured and stored about them whether it is in your FullStory account or not. We will help by providing tools that allow you to easily access, change, remove and delete the data in your FullStory account at your user’s request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because FullStory is a processor, you may need to obtain consent from your identified users for the way that you plan to use FullStory to process their data. If so, we suggest you be as clear as possible about how you use FullStory and why your end users might want to grant you consent to identify them for those purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, if you use FullStory on your support team, you could explain that you use FullStory session replay to provide faster and better support to your customers and aid your engineering team in solving bugs and improving their user experience. We believe that being more descriptive about how you’re using data to ultimately help your customers will improve the likelihood that they grant consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do I need to obtain consent before recording sessions with FullStory?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Not necessarily. The GDPR is primarily concerned with personal data and defining the rights that an EU citizen has to their own data. An unidentified session that cannot be traced to a certain individual is just that, unidentified, and as such recording that session for the purpose of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay/session playback&lt;/a&gt; is a-ok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, as noted above, it is possible to capture personal or sensitive data passively if you are recording forms or pages where personal data is inputed or displayed on your website or application. It is important that you audit your own site and ensure all appropriate form fields or elements are excluded &lt;i&gt;before you start recording&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;But&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; what about IP Address?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is a great question and it seems this is still up for interpretation. However, in FullStory you have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020622834&quot;&gt;ability to discard IP addresses&lt;/a&gt;. While we hold the IP address while a session is processed, once processing is complete the IP address is discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. How will FullStory empower me to honor my users&amp;#x27; requests around their own personal data?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Under the GDPR, EU citizens have certain rights with respect to their own data. As you think about FullStory’s role in helping you honor your users’ rights, it is helpful to revisit the safe deposit box metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you choose, with consent or some other lawful basis, to record or pass into FullStory personal data about your visitors, that data goes into your FullStory account. As mentioned above, you’ll work directly with your customers to honor their requests about the data you have captured and stored about them whether it is in your FullStory account or not. FullStory will help by providing tools that allow you to easily access, change, remove and delete that data at your user’s request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s dive into some specific rights introduced via the GDPR and how FullStory will help you honor those rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Right to be forgotten&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory users with admin privileges can entirely &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828373&quot;&gt;erase users&lt;/a&gt; from their account at the click of a button after confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After a user is completely deleted, a discreet email is sent acting as a receipt to confirm that the appropriate action has been taken. We also offer an &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624174&quot;&gt;API endpoint for deleting users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Right to object&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Under the GDPR, users have the right to prohibit certain data uses. As mentioned above, you may need to get explicit consent from EU citizens regarding the data you capture and how you plan to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We already covered how you might send personal data into your FullStory account (actively via our Identify API or an integration, or passively by capturing pages on which personal data is inputted or displayed). It is already possible to choose not to actively or passively send any personal data into FullStory simply by not using our Identify API and by excluding all elements (like form fields or confirmation pages) that might have personal information typed into or displayed on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You’ll be able to set more granular rules about what data is passed into FullStory by default and what data can be passed into FullStory when consent is present. This functionality will be part of our new Consent API (more details coming).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Right of access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your users may contact you to request to access information that you hold about them. You’ll be able to log into your FullStory account and quickly do a search for your user in order to understand what personal data of theirs you’ve sent to FullStory and help construct your response to your user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data portability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As mentioned above, any end user data that is in your FullStory account, is yours (and theirs), but not ours. You will be able to quickly understand what data you do have about your user thanks to our search functionality and Data Export. Then you can hand it over to the customer however you choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Please read &amp;quot;GDPR Made to Order&amp;quot; to learn about &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/gdpr-features-fullstory-session-replay/&quot;&gt;how the FullStory app works to accommodate GDPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Does FullStory offer a Data Processing Agreement (DPA)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yes. You can view and sign our DPA online: &lt;a href=&quot;https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=80263e03-8609-4103-9a5e-324982f1d9ea&quot;&gt;FullStory Data Processing Agreement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you follow that link, you&amp;#x27;ll need to authenticate your access using an emailed verification code. You will have the chance to read the document prior to signing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. How will I know if I’m compliant with the GDPR?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There does not yet appear to be any sort certification process by which you can be assured that you are in compliance. As we mentioned earlier, you should work closely with legal and other professional counsel to determine if you’re in compliance with the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each company that wants to serve EU citizens will need to remain vigilant and pay attention to how GDPR may evolve, and make changes to accommodate any additional clarifications that appear over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.

A decade later, the average time online is forecasted to surge by more than 230%. As more time is spent online across desktop and mobile devices, companies’ digital experiences need to meet the rising expectations of their customers and end users. Many companies turn to analytics tools and platforms to find answers about their user experience and optimize their website or application. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To be truly effective, any platform designed to help you perfect your digital experience should be able to scale with your company’s growth–without burdening you with an overwhelming amount of data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While there are several tools on the market that automatically collect and index all user interaction data, best-in-class solutions go a step further: they transform this information into pre-configured signals that evolve beyond interaction metrics (i.e. clicks, page visits) to proactively surface trends in user frustration and engagement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foundational interaction events and metrics &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Interaction events, such as clicks or page visits, are the foundation for more complex signals that surface user frustration and engagement. While interaction events are crucial for analyzing the basics of your digital experience, they only give you surface-level intelligence about how many people are interacting with your website or product. Often, this basic interaction data requires heavy technical intervention and setup to illuminate the context behind each event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, a spike in button clicks in your product might seem noteworthy. However, without digging deeper into the analysis, you might not realize the clicks came from a small set of users in a short time period—the results of frustration with a broken button. To efficiently spot trends and proactively improve your digital experience, patterns in user interactions should be packaged into deeper frustration and engagement signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Signals to spot user frustration and friction &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;We found recently that &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/digital-experience-consumer-survey&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;77% of consumers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; are likely to leave without completing a transaction if they encounter an error.&lt;/b&gt; At this rate, poor experiences across thousands of interactions can have severe impacts on your revenue. To quickly spot friction points in your digital experience, look for a solution that automatically codifies and surfaces user pain in real time through well-established frustration signals like Rage Clicks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Frustration signals that surface friction in the user experience include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rage Clicks &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks are generated by users who repeatedly click on an element in frustration, signaling a misalignment of user expectation and product action. For example, a broken “View My Cart” button could spark users to rapidly and repeatedly click the button with hopes that the page will change. Watching for Rage Click activity can reveal quick wins for improving the user journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Error and Dead Clicks &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Error Clicks and Dead Clicks are useful signals for finding bugs or other barriers to success in your product. If your DX contains bold, blue text, a user might expect this to link to another page. If clicking the text results in no action or change, this would register as a Dead Click. On the other hand, an Error Click is captured if clicking results in a client-side JavaScript error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Over the years, we’ve solved countless UX and customer service issues using FullStory, and we continue to use it for those purposes every day. Few customers who have a problem on your site actually leave feedback, so if three customers report an issue, that likely represents hundreds who’ve experienced it. FullStory is crucial to understanding and fixing those issues quickly.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Michael Moore, CTO/CIO, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moosejaw&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thrashed Cursor &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Cursor thrashing, or rapidly moving the cursor/ mouse around a page, can be an indication of slow site performance or a user’s inability to complete an action in your product. Keeping an eye on the frequency of cursor thrashing across your customer base can help you understand performance and inform UX decisions or customer education plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Find out how Yakima Chief Hops was able to proactively identify 30% of defects before customers were impacted by monitoring frustration signals and using FullStory to recreate user experiences. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.ctfassets.net/dkgr2j75jrom/7slEaseq5EHDDTsRYmPLbU/234a627bb29969fa2f6135cf67a3adf1/fs-yakima-chief-1-pager-lowres.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;→&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pinch-to-Zoom &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;End users often use the pinch-to-zoom gesture when text, images, or other website elements are too small. Surges or trends in customers using pinch-to-zoom are effective in determining ways to improve the user experience through additional visuals or adjustments to page design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Refreshed &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;High counts of page refreshes can signal performance problems across a website or product. If an image or video element is broken or missing, page refreshes can indicate that users expected an on-screen change that didn’t appear. When there are problems with page rendering, visitors may refresh the page or application in an attempt to fix the problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“FullStory has changed the way we work. We’ve gotten so much value out of the tool across teams, from our Business Intelligence (BI) team using Data Export to enrich their data models, to being able to quantify the impact of pain points on our site, to smoother
communication between customer support and product. It’s been a game-changer and we love it.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;- Matthew LeGare, Senior Director of Digital Product Management, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Younique Products&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Discover your most engaging content and product areas &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While fixing friction is hugely important, another critical piece of the puzzle is exploring how your users are engaging with your content–and to what result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Investigating and optimizing the content customers are using to complete a task can be highly informative for improving conversions, speeding time to checkout, and increasing overall satisfaction. Engagement signals and insights for perfecting the digital experience include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scroll Depth &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Are your customers actually reading valuable long-form content? Is there important functionality below the fold of certain product pages? Monitoring how far users scroll down a page can provide insight into the type of content your customers engage with most or even inform decisions around product design and layout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highlighted &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Monitoring which on-screen elements are highlighted by end users can also provide insight into the ways customers are interacting with content across the digital experience. For example, an ecommerce shop can understand the impact of comparison shopping on their conversion rates by analyzing how frequently customers highlight specific elements, such as product names, to paste and search for lower prices elsewhere. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Element Visibility &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Products and websites often have tooltips, banners, alerts, and other content that appears without user interaction or only under certain user conditions (i.e. “Loading” animation is visible). Many times, it’s important to understand how conditional content elements impact user engagement and experience. If a “loading...” text element is visible to most users for several seconds before showing a piece of content, this could signal an opportunity to improve performance and drive better content engagement. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“FullStory comes up in every voice of customer meeting. We are able to walk people through the actual pain points shoppers are facing and show what we found and how we were able to quickly resolve the issue. Or how we plan to improve the digital experience to add more value for shoppers.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yi Cao, Senior Manager, Product Research, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hudson’s Bay Company&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;

While they’re concerned about aesthetics and optimization, you’re focused on the system working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re interested in a digital experience intelligence (DXI) platform to get a deeper understanding of user interactions and how to correct them, you’re in the right spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We’ve talked to hundreds of engineers, and these are some of the most common questions we hear about DXI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ready to hear more?

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;8 Questions Engineers Should Ask About Digital Experience Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How is data logged from a site or mobile device? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;DXI solutions log data via &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;session replay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session replay is a reproduction of a user’s interactions on a website or app exactly how the user actually experienced it. It transforms logged user events and element interaction, such as mouse movements, clicks, and page visits, into a reproduction—not a video capture—of what the user actually did on the site or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why? This prevents sessions from being recorded in native screen resolutions (resulting in gigantic video file sizes) or downscaled recordings (resulting in choppy, low-fidelity playback). Experience what the user experienced, just as they saw it, but without cumbersome video files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does this put user privacy at risk?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;In a word: never.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Protecting your users’ privacy isn’t optional. So, by default, digital experience intelligence solutions never log any personally identifiable information (PII). When there’s no PII gathered, there’s no PII at risk to be compromised. Excluded elements will never leave the user’s device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, digital experience intelligence solutions are fully compliant with GDPR and certified under both the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do I need a team of people to implement and onboard a DXI platform?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For web properties, DXI solutions are installed by pasting a Javascript snippet into the &amp;lt;HEAD&amp;gt; element. Mobile app developers just need to install an SDK for the platform (iOS, Android, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;That’s it. Your site or app is now synched with the tool, and vice versa.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As far as onboarding is concerned, there’s no need for extra invites to your weekly standup Zoom call. DXI tools are designed to be extremely easy to use, right from day one. Plus, many offer &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rigorous, detailed help documentation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you have a question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Additionally, for larger enterprise teams, many DXI tools offer consulting services and customer success teams for expedited, smooth onboarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does DXI work with the rest of my stack?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;You bet.&lt;/b&gt; DXI solutions offer a flourishing ecosystem of integrations. By design, this gives engineers easy access to the information they need to do their jobs, no matter which tools they spend time in. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/integrations&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Popular integrations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; include Qualtrics, Drift, Slack, Shopify, and Gainsight, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can DXI help illustrate the value of my work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yes.&lt;/b&gt; A huge benefit of DXI is quantifying the value of engineering work. Now, it’s easier than ever to draw a direct line between site performance and revenue impact, helping prove the value of development work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For instance, see the number of lost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/blog/conversions-by-fullstory&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conversions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; associated with friction and frustration points, then resolve and watch quantitative impact. No more black box revenue calculations or panicked looks when asked how your role contributes to overall company health.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does installing a DXI make our app or site slower?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;DXI solutions such as FullStory are carefully constructed and measured to ensure they have negligible impact on site performance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Take &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/customer-story/ecommerce-retail/carvana&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Carvana&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. After installing FullStory’s Digital Experience Intelligence solution on their site, the Carvana team created their own A/B test to ensure that capturing extensive data from FullStory wasn’t hindering functionality. The conclusion: 8m+ site visitors, no discernable site performance impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let’s go a bit more technical. Can I see how page performance, speed, and reliability impact user experience?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best-in-class DXI tools offer &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828313-Guide-to-Dev-Tools&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dev Tools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, a collection of metrics that keep tabs on page speed, network view, and slowest pages. &lt;/b&gt;Dev Tools provide insights to engineering teams, helping them know what network requests looked like in a user’s browser, plus page speed metrics, stack tracing, console recording, and network requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I only see things that have happened, or can DXI help me make proactive updates?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;DXI solutions are designed for both proactive and retroactive updates&lt;/b&gt;—making changes based on existing user challenges and helping you understand user behaviors en masse to help predict issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;By measuring and monitoring user behavior and setting alerts to sound when key pages aren’t performing to the level you need them to, you can balance focus development effort between extinguishing current fires and anticipating future needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FullStory is the Digital Experience Intelligence solution designed for engineering teams.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Digital experience doesn’t rest on the shoulders of UX or product teams.

And this year, it’s more important than ever to plan ahead and make every customer touchpoint count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This holiday preparedness checklist is designed to help FullStory users assess your strategy’s strengths and weaknesses, and to offer actions to make sure you are getting the most out of FullStory this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Complete the checklist to make sure you are prepared for this holiday season:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check in on your checkout flow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quickly identify and address site performance issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up tracking to understand the efficacy of your holiday promotions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expect the unexpected and use FullStory to mitigate risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinpoint where to improve your&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;mobile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;shopping experience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Check in on your checkout flow using FullStory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Just because someone has entered your checkout flow doesn’t mean they will purchase. When the smallest inconvenience can lead them to abandon—and your competitors are quite literally a click away—it becomes critical that you make it as easy as possible for a potential customer to complete their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fortunately, you’re already ahead of the game as a FullStory user. Here’s how you can use the platform to optimize your checkout flow in preparation for the holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to use FullStory to address friction in your checkout flow&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First, ensure you are properly monitoring your checkout flow. Laying the groundwork now to understand how your checkout flow is performing will allow you to pinpoint (and fix) problem spots &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the holiday shopping rush. Here’s how to set it up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1: Identify the events in your checkout flow and build Metric(s) to monitor these events&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Built on FullStory Search, Metrics are simply an Event (click, page visit, error, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623274-FS-event-API-Sending-custom-event-data-into-FullStory&quot;&gt;Custom Event&lt;/a&gt;), aggregation type, and a format (%, $, etc). The aggregations available include count of the event itself, how many users performed the event, the number of sessions in which the event was performed, or a calculation of Custom Event properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s say your checkout flow has six primary steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add to cart &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add shipping information &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add payment information &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review order &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click “Purchase” &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirmation page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You would build a Metric for each of these Events:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For each Metric, you can summarize the data in different ways. You can examine the number of users, events, or sessions that performed the Event, calculate a ratio of Events, or even find the aggregate of the Event&amp;#x27;s property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can also explore each Metric by comparing different Segments of users or plotting different properties via Dimensions, such as browser type and time range:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2: Combine your Metrics into a Dashboard to monitor the entire checkout flow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To monitor your checkout flow as a whole, you’ll want to set up a Dashboard—a custom visualization using your FullStory data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We recommend building a Funnel Card in your Dashboard. This Card will show you the overall completion rate from the first step to the last within your checkout flow, as well as the number of users who make it to each step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you have monitoring set up using Metrics and Dashboards, you should turn your attention to optimizing the checkout process. If you notice a large drop off on one step within your Funnel, for example, you can dive into that particular Metric. FullStory will always surface applicable sessions for both Metrics and each Dashboard Card, so that you can understand &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; users might be dropping out of your checkout flow at that particular step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: With FullStory’s Conversions product (available on enterprise plans only), you can be proactive about fixing problem spots in your checkout flow.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversions automatically detects strong “signals” that could be impacting your funnel—like a specific performance issue on your site or a confusing interaction for your customers—and distinguishes these signals from the background noise of your everyday “business as usual.” It surfaces and prioritizes a list of things to fix, as opposed to reactive monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you have access to Conversions, you should use it to assess your checkout flow—and prioritize fixes in preparation for the holiday shopping season. Here’s how to create an analysis in Conversions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use the Conversions Composer to select exactly what you want to analyze:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a Conversion Funnel consisting of at least two steps. (In our example above, it would include the six primary steps in your checkout flow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose the cohort of users you’d like to pass through your funnel. It’s a good idea to start with “Everyone” and then get more specific later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set the date range you’d like to analyze. We suggest the past week or past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Optional) Choose to add or remove any additional signals you want to be examined in the analysis. For your first funnel, it’s fine to use the default settings, which include frustration signals and page load speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &amp;quot;Analyze&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Optional) Save your Conversion Analysis for later use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Conversions will automatically prioritize opportunities based on the strongest signals we detect from user behavior in the funnel. You can dive into specific results to learn more about the opportunity, including details such as how many and how severely users are impacted, and to watch relevant sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Quickly identify and address site performance issues using FullStory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s no secret that a slow-loading website is a quick way to lose would-be customers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/&quot;&gt;Google reports&lt;/a&gt; that more than half of people bounce if a page takes longer than 3 seconds to load. While tracking site performance is important all year, it’s especially critical during the holiday season when sites and apps experience higher-than-normal traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is where Dev Tools from FullStory comes in: Dev Tools unlocks the power to understand how page performance—speed and reliability—is impacting your digital customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Specifically, you’ll want to look at &lt;b&gt;Page Speed Metrics&lt;/b&gt;. Page speed metrics allow you to see page timing milestones for every page that loads during any session. Available metrics include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Contentful Paint (FCP): The First Contentful Paint event relates to the moment when the first element from the DOM appears in the users&amp;#x27; browser. Here at FullStory, we believe that this metric relates most closely to a user&amp;#x27;s experience in terms of perceiving a page to be &amp;quot;loaded&amp;quot; and we use FCP as our own benchmark for page speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOMContentLoaded (DCL): DOMContentLoaded gives you a feel for how long it took for the HTML to load so that the page can start rendering content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page Load: The onload event or &amp;quot;Page Load&amp;quot; fires when the whole page and all of its dependent resources have finished loading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Because page speed metrics are available as search criteria for OmniSearch and Segments, you can layer these timings onto any of your funnels or Segments to learn more about performance in the context of specific pages or groups of sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can also use the &lt;b&gt;Slowest Pages report&lt;/b&gt; to see the slowest pages related to any search or segment, by First Contentful Paint. This report gives you an excellent signal to understand where to improve your performance and also where you might want to search to find slow sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For &lt;b&gt;enterprise users&lt;/b&gt;, you can set up Segment Alerts to ensure you have visibility into how people are engaging with your site &lt;i&gt;even when you aren’t logged into FullStory&lt;/i&gt;. For example, you may want to set an alert to be notified “if more people than usual have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828873&quot;&gt;first contentful paint time&lt;/a&gt; greater than 5 seconds on mobile.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Simply…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020829633#Segment&quot;&gt;Save a segment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create an alert for that segment by choosing a threshold number. You will be notified when the number of users goes above or below the threshold number you set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a description for your alert and decide if you&amp;#x27;d like to be notified by Slack or email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save and then go about your work, and FullStory will notify you when your threshold number is passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Beyond tracking and alerting via slack and email, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045134554-Webhooks&quot;&gt;FullStory Webhooks&lt;/a&gt; to trigger particular workflows in real time. For example, fire a Webhook Event to page an engineer in PagerDuty when a Segment indicating slow performance exceeds a set threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When site performance dips, you can dig into specific sessions and access Dev Tools; this will show you the network view, so you can quickly assess what’s going on. With Webhooks, you can make a Note of the issue and push that Note directly into your engineering’s team’s queue. And if you’re on an enterprise plan, make sure you have alerts set up to notify as soon as there is a site performance issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each of these will help you speed time-to-resolution, ensuring your site is fast for your holiday shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Track the efficacy of your holiday promotions with FullStory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your marketing team is likely already running holiday promotions (and the sooner, the better). And they are likely using UTM parameters to understand where web traffic is coming from so that they can assess the success of these promotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Which brings us to FullStory. You can visualize the performance of your UTM link parameters, using the Top UTM Source, Medium, and Campaign &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828673&quot;&gt;Cards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These Cards appear at the bottom of your screen automatically and will change each time you update your search. If there are any users in your current search or saved Segment who visited pages with UTM-source, -medium, or -campaign parameters, you&amp;#x27;ll automatically see the corresponding Card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your segment doesn&amp;#x27;t contain any visitors who landed on a UTM-tagged page, these Cards won&amp;#x27;t appear. Likewise, if the segment contains utm-source data but not utm-campaign data, then Top UTM Source Card will appear but not the Top UTM Campaign Card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To zoom in on the customers who visited you through a particular source, medium, or campaign, simply click the corresponding bar in the Card and your search will instantly be updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can also use the Top Referrers &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828673&quot;&gt;Card&lt;/a&gt; in FullStory, which appears alongside any search or saved segment. This Card highlights the top referrer, plus a number of the next most common referrers, and indicates how many users visited you via that referrer. If you&amp;#x27;d like to quickly zoom into the users from a single referrer, just click one of the bars in the Card and your search is instantly created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Evaluating the success of your promotional campaigns using FullStory&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can use FullStory to understand which marketing or ad campaign channels are driving the most purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First, identify the UTM parameters on your marketing or social media campaign link. Remember, FullStory will automatically pull in the UTM campaigns, sources, and mediums—no special planning or preliminary tracking work required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Next, open FullStory Omnisearch and just start typing &amp;quot;utm_campaign=&amp;quot; and the name of your campaign. Right away, you can see how many people had sessions on your site from that campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Scroll down to see the Top UTM Sources and Top UTM Mediums results to understand which channels and types of content or ads are performing best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To understand whether this traffic is actually driving conversions, go back to Omnisearch and start typing the path of the confirmation page that your shoppers visit when they complete a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Adding the additional layer of the conversion event to search will filter the sessions to only those visitors from the campaign who later converted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Once you&amp;#x27;ve built a funnel to understand whether traffic from your campaigns leads to purchase confirmations, you can flip the criteria for Has | Visited URL (path) | is | (your confirmation page) from &amp;quot;Has&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Has not&amp;quot; in order to see a list of sessions where people visited your site from your campaign and didn&amp;#x27;t complete a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch sessions within each segment: Where do drop-offs seem to occur?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for signals to understand the quality and intent of the campaign traffic: Do visitors seem to be engaging with your site and product pages? Do they seem to bounce right away? Does any of the traffic appear fraudulent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check to make sure the user experience is optimized: Did the page load quickly? Are there any errors or rendering problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use any insights to adjust your campaigns and landing pages &lt;i&gt;as they are running&lt;/i&gt; to maximize revenue from holiday promotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Expect the unexpected and use FullStory to mitigate risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;No matter how excellent your digital holiday strategy, unexpected issues are still likely to crop up. While you can’t predict exactly what those problems will be, you can build the infrastructure to ensure your teams can identify and fix issues as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Integrate your platforms so that digital information is easily accessible&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer Success &amp;amp; Customer Feedback Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Employees tend to be scattered during the holidays, and it can be difficult to keep track of who is on or offline on any given day. This will only be amplified this year, due to predominantly distributed professional spaces. By integrating your relevant technologies, you can rely on your tools rather than individual employees to notify the right folks at the right times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you haven’t already connected FullStory to your customer success and customer feedback management platforms, you should consider doing so in advance of the holiday season.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory works in tandem with your &lt;b&gt;customer success platform&lt;/b&gt; to provide insight into where customers struggle and why. The additional context via session replay means less back-and-forth with the customer and between internal teams. With FullStory connected to your success platform, you can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-browse with customers in real-time without forcing them to download any screenshare software with FullStory’s Go-Live capability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminate the need to ask your customers for an error message, a play-by-play, or a screenshot by instantly accessing a high-fidelity replay of the user’s session&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide useful stack trace data and console logs to your engineering team via each session replay, dramatically reducing time to resolution; no bug reproduction required&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trigger chatbots or live chat modals when FullStory recognizes that your customers are struggling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Similarly, FullStory provides additional context to the feedback you are collecting via your &lt;b&gt;customer feedback platform&lt;/b&gt;. Zoom in to see what happened before, during, and after a user left feedback, identify the root problem—and zoom out to understand the scale of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Make vague feedback like “your website sucks” or “your site is too buggy” actionable: Review the customer’s session and determine if it’s a bug or a UX issue, then pass the feedback and session replay to the appropriate team for an ideal fix and fast follow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624154-Rage-Clicks-Error-Clicks-Dead-Clicks-and-Thrashed-Cursor-Frustration-Signals&quot;&gt;Frustration Signals&lt;/a&gt; paired with Webhooks to trigger on-site survey intercepts or automate emails to solicit feedback—right when the user experiences digital friction; gain useful voice of customer insights that shed light on how the customer was feeling when they experienced the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://partners.fullstory.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;Browse our customer support platform integrations here →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bug Tracking &amp;amp; Team Collaboration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We all know that bugs are inevitable. It’s how you handle, track and address them that determines how much or little they impact your customers. For most teams, the key is to build as seamless a remediation process as possible: Set up bug tracking, identify and contextualize bugs, prioritize and quickly ship fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you integrate FullStory with your customer support platforms (explained above) &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;with your bug tracking and team collaboration solutions, you can rest easy knowing that you have visibility into bugs and issues surfaced from your support team &lt;i&gt;as well as&lt;/i&gt; from your bug tracking tool—and that everything is being funneled into your collaboration software with full context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using FullStory in tandem with your &lt;b&gt;bug tracking solution&lt;/b&gt; will allow you to reduce time to resolution. Your teams will get a session replay link alongside an error detection alert, so they can visualize the error and understand what happened before, during, and after a user encountered the issue. This eliminates the need to spend countless cycles trying to recreate the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When you integrate FullStory with your &lt;b&gt;team collaboration solution&lt;/b&gt;, your teams can easily identify an issue in FullStory and send all of the necessary context—including a session link, network console information, additional notes—directly to the appropriate parties, within the collaboration platform they already use. This setup allows the entire team to see updates in real time within the collaboration platform(s) that is already integrated into their daily workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/rs/002-LDF-436/images/MSS-Support-Stack.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn more about the different use cases and support solutions FullStory integrates with in The Modern Support Stack guide →&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use self-service functions so customers can better support themselves (and use FullStory to make sure they are working properly)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Anticipating the spike in traffic and support queries that come with the holiday shopping season, we recommend introducing self-service elements to your site where applicable. You may want to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask tenured support team members about the most common customer questions from holiday seasons past, and incorporate these into an easy-to-find FAQ on your website&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduce live chat to handle basic questions. If you already have live chat, ensure it is equipped to handle holiday-specific questions when possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make shipping and return information prominent on your website; don’t ask customers to hunt for this information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you are introducing any new elements to your digital experience, we recommend saving a Segment for each new element in FullStory so that you can easily keep tabs on whether these elements are functioning the way you want them to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, if you’ve introduced a new holiday-specific FAQs page, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020622754-Can-I-save-searches-that-I-use-frequently-create-a-segment-&quot;&gt;save a Segment&lt;/a&gt; based on that page URL. Add it to your starred Segments for easy access so you can check in on how customers are engaging with that page and flag anything out of the ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. Use FullStory to pinpoint where to improve your mobile shopping experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the past, mobile shoppers would often start their shopping journey with product research on their phones, but they were more likely to complete their purchase online via desktop or in a store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While this is still a common path to purchase, more and more customers come to mobile sites ready to buy.

In this environment, there&amp;#x27;s no room for friction—expectations have never been higher. It&amp;#x27;s critical to identify frustration in the online experience and fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What are the main drivers of frustration online? What are the identifiable signs of struggle? What&amp;#x27;s the future of frustration detection online? How do you use FullStory&amp;#x27;s frustraction signals to search for broken experiences on your website or app?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We answer all these questions in the &lt;i&gt;guide to finding and fixing customer frustration online.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. The state of customer frustration online&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Why do you get frustrated when you&amp;#x27;re online?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s simple: you&amp;#x27;re trying to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/&quot;&gt;get some job done&lt;/a&gt;—learn something, buy something, do some work—except you just can&amp;#x27;t ... &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; ... &lt;i&gt;do it&lt;/i&gt;. The site (or app!) is too slow, too complicated, confusing, roadblocked, &lt;i&gt;whatever&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This simple problem is the foundation of frustration. And if your livelihood depends on the web, you know: it doesn&amp;#x27;t take much struggle during these critical moments for your users to disappear. The Internet puts competitors a mere click, tap, or search away. That&amp;#x27;s why understanding, identifying, and eliminating the causes of user frustration online is critical for success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The 7 biggest causes of online frustration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that we&amp;#x27;ve identified the root of user frustration online, what are the most common offenders when it comes to bad user experiences online? If we can name the most notorious offenders of frustration, perhaps creating a &amp;quot;Most Wanted&amp;quot; list of bad UX, we can—maybe!—avoid these sneaky villains entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To that end, we list the 7 biggest causes of frustration online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. Clunky, dysfunctional, dated, or just &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; site or app elements and design&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;All the stuff presented on your site or app has the potential to delight, help, confuse, or frustrate customers. There is an almost limitless pool of things you can present on your site/app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Below are listed just a few ways to frustrate customers with design, UI/UX, or “stuff” you put on your site or app:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eye-catching, whizbang look-at-me elements. &lt;/b&gt;See animated GIFs in the mid-90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flash. &lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x27;Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Auto-play video (or music).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hiding/omitting common/useful navigation elements &lt;/b&gt;E.g. &amp;quot;Where is [Search | Login | Support | Contact | some other basic thing]?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Too clever navigation&lt;/b&gt;—i.e. using clever words for common navigation elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Too clever interfaces&lt;/b&gt;—here’s looking at you, Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text/images/elements that are &lt;b&gt;too big&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text/images/elements that are &lt;b&gt;too small&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Confusing icons &lt;/b&gt;i.e. icons don&amp;#x27;t clearly convey what they represent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Graphics for text.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Absent calls to action&lt;/b&gt;—what is the &amp;quot;Okay, now what ...&amp;quot; for your users? Every web page has a default call to action—it’s that X to close the browser tab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Performance&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We&amp;#x27;re sorry for doing this, but if you see this GIF and notice your heartrate pick-up, you&amp;#x27;re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Is your site or app slow to load? In &lt;b&gt;2010&lt;/b&gt; a page viewed on a computer that took 4 seconds to load would see a 30% decrease in page views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Fast forward to &lt;b&gt;2012&lt;/b&gt; and that same 4 second page load would drop your page views by 40%. Jump to 2016 and 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-154/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-speed-matters/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s &lt;b&gt;2018&lt;/b&gt;, what do you think the impact of slow-loading sites is now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, nobody has time for anything. Everyone is impatient. Attention is scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Site or app performance is table stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Aggressive tactics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are some things that websites and applications still do that have a high likelihood of triggering your users into a fit of frustration. While some tactics only become &amp;quot;aggressive&amp;quot; in a specific context, most should almost always be avoided. Here are some of the most common aggressive tactics that are likely to make users angry:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pop-ups, pop-unders, lightbox overlays, etc. &lt;/b&gt;How fast can you find and click the “X?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most egregious offender that still gets a lot of playtime is the CTA to &amp;quot;sign-up for our newsletter&amp;quot; lightbox overlay—triggered on the first visit to a site after a handful of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ads!&lt;/b&gt; In particular, the one&amp;#x27;s that take over the entire screen, mandate you watch them, auto-play sound, and on and on. Here&amp;#x27;s looking at you, Forbes!

While advertisements may be a required revenue stream and the more in-your-face the ads are, the more likely they are to be seen, clicked, and valued, there&amp;#x27;s a tenuous balance, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/technology/ad-blocking-internet.html&quot;&gt;the rise in ad-blocking software&lt;/a&gt; is a solid indicator that many advertisers and publishers are taking ads too far.

Additionally, advertisements with clickbait thumbnails or titles create cognitive load for your users, who must tease out if the &amp;quot;article&amp;quot; is real or an ad. That&amp;#x27;s not fun. Associating your brand with clickbait should likely be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opt-in boxes, automatically checked. &lt;/b&gt;Automatically being opted-in to marketing materials may increase sign-ups, but they can also infuriate your users. Tread lightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which one/where&amp;#x27;s the download button? &lt;/b&gt;While this should go without saying, attempting to trick users into clicking the wrong button sows distrust, at best. If ad placements on your site sit near critical buttons, consider how those advertisements may be used against your users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are other questionable tactics that can drive users up the wall. For a list of things that should be absolutely avoided, you&amp;#x27;ll &lt;a href=&quot;https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern&quot;&gt;find a list of other &amp;quot;dark patterns&amp;quot; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. It&amp;#x27;s broken&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your website or application isn&amp;#x27;t working, it&amp;#x27;s highly likely your users are going to notice. Granted, the site or application may not be working for lots of reasons. Here are just a couple:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;User error. &lt;/b&gt;Sometimes customers can’t seem to figure out how to use your site or app. And that’s your fault, like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bugs. &lt;/b&gt;Some part of the site is broken. Perhaps it’s a bug. Perhaps something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. It&amp;#x27;s taking too long to do [x]&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When it comes to the web, it&amp;#x27;s easy to turn a simple task into something incredibly complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is similar in nature to performance, if users feel the process to reach a certain page on your site (or point of conversion) is too slow, they will quickly become frustrated. The difference to performance is that we can design frustration into a process by making it overly complex, administrative, or tedious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Filling out forms or navigating the checkout process are two trouble areas that can rapidly turn into a bad user experience. Consider that roughly 70% of consumers will abandon their shopping cart with over 1 in 4 citing the checkout process was &amp;quot;too long/complicated&amp;quot; (via &lt;a href=&quot;https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate&quot;&gt;baymard.com&lt;/a&gt; 2017 research).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. I’m confused and/or I have no idea what I’m doing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ever been interacting with a site/app and felt like you should be able to do something obvious but you cannot figure out how to do it? UI confusion is be a major cause of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most users will just leave with only a select few making it over to the Help documents. An even smaller number will actually reach out for support..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;7. My device is broken and/or my internet connection stinks, etc.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We&amp;#x27;ve all been there—a slow (or missing) Internet connection, a lagging, uncooperative device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The kicker about this one is that it doesn&amp;#x27;t even have to be your site&amp;#x27;s fault for your site (or app) to take the blame. What can you even do about this one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;One solution, though not an easy one, is to prepare the responsive design of your site for users who might have poor Internet connections. Google, for example, encourages employees to test out their products over slower Internet speeds by mimicking 3G (and other) connection speeds as options across the Google corporate Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are only imperfect solutions, if any, for this one. You may need to get creative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Frustration detection—indirect vs. direct&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Today, online businesses rely on two broad means for gauging customer sentiment, whether positive or negative (frustration or engagement). These two methods can be categorized as direct or indirect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Direct methods to measure user frustration on the web&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Direct methods of gauging frustration require user participation. “Tell us your dissatisfaction.” Tools like surveys, support tickets, contact forms, social media monitoring, etc. all function as a “direct” read on the customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are &lt;b&gt;three major problems with direct methods of frustration measurement&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. They require the customer to do the hard work&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That “work” is jumping through hoops—e.g. filling out contact forms, using chat support, placing phone calls, going on social media rants, whatever, to express frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This process selects for customers who are willing to go through the hassle, which is very likely a lower number of individuals than the total set of frustrated customers. The result is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/quantitative-data/&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; that is going to be slanted to a certain level of frustration. It very likely will miss low-level frustrations—the kind of things that customers will grumble through and not report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. They assume a customer can articulate their frustration&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Have you ever been in a bad mood but you weren’t exactly sure why? Online experiences need not be in-your-face frustrating for them to be dissatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many times it takes a number of events in combination to create a frustrating experience—the kind of bad experience that drives a customer to respond to a survey and provide critical feedback. The problem here is that the content of the feedback may not articulate what exactly went wrong. The customer may only report the last straw, the first, or maybe some part in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. They can bias results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Hawthorne Effect is a real problem when it comes to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/combating-bias-in-user-testing&quot;&gt;polling users on their experience&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not familiar, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect&quot;&gt;Hawthorne Effect&lt;/a&gt; is “a type of reactivity in which individuals modify an aspect of their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Directly asking customers about their experience can be fruitful; however, it’s important to recognize its limitations. And the greatest limitation of directly asking customers about their experience is that the respondents will always be a limited set of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Indirect methods to measure user frustration on the web&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Indirect methods for measuring online experiences show a great deal of promise when it comes to understanding customer frustration. However, the metrics most often used to track frustration—metrics such as elevated bounce rates off a given page, average time on page, changes in conversion rates, etc.—have been blunt instruments and limited in their usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Consider &lt;i&gt;bounce rate&lt;/i&gt;. Assuming the web page or app being measured isn’t a single-page app, bounce rate can only tell you if a customer hit a page and then left your site. Whether a given bounce is a sign of frustration is difficult to know with any certainty. Similar problems exist with metrics like average time on page, conversion rate changes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Giving a voice to unspoken frustration&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we assume the customer’s default reaction to having a bad experience online is—at best—to say nothing. At worst, they report their bad experience, but not to you—to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For most, bad experiences are never shared anywhere, and the result is a gap between the real and the reported online experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory is helping teams bridge that gap through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt; and search technology. The &lt;i&gt;Frustration Guide&lt;/i&gt; serves to help you understand these tools so that you can reduce user struggle online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The future of frustration detection is indirect&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While indirect methods for measuring customer frustration online have been historically limited, advances in technology have created new ways to measure and understand the online customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That&amp;#x27;s where &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;session replay&lt;/a&gt; comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Replay is expanding what’s possible when it comes to understanding the customer experience online. How? Session replay records all user interactions on a web site or app for the purpose of creating high-fidelity recordings that can be re-watched and understood at a later date. This video-like reproduction is known as session replay or session playback. (For a more in-depth discussion of session replay, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/#what-is-session-replay&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;what is session replay in the definitive guide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session replay is useful for providing context for user frustration received directly through feedback. For example, you can connect a given user’s feedback to their specific session, so if a customer has a problem, you can watch their session and see just what was going wrong. Unfortunately, only a subset of users will provide direct feedback about frustrating experiences and many frustrating experiences will go undetected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thankfully, advancements made possible through recording sessions are helping identify struggles through machine intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How does this work? Recording sessions results in an abundance of customer experience data. In order to make that data accessible, FullStory indexes this data so it can be searched—e.g. search your sessions for CSS selectors, URLs, user attributes, and hundreds of other indexed events (Get acquainted with FullStory OmniSearch &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828253&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;And when it comes to customer frustration, FullStory also indexes &lt;b&gt;user behaviors that correlate to negative, frustrating online experiences&lt;/b&gt;, making those events searchable to developers, designers, customer support, and other teams. Once these sessions are identified, they can be researched in-depth using session replay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Frustration signals captured in session replay&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What online behaviors signal user frustration? While yelling, keyboard pounding, mouse slamming, exasperated muttering, and making obscene gestures at the computer screen (or mobile device) are all clear signs of frustration, they&amp;#x27;re not capable of being captured in session replay. However, frustration can be signaled to FullStory through on-screen behaviors—things like excessive clicking on specific elements or mouse thrashing, to name only two examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mining session replay data for signals of customer frustration is the frontier for customer experience analytics and signals are still being researched and tested. FullStory indexes five types of customer frustration signals, including Rage Clicks, Dead Clicks, Error Clicks, Form Abandonment, and Thrashing mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What are Rage Clicks?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rage Clicks occur when users rapid-fire click (or tap) on your site or app. Rage clicking is the digital equivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201205/hell-yes-the-7-best-reasons-swearing&quot;&gt;cursing to release frustration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As a frustration event, Rage Clicks were first introduced by FullStory in 2015 and have become an important way to identify frustrating sessions on websites and apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are all kinds of web elements that can induce Rage Clicks, from graphics to text. Rage Clicks are often the result of a mismatch between user expectations and reality—perhaps users believe clicking should trigger something specific to happen but nothing does, so they click some more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, you can induce Rage Clicks by putting a screenshot of a Youtube video, complete with the triangle play button. Users will begin clicking away on “Play” but when nothing happens (it&amp;#x27;s just a screenshot!), frustration will result. Video can also induce rage clicking when it just doesn&amp;#x27;t load fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The set of possible rage click-inducing web elements is only limited by the imagination of web developers. Critically, it&amp;#x27;s not easy to predict what might cause a Rage Click, which is why searching your user sessions in FullStory for Rage Click events is so useful—you&amp;#x27;ll make unexpected discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Perhaps some innocuous copy is confusing (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;Rage Click Examples and Actions&lt;/a&gt;) or users have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/&quot;&gt;Job-to-Be-Done&lt;/a&gt; and they simply can&amp;#x27;t do it (See: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-and-jobs-to-be-done-reveal-the-hidden-desire-paths-in-your-product/&quot;&gt;From Rage Clicks to Product Improvements&lt;/a&gt;). You just don&amp;#x27;t know, which is why searching for these frustration signals can provide a treasure trove of UX improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Rage Clicks captured in session replay&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Below is a session recording we created using our demo site &amp;quot;Fruitshoppe.&amp;quot; In it, you can see how Rage Clicks are captured in FullStory. Look for the click click clicking that occurs around 0:48 as the user Rage Clicks on the Purchase button (Notice also the Rage Clicks get the double whammy of creating a JavaScript Error in the console):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» How FullStory users put Rage Clicks to work&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How are FullStory users making use of Rage Clicks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpanishDict&lt;/b&gt; found users Rage Clicking on verb conjugations.

You can either research these moments to determine if they are opportunities to improve your product (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-and-jobs-to-be-done-reveal-the-hidden-desire-paths-in-your-product/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Rage Clicks to Product Improvements&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: how Rage Clicks reveal user desires for unsatisfied &amp;quot;Jobs-to-Be Done&amp;quot;) or refine your Rage Click results using FullStory&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;ignore&amp;quot; capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Find Rage Click sessions in FullStory&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You’ll find a few ways to find sessions that contain Rage Clicks in FullStory. Because Rage Clicks are such a useful, clear signal for online frustration, they are discoverable at the top-level of the FullStory app. If you&amp;#x27;re logged in, you can use the lefthand sidebar navigation to narrow all your sessions to those that contain Rage Clicks by clicking on “Rage clicked recently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Alternatively, you can find Rage Click sessions by searching in FullStory. In this case, just navigate to the OmniSearch bar and start typing “Rage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In both of these cases, the session list result will be exactly the same. Importantly, you can further refine your Rage Click results based on whatever other criteria you require — e.g. by user filters or other events (More: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;Replay what matters using FullStory Search Event and User Filters&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Top Rage Clicks&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You may have hundreds or even thousands of sessions that contain Rage Clicks. How do you find the most common elements that create Rage Clicks? When logged into FullStory, scroll below your list of sessions to the graphic visualizations. There you’ll find the Top Rage Clicks card, which has a list of the top 10 elements that received Rage Clicks. You can click any item in the list and create a list of sessions that contain Rage Clicks on that element. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/content/images/2017/10/ezgif-4-97c0e995c2.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Use the &amp;quot;Top Rage Clicks&amp;quot; list to prioritize which elements should be fixed first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;☞ More Rage Click resources&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We&amp;#x27;ve written extensively about Rage Clicks and if rapid-fire clicks are a focus for your research, you should take a read through these additional resources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-turn-analytics-into-actionable-insights/&quot;&gt;Rage Click Examples and Actions&lt;/a&gt; Examples of what can drive Rage Clicks as well as a case study from a FullStory customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-and-jobs-to-be-done-reveal-the-hidden-desire-paths-in-your-product/&quot;&gt;From Rage Clicks to Product Improvements&lt;/a&gt;.

While Dead Clicks share some similarities to Rage Clicks, they do not require rapid-fire, back-to-back clicks to trigger FullStory’s frustration detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unlike Rage Clicks, the behavioral signal associated with Dead Clicks can be nuanced and subtle, which is why watching sessions that contain Dead Clicks is required to tease out theories as to what might be driving the behavior. Similar to Rage Clicks but to a greater degree, there is a chance that a Dead Click is not out of frustration—a false positive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, users may be clicking the “background” of a web page in order to escape an overlay or assure focus is on the page. In other cases we see instances when Dead Clicks happen on paragraphs of text, which may signal focused attention by the user as they struggle to internalize a challenging concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Dead Clicks are useful for teasing out these nuanced behaviors. Investigating them in FullStory can result in discovering opportunities to help users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Find Dead Click sessions in FullStory&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can find sessions that contain Dead Clicks by hopping up into the FullStory OmniSearch bar and typing “dead,” which will auto-complete the option to search for “Dead clicked anything.” Alternatively, you can click into the OmniSearch bar and mouse down to “FRICTION” and then click “Dead clicks.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/content/images/2017/10/dead-clicks-search.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The result will be a search for all user sessions that include “Dead clicks.” Like any search in FullStory, the Dead Clicks attribute can be combined with other search criteria to narrow your search to whatever you find most relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Dead Clicks in Page Insights&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you have FullStory’s Page Insights pack, you have an additional way to surface Dead Clicks through Click Maps. This visual can be particularly useful for understanding where aggregated users are “Dead Clicking” on a given page on your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using Page Insights with Click Maps to look at Dead Clicks is helpful by providing a visual of where users click most—with no effect on the page. Dead clicks are fascinating as they can hint at mismatches in expectations, confusion or enhanced focus, and many other reasons that can only be understood through replaying sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Top Dead Clicks&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Like Rage Clicks, when you’re logged into FullStory, you can scroll below your list of sessions to find the list of your most-Dead Clicked elements. Each item on this list can be searched on in FullStory, which can be helpful in surfacing a functional sample of sessions to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What are Error Clicks?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When a user click triggers a client-side JavaScript error, FullStory takes note, indexing these events as “Error Clicks.” Error Clicks may or may not result in a user noticing something is breaking with the web site or app. Watching sessions that contain Error Clicks enables developers to understand the conditions that produced the JavaScript errors in order to diagnose and solve bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your users have capacity to put your app or site through the ringer, creating problems you never could have anticipated. By searching sessions for Error Clicks, you can make sure that all that “work” isn’t wasted, using session replay to reproduce bugs on-the-fly. Beyond bug reproduction, it goes without saying that Error Clicks are likely to be noticed by users, creating frustrating online experiences. Researching Error Click sessions should be a top priority for improving the online experience on your site or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Find Error Click sessions in FullStory&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Just like Rage and Dead Clicks, it’s easy to find sessions that contain Error Clicks. Simply fire up FullStory and start typing “error” in the OmniSearch bar and click on “Error clicked anything.” Alternatively, click on the OmniSearch bar and mouse down to “FRICTION” and click on “Error clicks.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/content/images/2017/10/dead-clicks-search.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Top Error Clicks&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As with Rage and Dead Clicks, when you’re logged into FullStory, you can scroll below your list of sessions to find the list of your most-Error Clicked elements. This list can focus your efforts to fixing the most widespread errors first. Each item on this list can be searched on in FullStory, which can be helpful in surfacing a functional sample of sessions to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is Thrashed Cursor?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Thrashed Cursor—or thrashing cursor or mouse—isn’t some pun for a user so frustrated that they’re losing control of their arms while shouting expletives. Rather, Thrashed Cursor is when users erratically move their cursor back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Rapidly moving the cursor over a page can indicate the user is getting exasperated with some aspect of their experience. Perhaps the site performance is slow or they are struggling to figure something out. Thrashed Cursor is like a physical outpouring of some mental state in the user—and that state very likely could be frustration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Like all frustration signals, there is a chance of a false positive with Thrashed Cursor. E.g. perhaps the user has a broken mouse or their computer is so slow that they’re thrashing their mouse in protest. The only way to deduce if Thrashed Cursor is signalling frustration is to watch a session and make some observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Find sessions with Thrashed Cursor in FullStory&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re looking to surface Thrashed Cursor sessions, jump into FullStory and start typing “Thrashing” in the OmniSearch box. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Applying the “Thrashed Cursor” filter to a segment of sessions—e.g. to sessions that include a visit to a specific page on your site or app—can focus research to uncovering specific problems. Alternatively, combining “Thrashed cursor” events with other frustration signals such as Rage Clicks, Dead Clicks, or Error Clicks could reveal particularly frustrating experiences—the kind that might lead you to reach out proactively to customers or identify the most odiously frustrating sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is Form Abandonment?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Raise your hand if you like filling out forms on the web? What—no takers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Forms are borderline frustrating by nature and the reason for that frustration is that data entry is friction-filled and time-consuming. Nobody has time to fill out your form—even if they want what’s on the other side of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;So it’s not surprising that many users never make it through a given form on your web site or app. For those situations, FullStory allows you to search for sessions that contain Form Abandonment. Watching sessions in which users bail on your forms can be illuminating as there may be specific fields that are tripping them up—perhaps they begin to fill out the form, get hung up on some part of it, and then jump ship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Mining your sessions for Form Abandonment has a high probability of surfacing frustration. While those experiences may never be completely eliminated, researching them through session replay is a step toward reducing friction, and that can mean more users completing your forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;» Find sessions with Form Abandoners in FullStory&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Find Form Abandoners in FullStory the same way as other frustration signals. Jump to the FullStory OmniSearch bar and start typing “form aban-” and it will auto-complete with “Abandoned any form.” From there, your search results will be filtered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you’re looking for specific forms your users are abandoning, refine your search by adding other parameters—e.g. the URL of the page that included the form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. Most frustrated sessions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While each frustration signal in FullStory can be used to research your customer&amp;#x27;s online experience on your website or app, you might find you&amp;#x27;d like to look at the set of &lt;i&gt;worst&lt;/i&gt; session recordings among the thousands of sessions captured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For that, you can use FullStory&amp;#x27;s Frustrated Sessions Card. This list of user sessions displays for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/fullstory-segments-search-save-groups-users-events-filters/&quot;&gt;any search or segment you create&lt;/a&gt; in FullStory. Simply open FullStory and look underneath the most recent session recordings for the Cards. Look for the &amp;quot;Frustrated sessions&amp;quot; card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What is a frustrated session?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Frustrated sessions are identified by deploying machine intelligence against every matching session in your Segment. Our proprietary algorithm looks for combinations of frustration signals—i.e. Rage Clicks, Error Clicks, Thrashed Cursor, etc.—contained within those sessions in order to determine which sessions contain the most customer frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s say a user gets stuck clicking a checkout button. They click &amp;quot;Checkout&amp;quot; but nothing happens. After a moment of patience, the customer proceeds to dead click around the page, clicks the button many more times, and for good measure, does some thrashing of their cursor. FullStory looks at all these behaviors together, identifying the session as containing user frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Replay any session replays from the Most Frustrated Sessions list and you&amp;#x27;ll jump right to the moments identified as frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. Turning frustration into better products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you reduce user frustration in the online experience, you can increase conversion rates, improve customer retention and reduce churn—all of which contribute to business or organizational success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Reducing frustrating experiences online starts with awareness and ends with deploying the tools necessary to find, understand, and resolve frustration through product improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To that end, product developers, engineers, marketers, designers, and more are using FullStory&amp;#x27;s frustration signals to search tens of thousands of user session recordings. Through replaying these sessions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/rage-clicks-and-jobs-to-be-done-reveal-the-hidden-desire-paths-in-your-product/&quot;&gt;teams research user intent&lt;/a&gt; to see where expectations weren&amp;#x27;t met. From there, A/B tests and experiments can be used to drive website and app improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Success during a time of ratcheting consumer expectations—competitors a quick click, search, or tap away—demands the use of new technology that can deliver the nuance necessary to understand and improve CX online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s reduce user struggle together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Start solving frustration on the web. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/demo/&quot;&gt;Get a demo&lt;/a&gt; and see FullStory in action.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The story isn&amp;#x27;t over for frustration...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory continues to research and experiment with new ways to identify frustration in online experiences captured through session recordings.

Almost one-third of the world’s population &lt;a href=&quot;https://review42.com/resources/smartphone-statistics/&quot;&gt;owns a smartphone&lt;/a&gt;, and 85% of Americans have one. You might have one in hand or in a pocket right now (and might even be reading this on yours).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Smartphone users will tap, swipe, and click their phone &lt;a href=&quot;https://apptitude.io/future&quot;&gt;2,617 times a day&lt;/a&gt;, and 35% of US smartphone users check their phones &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/survey-35-of-users-check-their-phones-more-than-50-times-per-day/&quot;&gt;more than 50 times a day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While the sheer number of mobile experiences have grown, the &lt;i&gt;quality&lt;/i&gt; of those experiences has failed to take off. Over one-third of retail sales now come via mobile device—otherwise known as mCommerce—driving over&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/topics/1185/mobile-commerce/&quot;&gt; $47 billion&lt;/a&gt; worth of revenue in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Navigation is particularly important in retail, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marketingcharts.com/online/only-1-in-every-6-shopping-carts-turns-into-an-order-on-smartphones-72288/&quot;&gt;many users switch to desktops to complete purchases as they find the navigation easier&lt;/a&gt;. That is, if you’re lucky. Many visitors get frustrated, then leave, never to return—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-145/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/why-great-mobile-experiences-should-be-priority-marketers/&quot;&gt;61%&lt;/a&gt; of whom are likely to go to a competitor’s site instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Simply put, optimizing the mobile experience matters, now more than ever. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why the mobile experience needs DXI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
While mobile experiences are under greater scrutiny, those in charge of building and maintaining them know that categorizing mobile experiences uniformly is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There’s no single common technology; mobile experiences may involve unique operating systems, code bases, independent development teams handling Android and iOS apps, performance engineers, and cloud operations. When every engineering team has its own monitoring requirements, teams can easily end up with multiple, overlapping monitoring solutions. Simple recording technologies, which capture a video or images from a mobile session, fall short in meeting this demand for flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;That’s precisely the situation Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) seeks to help resolve.&lt;/b&gt; Done correctly, the DXI within a mobile application can unify teams by guiding product management work beyond product improvement to deliver continuous improvement of the &lt;i&gt;entire&lt;/i&gt; digital experience. This supports increased revenue through better conversion, boosts customer growth and retention, and improves organizational efficiency. It also provides teams an opportunity to observe, listen and learn directly from the end user—regardless of the device they’ve chosen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What can be learned from end users breaks down into two buckets: qualitative and quantitative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Qualitative versus quantitative: Where DXI is different&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating competitive advantage requires understanding both &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; is happening in your mobile application and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; it’s happening.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Historically, to get this information, app developers have viewed screenshots, screen recordings, and touch events of how a user interacts with an app. This information provides the developer with visibility into where users click, what they type, where they scroll, and how they navigate their app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But the data provided by these tools only shows the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As mentioned earlier, mobile applications have unique operating systems, code bases, development teams, performance engineers, cloud operations—essentially, no two are identical. Legacy visual recreation tools lose the interactions between the different technologies and teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seeing what a user does in an application is useful, but seeing how the application works to &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;power&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; that experience is invaluable. This is why DXI is the only way forward for mobile engineers and product teams.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Through DXI, the teams behind mobile applications can not only access session replay alongside qualitative and quantitative guidance—but do so in an air-tight, efficient environment. &lt;b&gt;DXI solutions do &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; use screen recording, but instead capture the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;structure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; of a native app by integrating with the platform toolkit on a deep level.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the heart of best-in-class DXI solutions are three main components: privacy, playback, and bandwidth. With these, product and engineering teams have access to more mobile analytics than ever before possible.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taking a privacy-first approach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Terms such as “session record” or “screen recording” get tossed around as synonyms. In reality, especially in the context of privacy, they’re miles apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recording everything a user sees on their device falls short on several fronts around privacy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Recording whatever is displayed on the screen can include sensitive data such as credit card numbers, addresses, or social security numbers—information that should be treated with the utmost attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Many session recording tools simply block, redact, or “grey out” video files with this sensitive information. With that method, it’s only possible to determine if private data has been accurately blocked by actually &lt;i&gt;viewing&lt;/i&gt; the recording—accessing the information intended to be stripped out in the first place, and potentially saving it in a secondary location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This recording—intentional or otherwise—of end users’ personally identifiable information (PII) without a business need leaves your business open to security breaches and leaks of that data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Recent headlines indicate the issues that weak privacy guardrails cause for businesses. In 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/iphone-session-replay-screenshots/&quot;&gt;Air Canada’s iPhone app&lt;/a&gt; failed to properly mask recorded sessions, exposing passport and credit card data and resulting in a data breach impacting 20,000 users. Other apps, including Expedia and Hotels.com, also recorded screens capturing personal details like email addresses. Additionally, regulatory frameworks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828153-FullStory-and-GDPR-Overview&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt; place stringent requirements on acceptable uses of personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Leading DXI platforms, however, completely circumvent this risk through a vector-based approach to mobile session recreation. DXI tools provide a privacy-first recording model, where privacy rules are evaluated on the end user&amp;#x27;s device &lt;i&gt;during&lt;/i&gt; recording. Elements of the app that are marked for exclusion (because they contain PII, for example) are &lt;i&gt;entirely excluded&lt;/i&gt;, ensuring they’re not recorded at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;DXI tools also know that privacy rules can be fluid, that applications change, and that users need to update settings. Accordingly, it’s best practice to change mobile app recording rules from within web apps, allowing users to update rules without needing to ship a new release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Essentially, DXI affords privacy by default, not privacy as an add-on.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This sets users up for success—and stymies issues &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; they occur—by capturing only the &lt;i&gt;structure&lt;/i&gt; of the app without any user data from the outset. This way, users can unmask just the elements that provide value without auditing the entire app for sensitive fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Inherently, DXI solutions are built on top of the structure of an application—instead of relying on its visuals—so additional checks for extremely sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, can be quickly introduced. This allows the tool to quickly scale with your team’s needs, unencumbered by visual shifts of an app or other mobile experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;All in all, a DXI solution should be an asset that helps you improve the quality of your app, not a liability that sets you up for bad press and potential lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Balancing performance and detail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In addition to privacy-related benefits, DXI’s vector-based approach also opens doors for addressing fidelity and performance concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the past, screen recording tools forced users down one of two paths: recording in native screen resolutions (resulting in gigantic video file sizes), or downscaling recording (resulting in choppy, low-fidelity playback). It’s been a trade-off mobile teams have had to make for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Advanced DXI tools have recognized and resolved this concern. With an SDK that ensures both optimized file size and high fidelity through the inclusion of build-time tooling for your app, modern platforms allow for the upload of static assets, such as images or fonts, ahead of time. &lt;b&gt;This direct access streamlines the recording process and ensures static assets are rendered at full fidelity during playback.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Voila—no more choosing between unwieldy or low-fidelity files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maximizing bandwidth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The outcome of a private-by-default approach is dramatically minimized risk. The outcome of high-fidelity playback is complete clarity into user activity. But why does performance matter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performance has a direct correlation to bandwidth. &lt;/b&gt;Between areas with spotty service, cell phone plans with minuscule data caps, and unreliable coffee shop Wi-Fi, slow apps that abuse bandwidth can easily cause a user to kick them to the curb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Historically, screen recording has worked by using general-purpose &lt;i&gt;video codecs, &lt;/i&gt;the compression technologies used when recording video files, to encode the screen contents into video. These operate on the output of apps’ drawing process, using the on-screen pixels as input. While these codecs provide compression of things like identical screen contents, their efficiency is fundamentally limited by only having access to what’s on the screen and without visibility into the &lt;i&gt;structure&lt;/i&gt; of the app. This reliance on the visual creates an unrealistic, unsustainable burden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Through a vector-based approach, best-in-class DXI tools instead generate a compact codec of the contents powering the session. &lt;b&gt;Instead of stitching together snapshots of an application’s output, DXI tools work at a &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;structural&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; level to provide much more advanced compression.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, it’s now possible to recognize when only the contents of one control on the screen change, as well as reuse previously recorded information about portions of the app. For example, when a user switches back to an earlier view, users of leading DXI tools can simply reference the previously reported state, isolate the change, and send only that tiny bit of data as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;This novel approach to capturing the contents of mobile applications also provides a key advantage by aligning much more closely to the way mobile apps draw themselves.&lt;/b&gt; Video codecs are designed to encode arbitrary graphical data and work on a &lt;i&gt;pixel&lt;/i&gt; level. DXI tools encode the actual drawing commands used in the application, including lines, shapes, and colors. You can think of this as the difference between using a &lt;i&gt;raster&lt;/i&gt; image format, such as .png, rather than a &lt;i&gt;vector&lt;/i&gt; image format, such as .svg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;When dealing with modern smartphones with extremely high screen resolutions, the difference in quality between the two can be staggering. Raster-based compressors also have to repeatedly compress and upload images within the application, whereas DXI’s approach can upload these in advance, saving user bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Through DXI, product and engineering teams get the quantitative and qualitative information needed to create better experiences—without bogging down the experience itself.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;The DXI expertise of FullStory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital experiences have become increasingly sophisticated, and the ability to collect information from these sessions, learn from them, and use them to perfect a user’s experience has never been more important. More than that, the way in which data is collected has escalated in complexity—desktop experiences aren’t always mirrors of the mobile experience, both behind the scenes and for what the end user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;More and more, mobile devices are &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; platform of choice. Accordingly, the technology used to measure and understand what and why mobile interactions happen should be modernized—not just stitch together pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;That’s why FullStory took a different approach. As the industry leader in Digital Experience Intelligence, FullStory believes that you should be able to drive value from your digital experience solution, in a privacy-first, high-fidelity, bandwidth-friendly way without wasting valuable developer resources on endless instrumentation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Our advanced, vector-based approach leverages the application’s existing structure to deliver flexibility and visibility without incurring the additional overhead due to app changes and app store review. FullStory for Mobile Apps is a unique solution, specifically formatted to gather the data app developers need to improve their offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/6/21048116/tech-companies-time-well-spent-mobile-phone-usage-data&quot;&gt;Top smartphone users&lt;/a&gt; spend 4 hours and 30 minutes per day on those devices—a number that’s only shooting upward.

From how we shop to how we date, how we bank to how we access healthcare, how we consume media to how we learn new skills. Yet most organizations fail to deliver a consistently beneficial digital experience. An experience that provides people with exactly what they need, at exactly the right time, with zero friction or frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Imperfect digital experiences abound. Of course, most product leaders know that this is not for lack of awareness or even for lack of effort—but because delivering a seamless digital experience is really &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It’s hard because “digital experience” is massive and multifaceted. It encompasses every digital interaction a person has with a brand, from website to app, digital ads to digital in-store experiences, email communications to push notifications, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Within an organization, individuals across functions and teams across departments own different parts of the digital experience, but rarely are these teams operating in sync. They are often siloed, disparate, pulling in multiple directions with misaligned objectives, using different tactics and strategies. The result is a disjointed, imperfect experience for the customer—and each imperfect experience is costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to PWC, one in three people walk away from a business they love after just one bad experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Each time your end-user is frustrated, confused, or inhibited when interacting with your brand, they lose patience. Whatever loyalty they had evaporates. This translates to long-term impact on your bottom-line. According to PWC, one in three people walk away from a business they love after just one bad experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;On the bright side, it works in reverse, too. A great experience served at the right time can strengthen your connection to your customers in a big way and help you differentiate from your competitors—who are only a click away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;That’s where a digital experience analytics platform comes into play.&lt;/b&gt; The right platform combined with the right strategy will allow you to confidently manage and improve your digital experience. It should help you reduce operating costs, optimize experiences and boost conversions, and ultimately increase customer happiness and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But how do you select the right platform for your business? You start by defining your biggest digital experience challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Gartner, by 2024, 80% of IT organizations will undergo radical restructuring and changes to their missions as they embrace product-centric operating models. How can you stay ahead? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/prepare-now-for-the-future-of-digital-product-management-a-gartner-report&quot;&gt;Download the Gartner report: Prepare Now for the Future of Digital Product Management&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What problems are you trying to solve with a digital experience platform?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;First things first. When evaluating a digital experience platform, you should focus on the organizational challenge(s) you are trying to solve. Clear problem definition will allow you to zoom in on the capabilities and features that are most important to achieving success with a DXI platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The most common challenges we hear from customers and prospects can be traced back to two primary causes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of visibility into the customer’s digital experience (aka The Problem of the Unknown), and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An inability to move quickly due to internal barriers (aka The Problem of Time-to-Value)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Problem of the Unknown might sound like...&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We don’t have enough visibility into where and why our users are experiencing friction and getting frustrated.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We don’t know how user frustration is impacting conversions and overall customer happiness.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We are receiving complaints about poor experience from customers via support or social media, but struggle to replicate the issues.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We aren’t sure how changes to our website or app are impacting key funnel metrics.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We feel like we’re missing opportunities to up-sell and cross-sell, but we aren’t sure where they are.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We hear that our site or app is difficult to use, but struggle to prioritize the most impactful UX adjustments.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Problem of Time-to-Value might sound like...&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Our organization is siloed and we struggle to communicate and make improvements quickly.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Different teams look at different sources of data, which makes it difficult to all get on the same page.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We struggle to create consensus across leadership around where to invest resources to improve the digital experience.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“It’s difficult for our engineers to prioritize between fixing bugs and developing new feature functionality.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We’ve been using a DXI solution for months now, but can’t point to a single improvement we’ve made as a result.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Once we ship an experience, we move on. We don’t have a way to quickly iterate and improve.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Our competitors are setting the standard for digital experience and we are worried we aren’t keeping up.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While no digital experience platform is a silver bullet on its own, the right platform wielded in a strategic way should help you resolve your most pressing challenges—including the challenges listed above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the next section, we outline 11 factors to consider when you are evaluating a digital experience platform. Depending on your organization’s most pressing issues and objectives, you will want to prioritize certain capabilities over others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If at any point while reading this guide you have questions, don&amp;#x27;t hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/contact/&quot;&gt;reach out to our team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Solving the Problem of the Unknown&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your most pressing problems revolve around what you &lt;i&gt;don’t know&lt;/i&gt; about your digital experience, you’ll want to select a digital experience platform that can help you eliminate blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You should select a platform that can collect every digital interaction and provide you with trustworthy, complete data so that you can answer any question you might have. Your platform should also surface actionable insights based on this data—to point you to questions you didn’t even know to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Does this platform provide a complete record of digital experience data?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If getting a complete view of how users interact with your site or app is a top priority, you should look for a digital experience platform that offers comprehensive, unsampled data ingestion. This comes down to how the platform is instrumented and its data retention capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Traditional web analytics often require that you manually tag every element that you want to track on a page so you can report on it later. If you predict users will behave one way and tag accordingly, only to discover users behave in a totally different way, you then miss out on that data. You have to stop, tag the new set of activities, and wait in order to report on what users are actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In contrast, there is a new kind of digital experience platform that leverages instrumentation-free analytics. Some of these platforms utilize &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623514-How-do-I-get-FullStory-up-and-running-on-my-site-&quot;&gt;one simple JavaScript snippet&lt;/a&gt; to index every user interaction on your site or app from day one; this ensures you don’t miss a single datapoint. With this kind of platform, any &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623274-FS-event-API-Sending-custom-event-data-into-FullStory&quot;&gt;additional instrumentation&lt;/a&gt; you do only enhances your reporting—it isn&amp;#x27;t a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these platforms utilize one simple JavaScript snippet to index every user interaction on your site or app from day one—ensuring you don’t miss a single datapoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; When evaluating a platform that claims to be &amp;quot;instrumentation-free,&amp;quot; make sure to do your homework. In order to truly benefit from this feature, you&amp;#x27;ll want to ensure all interactions are automatically captured, indexed, and made searchable without the need to continuously adjust and add to the code snippet that sits on the page. You should also understand &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624254-Security-Overview&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;how the platform secures its data&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; before adding any additional code to your site or app.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Does this platform provide quantitative data (what is happening) and qualitative data (why is it happening)?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To drive significant improvement, teams that own the digital experience need to understand both what is happening and why it is happening when it comes to user interaction with their site or app. You can’t fix what you don’t know is broken and you certainly can’t fix something if you don’t understand why it’s broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Web and product analytics provide visibility into engagement, adoption, and high-level trends but rarely illuminate why something happened. Your digital experience platform should help you deeply understand your user’s digital experience, including the root causes of any issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It should simultaneously highlight where those issues happen along the customer’s journey and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/conversions/&quot;&gt;impact of these issues on your conversion rates&lt;/a&gt;. Every insight or hypothesis should be easily tied back to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032975773-How-does-FullStory-recording-work-to-recreate-my-users-experience-&quot;&gt;actual human interaction&lt;/a&gt; that can validate and support your next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your platform should provide both &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/quantitative-data-vs-qualitative-research-analytics-work-better-together/&quot;&gt;quantitative data and qualitative data&lt;/a&gt; so that you can quickly understand and prioritize improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Does this platform proactively find and surface user frustration insights?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A complete record of user interaction data is essential to make well-informed DXI decisions. However, a data lake of that magnitude can be overwhelming if you don’t have a team of analysts extracting and delivering insights. Ideally, your digital experience platform can help you surface actionable insights regardless of organizational resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For example, your platform should enable your business intelligence team to extract and analyze all of your digital experience data in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020829273-What-is-Data-Export-&quot;&gt;completely customized way&lt;/a&gt;. Or, if analyst resources are limited, your platform should be able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://go2.fullstory.com/rs/002-LDF-436/images/Conversions%20One%20Pager.pdf&quot;&gt;automatically surface your most important opportunities for improvement&lt;/a&gt;, ranked by potential business impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Many digital experience solutions will proactively surface insights, but you’ll want to understand as much as possible about how these recommendations are being made. For example, is there &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034656073-Conversions-Digging-into-your-results&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;transparency around the formulas used&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;? Can you validate these recommendations with individual user session replays? Proactive insights can be extremely helpful, pointing you to problems you didn’t know existed. But you should have total confidence in the science behind the recommendations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Does this platform support mobile apps?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your organization has a mobile app, you will want to select a digital experience platform that can be deployed on mobile apps. Because your user is in a different context when they are using their mobile device, you can’t always apply insights from your website experience to your mobile experience. In fact, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/clayton-christensen-jobs-to-be-done-framework-product-development/&quot;&gt;jobs your user is trying to accomplish&lt;/a&gt; are often completely different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;With the ever-growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.fullstory.com/mobile-experience-design-for-the-people/&quot;&gt;importance of the mobile experience&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll want a DXI platform that allows you to collect and analyze data about mobile user interactions &lt;i&gt;specifically&lt;/i&gt;—data that is as accurate and high-fidelity as what you’re gathering from your web experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Solving the Problem of Time-to-Value&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;More and more, we’re seeing that digital success is linked to organizational agility. To an organization’s ability to identify and fix bugs and UX issues fast. To its ability to efficiently prioritize, develop, and deploy new products and features that add value to customers’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;These organizations move with agility because they are able to reduce or eliminate the impact of internal silos. The right digital experience platform can be a huge asset here—fostering better cross-team communication and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Is this platform easy to implement and maintain?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If speed is an issue, the last thing you’ll want to do is select a digital experience platform that takes weeks, months, or even years to implement. Many platforms on the market require considerable event instrumentation up front as well as continuous maintenance. This can be a time consuming and labor intensive process because you have to manually tag certain elements in the codebase during onboarding and with every deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your goal is to get up and running quickly and reduce time to actionable insights, you’ll want a platform that takes days (not weeks) to implement and that can automatically collect, organize, and store all of your digital experience data without continuous event instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your organization may already have custom events that you’ve instrumented using a Customer Data Platform, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828993-Segment&quot;&gt;Segment&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020829093-Tealium-&quot;&gt;Tealium&lt;/a&gt;. Because custom events can add additional context to your digital experience data, the DX platform you select should be able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623274-FS-event-API-Sending-custom-event-data-into-FullStory&quot;&gt;easily ingest these events&lt;/a&gt;. Custom event tagging should always be an option—but never a necessity—to gain insight into every customer journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Is this platform accessible and usable for both technical and non-technical teams?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;In most organizations, multiple teams are responsible for the customer’s digital experience: product, IT, engineering, customer support, UX design, etc. If your organization has a business intelligence team responsible for generating actionable reports and surfacing department-specific insights, you may be less concerned with platform accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to pivot and act quickly is often a result of individual teams having access to the information they need when they need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;However, it is becoming clear that the more agile an organization is, the better. According to data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-agility-pays&quot;&gt;McKinsey&lt;/a&gt;, agile companies are far more likely to display high overall organizational health than their slower counterparts. This ability to pivot and act quickly is often a result of individual teams having access to the information they need when they need it. If increased agility is a goal, you should source a DX platform that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828273-Getting-Started-with-FullStory&quot;&gt;easy to use&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828253-Getting-Acquainted-with-OmniSearch&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020622754-Can-I-save-searches-that-I-use-frequently-create-a-segment-&quot;&gt;customize&lt;/a&gt; for technical and non-technical teams alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Does this platform surface insights that are relevant at every level in the organization?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If your organization is plagued by internal debate when it comes to prioritizing digital experience improvements, you’ll want to source a platform that can translate insights to a variety of audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A product manager may want to understand the factors that most strongly correlate with dropout in a specific funnel. A VP of Ecommerce, on the other hand, is looking for holistic insight into the digital experience so they can strategically understand and improve the experiences that matter the most. One will need a more granular view of user interaction data, the other will need a high-level, aggregate view of the entire digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ideally, you can source a digital experience platform that acts as a common source of insights for individuals and teams at every level in the organization, reducing back-and-forth and ensuring your organization can quickly align on its most important opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How will this platform enrich my existing technology stack?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Extensibility is a critical consideration when you are shopping for a digital experience platform. Your DXI platform should &lt;a href=&quot;https://partners.fullstory.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;integrate seamlessly&lt;/a&gt; with your existing stack and provide data and insights where your teams already spend their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You should consider whether the platform you’re evaluating has:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.fullstory.com/introduction&quot;&gt;Robust APIs&lt;/a&gt; that empower developers to enrich their tech stack with platform data and deepen the insights they receive within the platform itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045134554-Webhooks&quot;&gt;Webhooks&lt;/a&gt; to power workflows across the business and allow you to set up automations and take action in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://partners.fullstory.com/integrations/&quot;&gt;ecosystem of integrations&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to connect your tech stack and create a shared language around digital experience across your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;To facilitate cross-team alignment and efficient collaboration, you’ll want a DXI platform that can act as a single source of truth. Any user should be able to find the information they’re looking for within the DXI platform. They should also be able to access digital experience data in the platforms where they already spend their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;For instance, if your support team spends their time in a support ticketing platform like &lt;a href=&quot;https://partners.fullstory.com/integrations/solution/793/zendesk&quot;&gt;Zendesk&lt;/a&gt;, can they access digital experience data within that system? Can they quickly share that data to your engineering team with all the necessary context?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A well-integrated DXI platform will amplify your entire tech stack with digital experience data, providing a common language for disparate teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How will this platform enable efficient iteration and optimization?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most digital leaders know that there is &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; more to improve when it comes to digital experience. Customer expectations and needs are constantly changing, which means you should be continuously iterating your digital experience. It isn’t enough to source a DX platform that can help you ship an improvement—because even if you understand the issue, you can’t always be sure that your solution is the right solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;That’s where experimentation comes in. You need a DXI platform that can quickly point you to the most impactful opportunities for experimentation as well as help you pinpoint why a particular variant performed better than another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Building an optimal digital experience isn’t a one-and-done. You have to iterate continuously to meet ever-changing customer needs, which is why experimentation is critical to your business. You no longer have to guess what your customer wants, and your digital experience platform should surface powerful insights into how users interact with your website or app. It should also &lt;a href=&quot;https://partners.fullstory.com/integrations/solution/790/optimizely&quot;&gt;easily integrate&lt;/a&gt; with your experimentation platform to fuel smarter experiments that drive stronger results to delight customers.&amp;quot;

— Glenn Griffin, VP Global Partnerships and Channels at Optimizely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Two final key considerations: Platform performance and responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ultimately, you are shopping for a DXI platform because your goal is to optimize your customer’s digital experience. You&amp;#x27;ll want to ensure that any platform you implement will have minimal negative impact on that experience—both in terms of performance impact and also in the greater context of end-user responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How will this platform impact the perceived performance of my site or app?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Performance should always be a part of the conversation when you are evaluating a new software—particularly page load time. It’s a known fact that slow site load time correlates with user abandonment. You don’t want to bring on a platform to help you improve the digital experience only to find it slows down your digital experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ask your vendors to walk you through how their platform is instrumented and &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043998774-FullStory-and-Google-Lighthouse&quot;&gt;how that instrumentation impacts the perceived performance&lt;/a&gt; of your site or app for end-users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This consideration is particularly important when you are &lt;a href=&quot;https://bionic.fullstory.com/private-by-default-mobile-analytics/&quot;&gt;evaluating platforms for your mobile app&lt;/a&gt;. Legacy practices for gathering digital experience data on mobile involve literally hijacking a user’s device to take a screenshot of the application every few frames. This is extremely resource intensive. Not only does it place the burden of gathering performance data on the customer&amp;#x27;s device (using their battery, data, and bandwidth) but it directly impacts how much energy the device has to run the app, resulting in a frustratingly slow, disjointed user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How does the platform vendor view responsibility—including end-user privacy, data security, and compliance?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/responsibility/&quot;&gt;Responsibility&lt;/a&gt; should be a factor when you are evaluating any kind of data platform: What is the company’s stance on protecting end-user privacy? How do they ensure the data they do collect is secure? How do they adhere to existing legislation? What do they view as their ethical responsibility?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As you evaluate digital experience platforms, look closely at
their policies on end-user &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044349073-FullStory-Private-by-Default&quot;&gt;privacy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624254-Security-Overview&quot;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt;, and compliance with legislation such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/ccpa-and-fullstory-guide/&quot;&gt;CCPA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/gdpr-and-fullstory/&quot;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Choosing the right digital experience analytics platform for your business&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Digital channels will continue to become more and more important for most organizations. It is critical that companies prioritize the digital experience—each suboptimal experience is costing your business in lost conversions and eroded customer loyalty. And it’s a missed opportunity to strengthen customer happiness and connection with your brand!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The right digital experience platform will help you streamline your efforts around digital experience management and improvement. Use the factors outlined above to zoom in on the capabilities that are most important to your organization. Once you’ve selected the perfect platform, you can hit the ground running, differentiating yourself from competitors through experience and fueling continuous growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;About FullStory&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FullStory provides a new way to understand and improve your digital experience.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory’s Digital Experience Intelligence platform enables businesses to continuously improve their digital customer experience across websites, web apps, and mobile apps.

You should work closely with legal and other professional counsel to determine exactly how the CCPA may or may not apply to you and your company. In some places we will cite specific sections of the CCPA for your reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this article:&lt;/b&gt; If you’ve landed here, you’ve likely already heard lots about the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). There is already a lot of other great content that explains in detail &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ntsc.org/resources/ntsc-blog/the-clock-is-ticking-ccpa-101-and-how-to-comply-before-january-2020.html&quot;&gt;what the CCPA is&lt;/a&gt;. Here, we’ll mostly focus on the CCPA’s impact on your business and how it relates to your use of FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;1. What is the CCPA?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;California Assembly Bill (AB) 375, also known as The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown in June 2018 and went into effect January 1, 2020. Officially, the goal of The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), is “to further Californians’ right to privacy by giving consumers an effective way to control their personal information.” The act outlines five new rights protecting California consumers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;amp;part=4.&amp;amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;amp;title=1.81.5&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;See CCPA Sections 1798.100-125&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right of Californians to know what personal information is being collected about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right of Californians to know whether their personal information is sold or disclosed and to whom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right of Californians to say no to the sale of personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right of Californians to access (or request deletion of) their personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right of Californians to equal service and price, even if they exercise their privacy rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;2. Does the CCPA apply to your business?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Since the CCPA was enacted to protect the privacy rights of consumers in California, you may be wondering how this will affect you and your business (especially if you aren’t located in California). When determining how &lt;b&gt;your business&lt;/b&gt; might be impacted by the CCPA, there are a few things you might want to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCPA applies to companies that “do business” in California and meet &lt;b&gt;ONE &lt;/b&gt;or more of these minimum thresholds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has annual gross revenues in excess of 25 million dollars ($25,000,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Collects” or “Sells” the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households or devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Collect” - “...buying, renting, gathering, obtaining, receiving, or accessing any ‘personal information’ pertaining to a consumer...actively or passively, or by observing the consumer’s behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sell” - “...selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating...a consumer’s personal information...for monetary or other valuable consideration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derives 50% or more of its annual revenues from selling consumers’ personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCPA does not apply when the collection or sale of personal information occurs “wholly outside of California” (See Section 1798.145 (a)(6)).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A covered “business”, as defined by the CCPA, may require its “service provider” to comply with the CCPA if the business shares personal information with the “service provider.” A “service provider” is defined as legal entity that processes information on behalf of a business and to which the business discloses a consumer’s personal information for a business purpose pursuant to a written contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is ‘valuable consideration’? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;While “valuable consideration” is not defined in the CCPA, the concept of “consideration” is defined in the California Civil Code (&lt;a href=&quot;https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2010/civ/1605-1615.html&quot;&gt;§ 1605&lt;/a&gt;) and is a well understood concept of California contract law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Basically, “valuable consideration” can be taken to mean that if your business exchanges end-user personal information for a business benefit, then you are likely “selling” personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;3. What does the CCPA require of your business?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Most of what the CCPA mandates is related to being upfront and transparent with consumers about data collection practices. While best practices around operationalizing the CCPA are subject to change in the short term, there are a few key concepts that are clearly important for you to keep in mind when considering how the CCPA relates to your business’ use of personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a clear understanding of what constitutes “personal information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update privacy policies to include descriptions of data collection practices and a summary of consumer’s rights under the CCPA. For businesses that sell or otherwise disclose (see above for a definition of “sell”) personal information for a “business practice”:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The privacy policy must disclose this fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The privacy policy must also contain a link to an “opt-out” page where a consumer can choose for their personal information to not be sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respond to verified consumer requests for information disclosure or deletion within the appropriate window of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What does the CCPA consider “personal information?”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The definition of personal information included within the CCPA is quite expansive. The CCPA states that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The law includes many examples of things that can be considered personal information. These range from where a person lives, geolocation information, social network information, and biometric information. Familiarizing yourself with how the concept of “personal information” applies to your business should be an important consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This only begins to scratch the surface of a very complex topic, but there are more detailed breakdowns of the CCPA’s concept of “personal information” available elsewhere on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;As a reminder, the FullStory &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/legal/acceptable-use/&quot;&gt;Acceptable Use Policy&lt;/a&gt; already prohibits transmitting sensitive personal information such as social security numbers, health information, etc., to FullStory. We have worked hard to provide &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623574&quot;&gt;easy-to-use tools&lt;/a&gt; that allow you to ensure these kinds of sensitive information never leave the end-user’s browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;We will discuss more about how the CCPA’s requirements and the concept of “personal information” relates to FullStory and session replay below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;4. How does the CCPA affect your business and FullStory?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It is natural to wonder how the CCPA might affect the relationship your company has with FullStory—or the relationship we both have with your end-users. The good news is that things haven’t really changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If you are a Customer (“business” under the CCPA) using FullStory, then you can consider FullStory a “service provider” under the CCPA. As a service provider FullStory will process personal information for business purposes on your behalf. FullStory will not sell, retain, use, or disclose any personal information except as necessary to perform our agreed upon business purpose. Pretty much business as usual!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But what about end-users … do I need permission from them to keep using FullStory?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;The CCPA requires companies to disclose their practices of information collection and sale in their privacy policies. Businesses are required to provide consumers an opt-out for the sale of personal information but are not required to offer a similar opt-out for information &lt;i&gt;collection&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;FullStory’s Terms &amp;amp; Conditions require our Customers to have obtained all consents and approvals necessary in order to use the data collected by FullStory and that they do not and will not violate any law or regulation applicable to them. For more information on this topic please reference &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020622934-Do-I-need-to-inform-my-users-that-their-sessions-are-being-recorded-&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; or see section 11.1 of FullStory’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/&quot;&gt;Terms &amp;amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt;. And remember, you cannot sell or exchange any information obtained by using FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, you may run into situations where obtaining more specific, explicit end-user consent makes sense for your digital property. In these cases, the &lt;code&gt;FS.consent&lt;/code&gt; API allows you to selectively record parts of your site or app based on explicit end-user consent. For more information regarding use of the FS.consent API in your deployment of FullStory please check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623254-FS-consent-Recording-elements-with-consent&quot;&gt;this knowledge base article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;5. FullStory data collection and the CCPA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;At FullStory, we want to empower you and your company to create more perfect digital experiences for your customers. In order to accomplish this, FullStory stores and organizes a lot of data on your behalf. To better understand where FullStory and the CCPA intersect, you need to know what kinds of information FullStory collects, what we do with it, and how that information is visible in the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What types of data does FullStory collect?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory makes a detailed accounting of every action that takes place on your site or app. From mouse movements and clicks to screen swipes or typing, we store and organize as much as you tell us to! We also store copies of page assets such as images, text, CSS, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It is important that any elements in your digital property that can potentially contain sensitive data are properly excluded from collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;It is also possible to pass information into FullStory that was obtained elsewhere. We will discuss this in more detail in a later section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;What does FullStory do with the data we store on your behalf?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory allows you to get at both qualitative and quantitative insights from a single set of data. To do this, we use digital experience data to generate charts and graphs, create heatmap visualizations, and render pixel-perfect session replays. In addition, we make all of the raw event data available via data export (JSON format) for you to slice and dice using the data visualization tool of your choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Where is personal information visible in the FullStory platform?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are basically two places in the FullStory platform where it would be possible to view collected personal information. These two places are Session Replay and Data Export.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Session Replay&lt;/b&gt;: Session replay is the reproduction of a user’s interactions on a website or web application exactly or as close as possible to how the user actually experienced it. In order for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;any session replay tool&lt;/a&gt; to work, session replay vendors (like FullStory!) must store users’ digital interactions on websites and apps down to the individual clicks, taps, scrolls, mouse movements, etc. By reproducing these interactions, just how they happened, the result is a DVR-like reproduction of those experiences, just how they happened (Learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/the-definitive-guide-to-session-replay/&quot;&gt;how session replay works in our definitive guide&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replay is useful for all sorts of reasons—e.g. to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/session-replay-customer-support/&quot;&gt;support customers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/debugging-with-session-replay/&quot;&gt;debug errors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullstory.com/resources/session-replay-conversion-rate-optimization/&quot;&gt;optimize pages&lt;/a&gt;, and more—and offers a totally different level of insight than traditional analytics alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data Export&lt;/b&gt;: FullStory’s Data Export provides a periodic, raw data extract of events that have been recorded for your organization and an &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624194&quot;&gt;API endpoint&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the data extracts. This data set can be used on its own or to supplement existing models that aim to analyze user interactions on a website or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Although personal information can be visible in both session replay and data export, data export only contains a subset of the information potentially visible in session replay. This is because data export contains only information related to events, like text or elements a user clicked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Session replay, on the other hand, contains the event information as well as the images and other text that make up the site or app itself. Because session replay has the most surface area we recommend you optimize exclusions with session replay in mind. Doing so should result in a clean data export as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory and personal information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How do FullStory and the collection of personal information intersect? Just because something is considered personal information, doesn’t mean you cannot collect it or pass that information to FullStory. There are valid business reasons why a company would know a person’s name or email address, for example, and why having that information in FullStory might make sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Your business must determine what kinds of personal information to collect for valid business purposes. Based on these determinations, your business must inform consumers appropriately through your privacy policy and/or terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now, there are two main ways personal information can make its way into FullStory:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first way personal information can make its way into FullStory is through the collection of non-excluded text content in a website or app. This text may be either part of the site, or something typed into a field by an end-user. Either way, this collected text would be visible in a session replay. It is up to you, the FullStory customer, to ensure any page elements or fields that contain sensitive personal information are properly excluded. We have provided the tools necessary for you to accomplish this and you can read more about that process &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623574&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second way that personal information can end up in FullStory is that you can actively send user data like name, email address, company, etc. to FullStory using one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828113&quot;&gt;our APIs&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;FS.identify&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;FS.setUserVars&lt;/code&gt;) or one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001589654&quot;&gt;our many integrations&lt;/a&gt;. For more information, including best practices, on passing additional end-user data into FullStory check out our help articles on &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828113-FS-identify-Identifying-users&quot;&gt;FS.identify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623294&quot;&gt;FS.setUserVars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now that you understand how personal information flows into FullStory, it is important for you to verify that sensitive information is being properly excluded from collection and that the information you are using is appropriate and necessary for improving the digital experience of your end-users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;But what about IP addresses... are they personal information?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;This is a great question because people have a whole range of differing intuitions when it comes to IP address. Unfortunately, there isn’t a simple yes or no on this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Whether or not an IP address will be considered personal information may depend on what other information you have in addition to the IP address itself. Work with your legal counsel to determine how you wish to treat IP addresses in the case of your business. &lt;b&gt;If you determine IP addresses are personal information in the context of your business, it doesn’t mean you can’t still use them&lt;/b&gt;, but it likely means that if updating your privacy policy for CCPA compliance, you will want to keep this decision in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;If for some reason you decide to ditch IP addresses all together, then FullStory is here to help make that easy for you. FullStory allows you to discard all end-user IP addresses via your in app settings. &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020622834&quot;&gt;Learn how to do this here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;6. Honoring end-user personal information requests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As previously mentioned, the CCPA grants consumers the right to request that a business discloses information collected about them or to delete said information. While you will be the one working directly with your end-users to honor their requests, FullStory wants to be sure you have all the tools at your disposal to make this as frictionless as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Let’s dive into some specifics around how FullStory empowers you to comply with information requests and process user deletions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Deletion requests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;FullStory users with admin privileges can entirely &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828373&quot;&gt;erase end-users&lt;/a&gt; from their account at the click of a button. (Okay, two buttons.) The “Delete User” button is located at the bottom of a User Card in FullStory. The whole user deletion process looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;After a user is completely deleted, a discreet email is sent acting as a receipt to confirm that the appropriate action has been taken. In addition to this deletion via the FullStory UI, we also offer an &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624174&quot;&gt;API endpoint for deleting users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Personal information access requests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;California based end-users may submit personal information requests of your company at any time. It is likely that personal information about your end-users may be spread across multiple systems, but finding any personal information you may have passed into FullStory should be quite straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Using FullStory’s OmniSearch you can quickly narrow in on any information you may currently be storing related to an individual consumer or household. Using this information, you can have an informed conversation with your end-user about their data and even provide them a copy if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Like with the “Delete User” functionality that we discussed above, the buttons allowing you to “Download user events” and “Download user pages” are available at the bottom of the User Card in FullStory. The User Event download contains all the recorded event data for a particular user that is searchable/viewable in FullStory. The User Pages download file contains a series of all the pages that the end-user has visited on your site/app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020624454-Using-Download-User-Pages-and-Download-User-Events&quot;&gt;Learn more about downloading end-user data files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;FullStory will not deal directly with end-users regarding personal information requests (or user deletions). Because the data held in FullStory belongs to you/them, we will direct them to you in order to discuss these matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;7. Does FullStory offer a Data Processing Agreement (DPA)?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Yes. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=80263e03-8609-4103-9a5e-324982f1d9ea&quot;&gt;view and sign&lt;/a&gt; our DPA online or send your version to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:privacy@fullstory.com&quot;&gt;privacy@fullstory.com&lt;/a&gt; for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;8. How will I know if I&amp;#x27;m compliant with the CCPA?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;There is currently no means by which a company can be “certified” as compliant with the CCPA. We recommend that you consult your legal advisors to determine what actions you should take in order to become and remain compliant with the CCPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;As the CCPA has yet to come into effect, it is important to stay up to date with any last minute changes made to the act before that date. The California Attorney General’s office posts resources related to the CCPA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and has a CCPA newsletter you can subscribe to for updates &lt;a href=&quot;https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa/subscribe&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Another helpful resource is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iapp.org/resources/article/ccpa-amendment-tracker/&quot;&gt;CCPA amendment tracker&lt;/a&gt; maintained by the International Association of Privacy Professionals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch | How to prepare for the 2020 holiday shopping season]]></title><description><![CDATA[A product leader shares helpful tips on how to prepare your ecommerce store for the holidays.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/resources/holiday-preparation-tips-for-ecommerce</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/resources/holiday-preparation-tips-for-ecommerce</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[FullStory]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;A conversation with an ecommerce product manager on how to prepare for the holiday shopping season&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch this fireside chat with Ginny Mueller from Carvana and FullStory&amp;#x27;s Natasha Wahid for a discussion on how top brands are preparing for the anticipated (massive) uptick in online shopping this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You&amp;#x27;ll hear:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the team at Carvana readies their site for spikes in online traffic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Carvana keeps users in focus (and happy) during busy shopping times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key areas of focus for this digital-first company that you can replicate in your own business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch the webinar:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch | Building for Ms. Bennett]]></title><description><![CDATA[FullStory CEO, Scott Voigt, discusses the importance of empathy in today's digital-first world.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/resources/building-for-ms-bennett</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/resources/building-for-ms-bennett</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Natasha Wahid]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How to build better digital products by keeping your customer in focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Ms. Bennett, a mother of three with a full-time job, is mid-checkout at the grocery store when she realizes she left her wallet at home.

—Agata Bugaj, Senior Product Manager at FullStory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Agata Bugaj, Head of Product Management at FullStory, joined Melanie Crissey, Product Marketing Manager, for the last LinkedIn Live session in our Product Management series. In this episode, which aired on June 11, 2019, Agata and Melanie discuss the implications of product friction–good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Agata and Melanie discussed topics including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to identify product friction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to solve for different types of friction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When and why friction is not always bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/company/fullstory/&quot;&gt;keep up with our LinkedIn content&lt;/a&gt; by following us there or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fullstory&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch the Replay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Read the Transcript&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Hi, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us for FullStory Live. I&amp;#x27;m your host, Melanie Crissey, and we are recording live from the beautiful FullStory studio here at HQ4 in sunny, hot Atlanta, Georgia. I am thrilled to be here with Agata Bugaj. Agata is a Head of the Product Management practice here at FullStory, and just a little bit of light housekeeping to know what you&amp;#x27;re jumping into day. This is our third and final session in a series on Product Management that we&amp;#x27;ve been doing on LinkedIn live over the last couple of weeks. All of these sessions are recorded, so you can review the old ones on YouTube or on the FullStory channel, and this one will be recorded and the transcript will be up on the blog after. So if you need to duck out, have lunch, do you your thing, all of this will be available for you later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;We are live, live for real. So this only works if you give us your questions, your suggestions, your ideas, your banter, your reaction emojis, your live Tweet storm. Bring it. I&amp;#x27;ve got a great team from FullStory here that&amp;#x27;s going to help me get those questions from LinkedIn to my space phone. So our agenda is we&amp;#x27;re going to do quick introductions, we&amp;#x27;re going to talk, just discuss about the topic for the day which is friction, and then we&amp;#x27;re going to go straight to your questions that you&amp;#x27;ve sent over. So participate and we&amp;#x27;d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;So if you&amp;#x27;re just joining us, again, my name is Melanie Crissey. I am a product marketing manager here at FullStory. I was a FullStory customer for several years before joining the company about two and a half years ago. I am just really grateful to be in the room with you, Agata. Agata is a leader here. Agata, introduce yourself, tell everybody a little bit about your experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, absolutely. First of all, thanks so much for having me, Melanie. It&amp;#x27;s super fun to be here. So yes, my name&amp;#x27;s Agata, I&amp;#x27;m on the produce management team here at FullStory. I&amp;#x27;ve been at FullStory a little bit less than you. I&amp;#x27;ve been here about seven months. It&amp;#x27;s crazy how quickly time flies, but it&amp;#x27;s been-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Only seven months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;I know, it&amp;#x27;s crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;I feel like it&amp;#x27;s been so long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;I know. I know, but it&amp;#x27;s been amazing. And actually, my path to Product Management I would say was a very long and windy road, if you will. I actually started my career as a software engineer, and I loved what I was doing, but I often times found myself asking questions like why are we building this? And who is this for? And what are the goals that they&amp;#x27;re trying to achieve? And what&amp;#x27;s happening in the market?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;So I found myself doing some soul searching and I thought, you know, I really am interested in this thing called Product Management. I didn&amp;#x27;t know much about it, and so I again, took sort of a long and windy road to get into product. I went to business school, I spent some time doing consulting, and then ultimately made it to product and absolutely love it. Have been here ever since, and I actually spent ... prior to joining FullStory, spend almost six years at Home Depot working primarily on the site experience and the Product Management team, so super excited to be in product and to talk to you about friction because it&amp;#x27;s such an important topic. So, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. Yeah. Friction is super near and dear to my heart and I&amp;#x27;m actually kind of self conscious about it. I was recently accused of delivering a friction-based onboarding, and I&amp;#x27;m like processing what that it&amp;#x27;s not what I meant to do, so I&amp;#x27;m processing that. So I&amp;#x27;m really, really excited to talk about it today and kind of learn with you. So just to get grounded for anybody who&amp;#x27;s joining the call who maybe ... what is friction, so can we talk about what do we talk about when we talk about friction? Can you define it at a really high level?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, absolutely. I love what that was starting there, right? Because you have to define the thing first before you talk about it. So friction is basically any time that your customers are trying to do something, to have a goal in mind, and they&amp;#x27;re unable to achieve that goal. They&amp;#x27;re not able to do the thing that they want to do, which often times is actually we want them to do also, right? So as an example, I guess I would say take a step back, two high level buckets of friction. There&amp;#x27;s the ... we&amp;#x27;ve built something and it&amp;#x27;s not the experience that enables our customers to complete their goal. So a great example of this would be customers trying to check out and for the life of them, they just can&amp;#x27;t. They keep getting some error message, and they just cannot move forward. That&amp;#x27;s friction. That&amp;#x27;s very ... I like to call it frustration. The experience exists and it&amp;#x27;s just frustrating, something&amp;#x27;s not working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;There&amp;#x27;s another bucket of friction that&amp;#x27;s really just around opportunity identification. It&amp;#x27;s a customer is trying to do something and they&amp;#x27;re using your product in some work flow, and the product just hasn&amp;#x27;t yet evolved to the point where it can help them. So a great example of this might be let&amp;#x27;s say you&amp;#x27;re planning a trip and it&amp;#x27;s two days before and you take your suitcase out of the closet and you&amp;#x27;re like, ugh, I forget this thing is broken. The zipper doesn&amp;#x27;t work for some reason, right? And you&amp;#x27;re like, gosh, I don&amp;#x27;t actually have time to go to the store and buy a new suitcase. Gosh, I wish I knew if this favorite retailer, X, Y, Z, was able to deliver me the suitcase of my dreams within ... before I leave for my trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;And if they have that information on the site, they ... you knew that it was in stock and you knew that you could get it, you maybe knew how much you had to pay to get it before the time that you leave because there&amp;#x27;s a cost associated with that, or a value rather, if you have that information, you could make a decision. You could reach your goal of making sure you had ... this is a terrible example, but you know, that you have a suitcase that you can take with you, right? So that would be sort of what I would call an opportunity. Not so much frustration, but your product could evolve if you have a site that sells suitcases for instance, your product could evolve to a state where it could meet your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. No, I love that and I can think of so many real examples, so we&amp;#x27;re going to be thinking a little bit about e-commerce examples, shopping is a good example, but sometimes it&amp;#x27;s SaaS products, but in e-comm, I think about the difference between your search takes too many steps for me to get the results that I want, the filtering is too hard, versus your site has no search on it at all. But there&amp;#x27;s also, and I&amp;#x27;m totally biased, my background is in performance so I really care about speed. So there&amp;#x27;s also this aspect of friction which could be lagginess or slowness, right? Maybe you designed it or the opportunity is met and it&amp;#x27;s there, but it&amp;#x27;s just taking too long. So how do we think about solving for those types of friction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, absolutely. And that&amp;#x27;s a great example of that what I would call that frustration type of friction. You built the thing, but it&amp;#x27;s just not meeting the need because it&amp;#x27;s taking you too long and the thing is spinning and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;So it falls in the first bucket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Because it&amp;#x27;s just not working as designed even though it&amp;#x27;s there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Exactly. But you know, it&amp;#x27;s interested, you mention bucket and then you also mention kind of how do we think about prioritizing friction. Those actually go very hand in hand and what I mean by that is any strong product team is going to have what I call a diverse or balanced backlog of things that they&amp;#x27;re working on. I think about it in buckets. There&amp;#x27;s the bucket of work that you do to drive revenue. There&amp;#x27;s the bucket of work that you do to reduce costs. There&amp;#x27;s the bucket of work around driving C set up, so customer satisfaction, delight. There&amp;#x27;s the bucket of work that really gets that technical performance and infrastructure work and making sure that your product is healthy. And you have these different buckets of work and you realize that you need to be doing all those things to have a product that not only maximizes business value, but also customer delight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;And so when you think about gosh, how would I actually prioritize something that maybe is performance related versus hey, this feature that I know is going to drive revenue. In an ideal situation, you actually don&amp;#x27;t have to trade off between the two. And it&amp;#x27;s not an exact science. It&amp;#x27;s not like you can say, hey, 20 percent of my time every single week is going to be here or there, but you kind of have this idea of this is directionally the types of work that we should be doing, and so then when it gets to ... let&amp;#x27;s say you have a bucket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;How teams define buckets is, you know, there&amp;#x27;s definitely some ... how do I put this? There&amp;#x27;s no exact science but the team has to get together and figure out what are the buckets that we&amp;#x27;re going to sort of slaughter work into. And if you have a bucket that&amp;#x27;s all around hey, maybe it&amp;#x27;s performance issues or maybe it&amp;#x27;s defects or bugs or what not, then you prioritizing against sort of ... you&amp;#x27;re comparing apples to apples in that case. You&amp;#x27;re just saying we know we need to spend some percentage of our capacity making the site more performant, right? These are the things that we can do to address that. Which one&amp;#x27;s going to give us the most value from a business standpoint as well as from a customer standpoint. So that&amp;#x27;s ideally the trade off that you would actually just need to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. Yeah. I think that trade off in value is I think where I always get so stuck where I&amp;#x27;m just like ... so kind of going back, taking a step back, we talked a little bit about prioritizing friction, but even in order to prioritize it, you have to identify that it exists. So what are the tools and processes that you follow to just know that friction&amp;#x27;s happening in the wild?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;That&amp;#x27;s such a good question. There are multiple ways, and some of it goes back to what type of friction are you actually able to identify. The first thing that I love to do when I get into a new space is it&amp;#x27;s a good old journey map. As basic as that is, it&amp;#x27;s the ... what a journey map does is it really enables you to understand your customer and what are the things that they&amp;#x27;re doing today that either help them or make things harder for them. So at the highest level, you identify areas of opportunity where your product could slot in. So as an example, if I&amp;#x27;m ... again, we&amp;#x27;re going to use the same terrible example but we started there so we&amp;#x27;re just going to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;We&amp;#x27;re really attached to the suitcase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, let&amp;#x27;s say that I am suitcase.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Terrible example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Free startup idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Exactly, right? I need to understand when customers come to my site, what are they looking ... what are the goal that they&amp;#x27;re trying to achieve? So going out and identifying what are my personas, who are my customers, what are their personas, and what are the key areas of the workflow, and where do they expect me to slot in or where do they want me to slot in or where could I slot myself in? It&amp;#x27;s really, really important. So that&amp;#x27;s a very good qualitative way of identifying those areas of opportunity, right? When it comes to ... but there are also quantitative ways. So let&amp;#x27;s assume that I am suitcase.com and I know that ... so I have a lot of analytics and tracking and things like that, and I know that my cart-to-order is a certain percentage. If I have the proper analytics set up and the dashboard and all that stuff, when things dip, when defects get introduced or performance issues arise, if I have the right tracking set up and the right alerting, I can actually be notified or be aware that there&amp;#x27;s some sort of friction ... the site, the thing that we&amp;#x27;ve built isn&amp;#x27;t doing what we intended for it to do based on things that we know today. So that&amp;#x27;s sort of a quantitative way that you can identify friction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Of course I have to mention that there are tools like FullStory that actually can play in both buckets, and what I mean by that is we&amp;#x27;ve defined, as you very well know and have used in the past, our frustration heuristics, so we can identify if someone is, for lack of a better word, expressing negative sentiment towards an experience because they&amp;#x27;re ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Rage Clicking, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;So we can identify that, or we could say hey, you know what, we want to look at customers who are going from cart to order to see what that experience looks like and actually qualitatively also become aware of opportunities that we could go after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. Yeah. I love that and I&amp;#x27;ve seen you do this in real life. I feel like the journey map is something that everyone talks about and I think until we started working together, I didn&amp;#x27;t know what the deliverable was. So we&amp;#x27;re talking about the research to actually make an artifact so you can understand why is somebody even on suitcase.com. But then your product, your website, you have all these analytics, you have maybe something like FullStory that&amp;#x27;s going to alert you when friction goes up so you can proactively keep an eye on that as well. I love ... I think you really have to have both. Like if you were just going to have analytics or something like FullStory, and you don&amp;#x27;t have the research to understand the story behind the data, you&amp;#x27;re going to be in a bad spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;So I do want to just take a second. We&amp;#x27;ve been chatting for a minute. If you&amp;#x27;re just joining us, this is FullStory Live, a LinkedIn live series. We&amp;#x27;re talking about friction today and Product Management. So send your questions over. I think I&amp;#x27;m going to ask you one more question and then we&amp;#x27;ll do live Q&amp;amp;A. So if you have an idea or some friendly banter or comment, get it in because we&amp;#x27;re going to that section soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;So last thing I want to ask is, okay, so maybe we&amp;#x27;ve identified a problem, we&amp;#x27;ve prioritized the problem, so we even know, okay, we have bandwidth this week, we&amp;#x27;re going work on it. Maybe it doesn&amp;#x27;t move the needle when you fix it. So what happened? How do you go back and figure out what went wrong when you&amp;#x27;re trying to fix the friction and the fix isn&amp;#x27;t working?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, that&amp;#x27;s another great question. I think the first thing that you have to identify is why were you not able to move the needle, right? To me ... buckets, there are two buckets and how I think about that. The first one is around, did we actually identify the problem correctly as well as the success criteria. So anytime you&amp;#x27;ve identified an opportunity, you have some input that suggests that that&amp;#x27;s something you should do. So for instance, going back to the cart-to-order example, potentially cart-to-order dips and you go, oh, okay, well we&amp;#x27;re seeing this gap in sort of this KPI. So we&amp;#x27;ve identified an opportunity and now we&amp;#x27;re going to go ahead and solve it. As part of that, you define your success criteria to say hey, if we build this thing, we expect cart-to-order to go up by 20, 30 bids, whatever it is. So there&amp;#x27;s a problem identification and the data that goes behind that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Then there&amp;#x27;s the actual thing that we built, the solution. It&amp;#x27;s possible that we actually didn&amp;#x27;t build the right thing. You identified the right opportunity and unsuccess criteria, but the solution just wasn&amp;#x27;t what it needs to be. So the path that you take is going to depend on which bucket you land in. So this one is all around, this is bucket number one, I talk with my hands, about really just validating-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;We both do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;That&amp;#x27;s right. Confirming that you&amp;#x27;re going after the right thing and you&amp;#x27;re measuring correctly, and so that goes into making sure the analytics is set up correctly, that your dash boarding is set up correctly, that you&amp;#x27;ve maybe didn&amp;#x27;t miss an input or made some assumption that actually ended up being false. And then here you go into ... let&amp;#x27;s assume that you did this correctly. So here you go into the solution, so then it&amp;#x27;s just a matter of understanding why didn&amp;#x27;t it actually move the needle. So what I love to do is watch sessions quite frankly. Do I say it or not? I&amp;#x27;m not here to sell, but watching sessions is one really great way to understand what a customer is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;At the same time, just talking to customers. So maybe as simple as leaning over and saying hey, can you use this and experience and tell me what you think? Or doing like a hallway stability test, or something else, and just getting some really quick feedback to see if it&amp;#x27;s something obvious or maybe if you just need to do a lot more research to understand why the thing that you built isn&amp;#x27;t actually solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Totally. This just lights a fire of shame in my heart. I want to share really quick, so this happened to me with the onboarding flow for FullStory, we had our success criteria, we wanted to optimize for people getting FullStory installed. So we actually had that part right and we had the right dashboard set up to see are they getting installed, but it was the solution that we got wrong and the way we caught it was not only by watching sessions, but also listening to our support team. So our Huggers here at FullStory caught it and then I was able to go quantify it with FullStory with the session data. What it actually was was we tried to introduce a one-click installation option, but it required your browser popups to be on and so everyone who tried to click that option failed and it was just like, ah, I&amp;#x27;m so glad. I can&amp;#x27;t even imagine how long that would have taken me to catch if one, customers weren&amp;#x27;t really generous in giving their feedback to me, but two, if we didn&amp;#x27;t actually have the tool to be able to see how many people are going down this path to failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;So I think that&amp;#x27;s ... this is why I think this stuff is so important. So okay, so I want to check the doc and just here on my fancy, glitter space phone here, to see if anything&amp;#x27;s come in. We do have ... okay, so there&amp;#x27;s one question that I definitely want to make sure we address. It came in before the talk even started, and that&amp;#x27;s is there such a thing as good friction? And what do you think about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Great ... oh, that&amp;#x27;s such a good question. I&amp;#x27;m going to actually answer this in multiple ways. So one, as a product practitioner, but also just as a user of the Internet. As a product practitioner, you never want to create an experience that&amp;#x27;s going to irritate a customer, frustrate them, make them unhappy. So full stop, right? That&amp;#x27;s not the intent at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;That&amp;#x27;s not the goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;However ... that&amp;#x27;s right. That&amp;#x27;s not the goal. However, I would say also as a product practitioner anytime you get any input that helps you propel the product forward, that&amp;#x27;s a good input. All right, so if I take that lens, feedback is a gift. And so from that sense, I would say yes, absolutely, friction ... understanding where friction exists is a really, really good thing from a product practitioner&amp;#x27;s standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;As a user of the Internet, I would say that there are absolutely times where friction is a terrible thing and there&amp;#x27;s no way to spin it in a positive way, but I would say plenty of times also when friction really helps slow the user down in a way that&amp;#x27;s really valuable and meaningful to them. So as an example, if you&amp;#x27;re agreeing to something as part of like a sign up flow, you want to be reminded of what you&amp;#x27;re signing up for, as an example. So a modal pops up that&amp;#x27;s like, are you sure that you want to ... yes, please, thank you for reminding me. Or I forget my passwords all the time, and if I&amp;#x27;m going to get locked out after three attempts, please tell me because then I&amp;#x27;ll just take a minute and I&amp;#x27;ll think about it and then I&amp;#x27;ll try to remember my password. I&amp;#x27;ll put a little bit more effort into it. So that&amp;#x27;s really helpful. It stops me in my tracks, but it&amp;#x27;s really there to help me and so I appreciate that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, that really helpful form feedback, because otherwise I really am just going to convince myself I remember what my password is or just type it wrong and try to cram it in. The other one I think about that I think has saved my butt a lot is where they slow you down when you want to delete something. It&amp;#x27;s like, okay, you&amp;#x27;re going to delete this, it&amp;#x27;s not going in the archive trashcan so you can revisit it later, it&amp;#x27;s gone forever. We&amp;#x27;re going to make you sign your name, give us your passport, and type delete the exact element because it&amp;#x27;s like, I don&amp;#x27;t want you to get in that situation where you deleted something you need. So slow UX definitely has a place in design and I think can be part of a delightful experience, even though it can be friction in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Okay, so going back to data. I think this is one where I really feel like it&amp;#x27;s a weak spot for me, so I&amp;#x27;m kind of asking to learn. So how do you know when you have enough data to make a decision about the friction you&amp;#x27;re trying to solve? Otherwise I feel like I could just research in a corner for months and never be confident enough to say got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;That&amp;#x27;s a good question. I would say at the highest level, it depends a lot on how much effort or investment will it take to do the thing that you potentially are going to do with that information. So as an example, if you have one or two customers, they email you and say something like, hey, the text on this button doesn&amp;#x27;t feel right. It seems like you&amp;#x27;re using the wrong words. You can take that piece of feedback, you could take a look at the text and the button, and you could say oh gosh, you know what? They&amp;#x27;re right. That is ... we have introduced friction unintentionally. That&amp;#x27;s going to take me a minute to fix, and you&amp;#x27;ll just go and do it, right? So you just need one or two pieces of feedback and you go with your gut and you&amp;#x27;re done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;However, if you&amp;#x27;re going after an opportunity that&amp;#x27;s going to take, call it, 10 people for nine months, you&amp;#x27;re making a massive investment. At that point, you likely don&amp;#x27;t know how you&amp;#x27;re going to solve for the opportunity. You haven&amp;#x27;t gotten there yet, but you know. You know enough that it&amp;#x27;s going to be a massive investment and so you better make sure that you&amp;#x27;re looking at a lot of different inputs, a lot of different data points, so that you can feel pretty good about making that investment. Yeah. That&amp;#x27;s how I would think about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. No, that makes sense. So it&amp;#x27;s like proportional to the amount of resources or people you need to mobilize, which I guess is just kind of common sense, just out of respect for people&amp;#x27;s time and the risk that you&amp;#x27;re putting into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. I mean it&amp;#x27;s ... exactly. Time is money, and so if you&amp;#x27;re going to invest a lot of time, you have to make sure that you feel good about the decision that you&amp;#x27;re making. I will also say that I think also with time and with experience, you get better at kind of understanding what inputs really matter and which ones matter less. So you may actually get to a place where, call it, 10 years ago you would have ... I&amp;#x27;m simplifying this, you would haven needed 10 inputs to feel pretty good about a decision, but you&amp;#x27;ve learned enough where that you can take a few shortcuts and maybe now you only need four, but you&amp;#x27;ve already invested over the last however many years, and getting those different inputs. So there&amp;#x27;s a little bit of that as well, I&amp;#x27;d say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Okay, so now that makes me want to ask you something else, which I know you&amp;#x27;re going to hate that I&amp;#x27;m asking this, because we agreed we weren&amp;#x27;t going to talk about it before we walked in the room. But is that a case for experimentation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Because sometimes you just need to prove to yourself that it&amp;#x27;s right. Maybe you run an experiment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, absolutely. So I am the biggest fan of AB testing as one form of experimentation, so absolutely, I think that there are definitely times when you should be AB testing where you don&amp;#x27;t have enough data, you don&amp;#x27;t have enough inputs, and we&amp;#x27;re really just putting something out there in the wild and letting customers kind of tell you is a really, really great thing to have. Number one fan of AB testing for sure. For sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, I think what makes me scared about it is sometimes the amount of work. You really have to invest in developing two really good experiences in order to experiment without dropping the ball. So that almost doubles the risks sometimes in terms of what you&amp;#x27;re putting in just to find out which one works. So it&amp;#x27;s such a tricky thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;No, for sure. And I think sometimes it also comes down to well, what if you invest in this thing and it&amp;#x27;s the wrong thing to invest in, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;So then you at least find out earlier. And you can set up AB test in different ways, too, such that you can actually minimize level of effort up front. So for instance, you could do things like fake door tests where you don&amp;#x27;t actually build the thing, but you get enough insight that customers want the thing that you&amp;#x27;re looking to build. So there are ... because you&amp;#x27;re right. You definitely don&amp;#x27;t want to spend too much of an effort building the AB test if you actually ... if there are other things that you could do. So there are ways to get it at some of that. For sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;And I feel like that&amp;#x27;s such a good strategy in marketing as well is just test demand for something. I think there&amp;#x27;s a great thing I&amp;#x27;ve seen happen here in Atlanta where people will make a landing page for a SaaS product or a B to C product even, way before they&amp;#x27;ve started building it just to collect emails and see if people are interesting. So the fake door ... I&amp;#x27;m a big fan of the fake doors. Always curious to know what&amp;#x27;s behind the fake door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;So we only have a couple minutes left. I do want to just kind of transition the conversation back to Product Management at large, and just see if you have any comments you want to share about what it&amp;#x27;s like to work in project management at FullStory, and what people can do if they&amp;#x27;re interested in maybe getting in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, absolutely. So I think that it&amp;#x27;s amazing to work in Product Management at FullStory. I think we have such a great team here as a whole, and then if I think about those folks that we work most closely with, the product managers, the designers, the engineers. I mean, just a phenomenal group of people that I&amp;#x27;ve really enjoyed working with, have learned a ton from. So definitely net positive on the Product Management experience at FullStory. I would say very few people, I think, growing up say I want to be a product manager, so folks find themselves getting into product in different ways, multiple ways to get into Product Management. I think one thing that I think works well and worked well for me personally was working in an organization where there is a product team, and working closely with that team, want to learn more about what it&amp;#x27;s like to be a PM and then the skills that make someone successful, and also to sort of help that team in whatever skillset you end up potentially having.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;And then just making sure that you understand enough about what it means to be a PM and then you kind of slowly, slowly make your way over. I&amp;#x27;ve seen that work many times, not just for myself. That&amp;#x27;s the advice I would give to anybody is if you&amp;#x27;re interested in Product Management, make sure that you raise your hand, make sure that you are doing your due diligence, and working closely with that team. That&amp;#x27;s definitely one way to make it in Product Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;I think that&amp;#x27;s why I went back and was kind of watching the session with Tommy and Hannah. They were talking about his journey. He said no one wakes up thinking they want to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;He found his way in through consulting. Your background is in engineering. What if you&amp;#x27;re a super experienced PM and maybe you&amp;#x27;re just looking for a different work environment, something a little bit different? Is FullStory hiring for people of that caliber at the moment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Oh my gosh, I&amp;#x27;m so happy you said that, and that was not planted. Absolutely. So we are ... FullStory&amp;#x27;s very much a rocket ship, as you know, and so the product team is absolutely growing. So yes, if you happen to be a kick-ass PM, we&amp;#x27;re definitely totally looking for kick-ass PMs. So, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Check out FullStory.com/jobs and-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speaker 3: &lt;/b&gt;We do have any audience question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Oh, okay. Oh, we have an audience question come in. All right. Oh, okay. So Shiv is asking can you define with examples how you find friction in onboarding? I&amp;#x27;m going to try to answer this real quick. So I use FullStory to look for examples of friction in my onboarding, and I literally just build the biggest funnel ever from sign up to getting your magic moment, which it can be getting your script installed or it could also be just talking to a salesperson if that&amp;#x27;s how you prefer to buy. Then I look for the errors in the Rage Clicks. That&amp;#x27;s kind of my process. In a checkout flow, are there things, ways that you identify friction? Maybe in an onboarding sign up? Ideas? Things I missed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, no. I think you hit the nail on the head. I mean that&amp;#x27;s definitely a great way to find areas of friction. That&amp;#x27;s absolutely where you start-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Just the job ... to where the drop off points are. In order to do that, you just need a funnel. So whether or not you&amp;#x27;re using a FullStory funnel or some other analytics tool, you know big funnel is you just want to build it all the steps in, and then look for where the dips are, and then you can kind of slice and dice from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. And you could always just watch customers, to sit next to them and see what they&amp;#x27;re doing and ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Do a little traditional research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, but if you want to do the set, you know, two in the morning, that&amp;#x27;s not an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. I mean, yeah. Yes. Usually. Usually not an option. Somebody mentioned ... a comment we got from somebody was that prototyping tools like Axure are really successful. Have you used something like that before?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Oh, absolutely. Huge fan of prototyping. Multiple tools that you can use for that. But that&amp;#x27;s another really great way to get feedback from customers quickly before you build the thing. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;You build your prototype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;In Axure or InDesign or whatever it is that you-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Invision, Figma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Invision. That&amp;#x27;s what I&amp;#x27;m thinking. InDesign is something else. Figma, yeah. Whatever those are. Or draw it on a piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, paper prototype, and that&amp;#x27;s a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;It&amp;#x27;s never led me astray. I think that might be all of our audience questions. We are getting kind of close to time. If you have ... I&amp;#x27;m going to look for one last minute, if you have something like a burning desire, something you&amp;#x27;re thinking about, you want to comment it in. I&amp;#x27;m going to give it just a second before we wrap up. I think, too, you know, the conversation does not end here. So if you have ideas, things come up after this recording, or you&amp;#x27;re visiting this later, you can always comment, send a comment of FullStory&amp;#x27;s LinkedIn feed. We watch that pretty regularly. Or send us a Tweet. We have a whole team of Huggers that help us respond to our Tweets. We are always interested to hear from customers and just folks who are doing this about what&amp;#x27;s working for them. Reach out. If there are no other questions, then what I&amp;#x27;ll do is just kind of close it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Agata, I just want to say thank you so much for sitting here with me today. This was really fun. It was kind of a good break in the workflow. I&amp;#x27;m going to ... do you have any final thoughts, like last parting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Oh gosh. Parting thoughts. I mean this has been great. And to your point, the conversation doesn&amp;#x27;t stop here, and so definitely if anyone has comments or questions or ways that they think about this that might be different, I would love to learn more. I&amp;#x27;m always looking to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, challenge us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yes, exactly. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Okay. Great. Then yeah, I think that&amp;#x27;s it. Leave your comments, follow us on LinkedIn, stay in touch with FullStory. We&amp;#x27;ve got content like this shipping out all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agata Bugaj: &lt;/b&gt;Yep. Thanks, Melanie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Melanie Crissey: &lt;/b&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s get back to it ... thank you. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch | The power of cross-functional collaboration]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hanna Woodburn and Justin Dilley sit down to discuss cross-functional collaboration.]]></description><link>https://www.fullstory.com/resources/cross-functional-collaboration/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.fullstory.com/resources/cross-functional-collaboration/</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hunter Garrett]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2019 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“As a product manager we can get too focused on the building of features and not enough focus on establishing relationships across the company.”&lt;/i&gt;

— Justin Dilley, Head of Product at FullStory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;How does cross-functional collaboration work at a growing software company like FullStory? Hanna Woodburn, Product Marketing Manager at FullStory, sat down with Justin Dilley, FullStory Head of Product and former product manager at &lt;a href=&quot;https://homedepot.com/&quot;&gt;The Home Depot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, to discuss this and other issues in our recent &lt;b&gt;LinkedIn Live&lt;/b&gt; that originally aired on May 22, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Justin and Hanna focused on cross-functional collaboration, and covering topics including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What cross-functional collaboration looks like at FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenges of cross-functional collaboration—including remote work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to balance building strong cross-functional relationships with a high-performance company culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;Watch the full session below—or read through the transcript, which you&amp;#x27;ll find below it.

Thanks for joining. I&amp;#x27;m Hanna Woodburn. I work in product marketing here at FullStory. I&amp;#x27;m so excited to be here with Justin Dilley, our Head of Product. This is our first LinkedIn Live session. So we&amp;#x27;re thrilled to be here. This is the first of a series of conversations that we&amp;#x27;re going to have with product managers about skills and tips and challenges that they face. So thanks for joining me today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, super excited to be here and chatting with you guys in this LinkedIn Live situation, and chatting with you about all things product management, Hanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;That&amp;#x27;s awesome. So like I said, this will be a first in a series of sessions. It is obviously live, so if you have questions, please leave them below. Leave us comments. If you don&amp;#x27;t follow FullStory yet on LinkedIn, give us a follow and we&amp;#x27;ll get started. So for people who aren&amp;#x27;t familiar with FullStory, we are a digital intelligence platform and we help eCommerce and SaaS companies understand their digital experiences and improve it. You&amp;#x27;re the Head of Product. How long have you been at FullStory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been at FullStory just a little over a year. I joined in March of last year as product manager number one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;That&amp;#x27;s awesome. Yeah, I remember you interviewed me, it was your second or third week. So what did you do before you came to FullStory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;So I&amp;#x27;ve been in product management for the last, I don&amp;#x27;t know, maybe five-ish years. Before FullStory, I was at Home Depot. I was a product manager leading their mobile app team. And then before Home Depot I was at Amazon, doing a number of different product related roles, everything from their Kindle Fire tablets to their dash replenishment service. And so I&amp;#x27;ve got a pretty broad history of B to C and B to B experience in the broad management world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Awesome. So this conversation is about cross-functional collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Great topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;I love this topic because we work together, product marketing and product management work really closely at FullStory, and it&amp;#x27;s just a topic that&amp;#x27;s near and dear to my heart. And I know that you care about it a lot as well. So when we think about product management and cross-functional collaboration, what has that traditionally looked like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;I think for most product managers that means working with your engineering team, working with your design team, you would consider those your core team that you work with every day. I think one of the things that&amp;#x27;s most interesting about product management is it&amp;#x27;s naturally a very cross-functional role just by its nature. At the end of the day most product managers don&amp;#x27;t have a full team reporting to them. And so the way they get things done is actually through influence of other people working cross-functionally across the organization. But I think traditionally when people think about product management and cross collaboration, the core team is really design, engineering and product management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;So who are you working with cross-functionally at FullStory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;That&amp;#x27;s a good question. It&amp;#x27;s interesting, at FullStory, it&amp;#x27;s maybe slightly different than some of the other roles that I&amp;#x27;ve had before, where in traditional roles or in other roles that I&amp;#x27;ve had where you have more of a traditional product line reporting structure, where you work for a director of product management who works for a VP of Product Management, and you might own a specific product line and you&amp;#x27;ll go deep with your engineering and design colleagues, but you don&amp;#x27;t have as much interaction maybe outside of that core team. I think one of the nice things that I really love about FullStory is the structure that we have in place allows you to, and essentially forces you to in a lot of ways, to think beyond your core team of design and engineering, and think about marketing and sales and product marketing and interacting with those folks that again, aren&amp;#x27;t necessarily traditionally your sweet spot of who you collaborate with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. So if you&amp;#x27;re thinking about, you&amp;#x27;re hiring product managers here at FullStory, what are the skills that you look for that make someone you&amp;#x27;re like, okay, this person&amp;#x27;s going to be really good at it, at getting buy in from different parts of the organization and working really well cross-functionally?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, that&amp;#x27;s a good question. I think the handful of things I look for in a product manager, one is a good solid technical foundation. I mean FullStory as a product is just naturally a technical product. And so being able to converse on a high level and a pretty low level with smart engineers and really functional designers I think is a super important skill set. And then the second thing is really that cross collaboration skillset. Somebody that has the ability to influence the organization without a ton of formal authority. So looking for folks that have built that skillset within their product management career. And then maybe the last thing is kind of spidey sense, like what is their real spidey sense for what a well designed and built product is. And probing in and around some of those areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, that&amp;#x27;s great. I think from my perspective, you guys do a really great job of working cross-functionally. And one of the things that I think about in terms of cross-functional collaboration is it&amp;#x27;s so relationship driven, you need to have those strong ties to other parts of the business. And part of that is just having good relationships with people. That&amp;#x27;s a great way to get information shared and to get buy in and things like that. How do you balance that sort of relational component of cross-functional collaboration with trying to ship new features and the goals and KPIs that you&amp;#x27;re tracking towards?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;I mean I think you certainly have to do both in a lot of ways. And I think it really comes from a foundation of trying to establish a relationship based on trust. Where I trust you and you trust me and we&amp;#x27;re operating from the same set of principles, if you will. And that takes time. And you definitely have to work at that. And so you want to balance that and it&amp;#x27;s easy, I think in some ways, as a product manager to get too focused on the building of features and not enough focus spent or time spent on establishing relationships across the company or even just communicating with your cross-functional peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;It&amp;#x27;s really easy to get siloed into your team and not necessarily think beyond, hey, we&amp;#x27;ve got a product marketing team that needs to be looped in on new features and functionality we&amp;#x27;re rolling out. We&amp;#x27;ve got a giant sales team that we&amp;#x27;re working with. They need to be educated on what we&amp;#x27;re building and when it&amp;#x27;s going to ultimately roll out to customers. And so I think it&amp;#x27;s definitely a balance and I think what I try and do is spend some intentional time actually not as focused on the building of the features and maybe a little bit more intentional time spent on creating those cross-functional relationships. And again, a foundation of trust, I think is something that&amp;#x27;s big and that really can go a long ways when you think about building a successful company and certainly building successful products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Just a reminder, this is live. So if you have any comments, if you have specific tips about cross-functional collaboration, please share those below. Any questions for Justin? Add those as well and we&amp;#x27;ll get to them later in this session. So we talked a little bit about working with sales, and we have a growing sales team here who we&amp;#x27;re constantly trying to enable. How do you think it&amp;#x27;s best to communicate with sales teams, in particular when you&amp;#x27;re a product manager?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, I think one of the traps that I think a lot of product folks fall into is in the over promise and under deliver stance where you talk about building features and functionality and you&amp;#x27;re constantly getting feedback from sales about what&amp;#x27;s resonating with customers, ultimately what they want to see in the product. And I think it&amp;#x27;s making sure that you establish a clear set of principles into how you talk about what&amp;#x27;s on your roadmap or the things that you&amp;#x27;re currently working on. How do you inform sales or get sales enough information to make sure that they feel comfortable talking about the generalities of some of the things that we have going on here at FullStory, but making sure that that process is really two way. Where it&amp;#x27;s not just product saying, Oh, here&amp;#x27;s the roadmap and this is when you&amp;#x27;re going to get these features delivered in this particular quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;But it&amp;#x27;s really that conversational element about, hey, here&amp;#x27;s what we&amp;#x27;re thinking about. You guys talk to customers every day and you&amp;#x27;re having the hard conversations about where our product is a good fit, but maybe where it isn&amp;#x27;t a good fit and how do we really close the loop on that feedback. So sales feels like they do have and they should have a voice in informing what we work on next. It&amp;#x27;s that balance of getting their feedback and input, synthesizing that into a clear coherent product roadmap is one input and then pushing that back out to them and it&amp;#x27;s that constant process of getting their feedback and then pushing on your information to them that I think is what I spend some time on and what the team spends some time on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;I feel like there&amp;#x27;s a trend that we&amp;#x27;re seeing here of, great communication is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, it is. I mean I think when you think about cross-functional relationships, communication is at the heart of everything and it can be a bit of a failure mode, I think, for product managers when they get too insular with what they&amp;#x27;re working on and they don&amp;#x27;t take the time to step back and say, actually I should poll the product marketing team and they might be able to help with messaging on this or help me think about this brand new functionality that I&amp;#x27;m working on. How might this resonate with customers? Or maybe I&amp;#x27;ll pull somebody in from the sales team to get their perspective because they&amp;#x27;re talking to prospects. And again, I think by making sure that you&amp;#x27;re spending that intentional time establishing, building and facilitating the relationships cross-functionally, I think it makes you a better product manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;So if you see a product manager become insular and they&amp;#x27;re just focusing too much on getting stuff done and not really looking outward to what else is happening in the business, how do you coach them through that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, I think there&amp;#x27;s some things to kind of break the mold there, and one is getting them to spend some more time with cross-functional peers in context to having customer conversations. So one of the things that I talk to my team about all the time is, jump into a sales conversation with somebody on the sales team. Join a product marketing exercise that you guys go through on your side. And I think that gives you a very different perspective and can break a little bit of the routine of saying, okay, well I&amp;#x27;m going to go do my customer discovery work or I&amp;#x27;m going to work with my engineering and design team to build this particular feature. It&amp;#x27;s getting them out into the field with sales or just on conversations with sales. Getting them more integrated into the marketing team I think can break a lot of the badness of not having those cross-functional relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, I think that&amp;#x27;s something that I experience as well when I am feeling like, okay, I&amp;#x27;m just too focused on what I&amp;#x27;m doing. If I hop on a sales call, I immediately see areas where, oh, we could be adding value as product marketers or, gosh, I didn&amp;#x27;t realize this was a question that&amp;#x27;s coming up, or people really love this part of the product. It&amp;#x27;s very illuminating and I think that it&amp;#x27;s something that really all of us who work on customer facing products should do regularly for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Even getting out of the office, you and I have spent some time at conferences and on the road, and I think that&amp;#x27;s actually a really interesting place to pressure test your five second message, your 30-second message, your two minute quick demo. And as a product manager, getting out of the office, getting into that conference environment and just having to explain what FullStory is, how it works, why we&amp;#x27;re different, how we can add value, and then be able to actually show customers, gets you a very different perspective in a lot of ways on what you&amp;#x27;re building as a product manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, definitely. That totally resonates with me. If you&amp;#x27;re watching and that resonates with you, please let us know. If you have any tips for fostering cross-functional collaboration that have been really successful for your organization, leave those below, as well as any questions. So let&amp;#x27;s talk about roadblocks to cross-functional collaboration. It&amp;#x27;s really great, yes, everybody should be doing this. However, there&amp;#x27;s only so many hours in the day. What are challenges that you&amp;#x27;ve seen for fostering cross-functional collaboration, especially as the team grows and scales?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;I mean I think just naturally as the team gets bigger and bigger and bigger, it&amp;#x27;s hard to stay connected one on one with individuals. And so if you think about your core team as beyond just the product family here, we call them families here at FullStory. We&amp;#x27;ll get into that a little bit probably. But just focusing on, let&amp;#x27;s identify who my core team is that is not just a part of the people that I might traditionally think of working with day to day and it&amp;#x27;s like, okay, my core team&amp;#x27;s actually product marketing. Maybe you&amp;#x27;ve got an advocate from sales, maybe you have somebody in the marketing team, maybe if somebody in our business operations team, but thinking broadly about them as being the core team is a challenge for sure in terms of being able to spend your time throughout the day. But I think that is the real way to stop the cycle of not getting feedback from other folks and not having an input from the other team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;And so again, I think it really comes down to just being intentional about what you want to do, who you want to involve in it, and then ultimately making sure that you progress on that. But I think in terms of challenges, I&amp;#x27;m trying to think. Challenges that I recently faced, I faced, this is just a personal growth area for me, is outward communication, really broad communication. In my role, I spend a lot of time working with the rest of the other heads of family here. And you know, being able to find my voice as a product leader and being able to communicate out broadly across the entire product team, but also the company, and really finding the right rhythm and cadence and messaging about what we&amp;#x27;re working on, ultimately why it&amp;#x27;s important and why it matters to everybody here at the company, at FullStory. And so that&amp;#x27;s something that I find is a natural roadblock to establishing those and definitely something that I work on pretty frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;So you&amp;#x27;ve hinted at our structure here, which is certainly unique. Why don&amp;#x27;t you talk a little bit about how you think that helps foster cross-functional collaborative?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;I mentioned this before, in traditional kind of product management organizations where you might be aligned by a product line and you&amp;#x27;ll report up through a traditional product management structure. We&amp;#x27;ve got a little bit of a different organizational design here at FullStory. So we call it the matrix, as you know, and it&amp;#x27;s organized on two axes, one axis being the practice axis. So that the practice of product management, the practice of engineering, the practice of design, think about that access as being your more traditional reporting structure, who you identify with, what your title might be on LinkedIn. And so that&amp;#x27;s on one axis. And then on the other axis we have families. So these are organizations set up to achieve a set of business outcomes. And so I&amp;#x27;m the head of family for the product family, which can and does include a number of different folks from different practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;So we&amp;#x27;re heavy in engineering and design and product management, but we also have designers in the design practice live in the marketing family. And so there&amp;#x27;s another head of family that leads up the marketing family, but the ability to have somebody in the design practice or the engineering practice live in multiple families, I think breaks down a little bit of the silos that get built up when you&amp;#x27;re in a traditional product line organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, definitely. How do you see cross-functional collaboration evolving at FullStory? Do you have a sense of what it looks like in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, that&amp;#x27;s a good question. I mean, I&amp;#x27;ll tell you one of the things that I&amp;#x27;ve been spending a lot of time thinking about is as we establish more of a remote culture here at FullStory. That&amp;#x27;s something we&amp;#x27;re really big on, is how do we find the best people. They don&amp;#x27;t necessarily have to be here in Atlanta, and let them be remote. It&amp;#x27;s really finding the right tools and mechanisms to communicate and establish those cross-functional relationships for folks that aren&amp;#x27;t here and the folks that you don&amp;#x27;t see every day, folks that you may just see on a video conference and they may only come to Atlanta once a quarter. And so being able to establish some norms and processes around coming up with and establishing a really effective remote work culture, and establishing those cross collaboration exercises. Again, I think if you&amp;#x27;re not spending the time actively doing it, then it just falls by the wayside. And so you have to be intentional about spending time and it makes it even harder when folks are remote, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, that&amp;#x27;s definitely a great point. I think that as we do move to have more people remote, it&amp;#x27;s one of those things where you think a lot about, oh, are they going to be involved in this meeting and how do we dial people in and make sure that we&amp;#x27;re communicating clearly with them. But it changes the dynamic of those relationships as well. And so you have to be hyper focused on fostering healthy relationships in a lot of different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;It was interesting. You know, we just moved in to new office here and we were remote as a whole company for a week, and it was really challenging to operate in a way where you take for granted that you can&amp;#x27;t just walk over to somebody&amp;#x27;s desk and ask them a question and get some of those collaborative meetings done. And that was a real trying exercise, I think, in a lot of ways. One of the things that I found was really nice is we did this video kickoff, run the OKR process and we did that video kickoff for the company, kind of asynchronously. I thought that was actually a really effective way at communicating, in some ways collaborating across the entire company. And so I&amp;#x27;m hopeful we can do some more of those. And I think that helps remote folks as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, definitely. I have so much more empathy for remote people after that week because it definitely was a struggle. So speaking of empathy, we have a few watchwords here at FullStory: clarity, empathy and bionics. Which of those do you think is most applicable to your work on cross-functional collaboration? Is there one that sticks out above the rest?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;I think if I was going to stack rank them, in some ways it&amp;#x27;s probably clarity, empathy, and then bionics. I think establishing clarity among the decisions you&amp;#x27;re making and why you&amp;#x27;re making them and ultimately getting work done, if you&amp;#x27;re not clear and you don&amp;#x27;t have clarity, that can such a big problem for achieving all of the great things that we want to achieve here and value we want to add for our customers at FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;And so I think a lot of it starts from the base of clarity, and then empathy is maybe just a very close second, is both empathizing with your peers, and empathizing with your customers and making sure that that is really well understood and rooted in being truly empathetic about everything that they have going on. There&amp;#x27;s always the, Oh, the last minute requests that you have that comes in, or you have to say no to somebody. I mean, those can be really hard things, and if you&amp;#x27;re not super empathetic to what they&amp;#x27;re trying to do or the outcome that they&amp;#x27;re trying to achieve, I think that can create a real problem for collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, for sure. So we&amp;#x27;ve talked a lot about why a cross-functional collaboration is good for us internally. Do you think that helps us build better products?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;I think so. And I think even extending collaboration into the customer realm, like having customers involved more frequently beyond just the walls of FullStory. So thinking about FullStory as being able to execute on a particular set of things and achieve an outcome that we want. But how do we bring our customers into that conversation? And that&amp;#x27;s one of the things I think a lot about and we&amp;#x27;ve got our hugging family, which is really our customer support and success, as a really high leverage area for us to go and have that conversation with customers and be collaborative with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;I think it&amp;#x27;s really easy to think again about cross-functional collaboration as just your core team, and maybe you&amp;#x27;re thinking about it as the company, but how can you start to pull in customers and make what you&amp;#x27;re working on and the things that you think are important? Make that a little bit more of a two way dialogue with your customers, I think is something that we spend a lot of time thinking about, and empathy to your point is one of our watch words. And so empathizing with our customers and being able to loop them in on these things is something that I think is super important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. That&amp;#x27;s awesome. I love that. So one last question from me and then we&amp;#x27;ll move to questions from the audience. Can you think of a time when cross-functional collaboration was an absolute failure? Doesn&amp;#x27;t have to be here at FullStory. It could be any time in your career where it just didn&amp;#x27;t happen and it was not good as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;I won&amp;#x27;t go into too many specifics, but there was a product that I was working on, and we were basically getting ready for the final launch process. We were putting kind of the finishing touches on the product and we were ready to kind of release it to the world, only to find out that the marketing team, who would do all of the marketing of what we were building, was just not ready. And at the end of the day we hadn&amp;#x27;t really brought them along. And so it was really a problem for me, in that I didn&amp;#x27;t do a good enough job communicating expectations on dates. And dates are always this shifting thing and so just really could have done a much better job communicating with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;I mean, it ultimately all worked out and we scrambled. But that&amp;#x27;s a real way to damage a relationship in a lot of ways. And so I think about that instance when I&amp;#x27;m working even with product marketing today and working with you and your team and thinking about, I don&amp;#x27;t want you guys to be the last ones to find out about our plans as a product team and wanting to make sure that you guys are riding shotgun, I think is is a big learning that I learned from this experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, that&amp;#x27;s great. All right, so we&amp;#x27;ll turn to questions that we have from the audience. If you have questions, you&amp;#x27;re watching this, please feel free to type them in. So the first one is, how has data and metrics storytelling enabled cross-functional collaboration towards a same sense of purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Well, I mean I think data is a common language among the teams and can be a really good tie breaker if you&amp;#x27;re not really sure which direction to go. And so if everybody is looking at the same data, using the same source of data, it can be a way to really drive clear, effective decision making. You know, people talk a lot about being a data driven organization, and I think that is something that&amp;#x27;s super important. I think in some ways that gets a bit abused to be only looking at data. And so I think it&amp;#x27;s very much a balance of being a data informed organization, and really thinking through how do you use data to understand your customers to understand what their pain points are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;So when you&amp;#x27;re building products or thinking about building products that everybody&amp;#x27;s on the same page of what the problem is. And I think that can be kind of the great democratizer out there. If you can get everybody to clearly understand and articulate what the problem is with data and then figuring out why that&amp;#x27;s a problem we&amp;#x27;re solving, again with a set of data, that makes the entire product development process just a ton easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, I think that resonates with me as well. If I think about how we&amp;#x27;ve worked together and just thinking through, how do we go to market with a feature, having data about how people are using it in a Beta and what their feedback is and what are the stories that we&amp;#x27;re starting to get out of those users is really helpful for me to say, okay, this is the vision they have, and then help translate that vision into the sales team and the marketing team and make sure that we&amp;#x27;re all reading off of the same sheet of music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, exactly. And again, I think it can be that common language among different teams and can really be a way to hammer home some certain points about like, we really need to hit customers with this particular message because boy, you know, there they gave us feedback or we see in the data that we have at FullStory. And so I think it&amp;#x27;s a really, really good approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. And it also can say, we need to change this or fix this. It&amp;#x27;s great for motivating on that end too. All right. So Jacob has a question. Are there any specific tools FullStory uses to help the functionality of their communications?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;That&amp;#x27;s a good question. So we&amp;#x27;re a pretty big slack heavy company, and I would say in general we spend a lot of time thinking about asynchronous communication. And I think that&amp;#x27;s one thing that if you think about building muscles to help with communication, is it really is that asynchronous communication. And so for us, the core tools that we use everyday are slack and Gmail and the whole G suite of Google docs and Google slides. Our main kind of project a database is a tool called the clubhouse. And so there&amp;#x27;s a ton of asynchronous communication that happens, either direct feedback in a document or a note on a particular clubhouse card or epic. That&amp;#x27;s how we manage most of our features and functionality that we&amp;#x27;re delivering to customers. And so I think it&amp;#x27;s really getting good at that asynchronous communication. It&amp;#x27;s easy to schedule a 30 minute meeting, but you don&amp;#x27;t always need that 30 minute meeting. And in some ways you can get a lot more done asynchronously, and so I think that&amp;#x27;s a good muscle to build when you think about collaboration and communication is building those asynchronous muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. How do you create buy in for those tools? Do you ever experience resistance where people are like, I don&amp;#x27;t want to log my tasks in clubhouse, or, I would rather use email over slack, or how do you change the social norms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, that&amp;#x27;s a good question. I think if you focus on, there&amp;#x27;s always a problem when you think about the product development process, there&amp;#x27;s a problem, hey, we don&amp;#x27;t have a good sense of how big certain things are. Maybe we&amp;#x27;re not great at our project management muscles. And so if you can get folks to agree on, yeah, this is a problem, then you can start to suggest particular solutions and they don&amp;#x27;t always have to be a tool. It could just be a Google doc or a slack channel. But I think having everybody come from the same place as, this is a problem. I&amp;#x27;m not able to do my job as effectively as I could. Then you can start to open people&amp;#x27;s minds and then selecting certain software, their minds will be just naturally more open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;You can say, Hey, well this tool actually does exactly what we would want and we all agreed that this was a problem, so let&amp;#x27;s give this a try and try and Beta test it. And then I think you have to give people the flexibility to do things that work for them. I think if you come up with a, everybody should do it this way, that doesn&amp;#x27;t really work for everybody, and I think you end up in a place where you&amp;#x27;ve got a process or a tool that just doesn&amp;#x27;t work for anybody. And so having some built in flexibility into what people can use from a tool standpoint, how they use it, just making sure that you&amp;#x27;ve got enough flexibility built into that, so that everybody feels like, Hey, for my team or my area, I can get what I need out of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, definitely. There&amp;#x27;s a comment here that I think is great. Celebrate your successes with cross-functional collaboration. When you launch or complete a project, make sure you give the kudos for the success of the team working together. That&amp;#x27;s from Steve with Bradley Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, that&amp;#x27;s great. Yeah it is something that is easy to forget. We at FullStory, we do this Friday meeting, we call hug it out every Friday, and we&amp;#x27;ve got a little section as part of our standing agenda to do toasts and I know that the team takes that really seriously, where it&amp;#x27;s your chance to recognize a coworker or a set of coworkers for something that you did during the week, and you can recognize them across the whole company. It doesn&amp;#x27;t have to just be centered around a specific product launch, but taking those moments for, people end up, I mean I know I do. You spend your blood, sweat and tears on something and taking a little bit of time to celebrate those successes and celebrate failures in a lot of ways, I think it&amp;#x27;s pretty important. Great comment Steven, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;One last comment, Angela from Curtis says, Justin, I love your product. What are your thoughts on good process versus bad process as your company grows?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Oh man, that&amp;#x27;s good. That&amp;#x27;s a really tough question. I think in the good process camp is coming up with a set of, for lack of a better word, processes that everybody feels like, this is the way to build successful products. So for us at FullStory, where that comes to life is we establish a set of annual, quarterly, and then five week-ish OKRs, and so if you spend time on the outcomes that you want to achieve or the objectives in the OKR process and then think through what the key results are, that will help you achieve those objectives. That&amp;#x27;s a really good process to stay focused on making sure you&amp;#x27;re building the right things. And then a bad process in a lot of ways is not communicating. You know, I&amp;#x27;ve talked about it, we talk about that, and Hannah and I talked about that here, is if you get so insulated into just your product team and you don&amp;#x27;t pop your head up to communicate broadly across any organization, I think that could be a bit of a bad process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Great. Well, thank you so much for sharing your time and insights with us today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Dilley: &lt;/b&gt;Thanks for chatting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;I really appreciate it.

It&amp;#x27;s Hanna with FullStory here with another session of FullStory LinkedIn Live. I&amp;#x27;m so excited to be here with Tommy Noonan, a product manager here at FullStory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. Thanks, Hanna. Happy to be here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Thanks for joining us this Friday afternoon. We&amp;#x27;re coming at you from our FullStory headquarters here in Atlanta, Georgia. Today we&amp;#x27;re going to be talking about product metrics. Just a reminder, this is a live session, so please feel free to leave any comments below. If you have questions, we&amp;#x27;ll answer those later on in this session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Also, we&amp;#x27;re going to be talking about metrics today, and if this is a topic that you&amp;#x27;re really excited about, we&amp;#x27;re having a webinar actually later on in June with Amplitude. We&amp;#x27;ll be talking about north star metrics and how do you create north star metrics, what does that mean for your business. There should be a link in the comments if you&amp;#x27;re interested in joining that webinar. Please do sign up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Tommy, just to kick us off, tell us a little bit about yourself. How did you end up at FullStory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, for sure. I actually started my career at Accenture as a systems integration consultant. I did a lot of things like building custom solutions for more larger enterprise clients. Then I actually came to FullStory from business school. I interned at Google as a product management intern on their mobile search team right before switching to here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Cool. How did you fall into product management?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. That is a great question. I feel like when I got to grad school, I had never heard of a product manager before, but I knew I really wanted to work with data to make decisions, be in front of customers, and affect the development or the strategy of the product. Everybody was like, &amp;quot;Yeah. It really sounds like a B2B product manager.&amp;quot; I was like, &amp;quot;Yes. That&amp;#x27;s what I want to do. That&amp;#x27;s what I want to get into.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;That&amp;#x27;s awesome. You&amp;#x27;re obviously very interested in data and how we can make better decisions using data. How do you think about product metrics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, for sure. To me, product metrics are all about decision making. They should be able to enable your organization to make better decisions faster. I kind of think about that along two axes. First is strategically. It&amp;#x27;s, &amp;quot;Are you tracking the right metrics?&amp;quot; I think about that as I want my metrics to tell me are customers being able to, I guess, complete the use cases that they&amp;#x27;re coming to our product to do. Operationally, that&amp;#x27;s all about, &amp;quot;Are the metrics easy for everyone to interpret, to read? Is everybody on the same page? Do they know where to find them?&amp;quot;, but more of ... actually once you have the metrics, what do you do with them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, because you have to do something with that data, otherwise it&amp;#x27;s not operationalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;I hope people do stuff with it, at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. What&amp;#x27;s the difference between a product metric and a KPI?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. I actually think of these as fairly similar. At least, I use the two terms pretty interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. Do you think that PMs are the best person to be the owner of product metrics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;I actually do think PMs should be the owner, but it needs to be a collaborative process. What I mean by that is I&amp;#x27;m definitely a firm believer that if everybody owns something, no one owns something. Kind of a tragedy of the commons type thing. Like I said, it needs to be collaborative. There are some things that maybe an engineer or a designer might understand a little bit better than a product manager. Product managers should probably work with their customer success teams and their support teams to get a better understanding of what their actual customers are saying when they start to develop metrics that they&amp;#x27;re going to actually make decisions off of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;That makes sense. We talked last week about cross-functional collaboration, and it seems like that&amp;#x27;s just a recurring theme that I hear when I talk with PMs, both here at FullStory and at other companies, is no matter your role as a PM, whether you&amp;#x27;re focused on data or launching new features or whatever, it&amp;#x27;s really you&amp;#x27;re connecting to other people across the business to understand how do we move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, and that&amp;#x27;s a great point. Product metrics are important because they help create that alignment between all these different organizations at your company. Without product metrics, it&amp;#x27;s hard for everybody to speak on the same page. It&amp;#x27;s hard for people to prioritize things if everybody is kind of focused on different metrics or different ways to think about things. I feel like the mental resources that we all have are kind of the scarcest resource that we have at companies like this, and so being able to prioritize things quickly and effectively is super important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. What makes a good product metric versus a bad one? Is there a bad one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;I think there are probably certainly bad ones, but it also depends on what you&amp;#x27;re trying to track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Churn, to me, is actually an example of potentially a great product metric. What better way for someone to tell you that they&amp;#x27;re not getting use out of their product for them to actually stop using you and churn? But it can also be a bad product metric because if I&amp;#x27;m looking at churn, it&amp;#x27;s kind of too late. I would like to know that customers or users aren&amp;#x27;t completing their use cases well before they actually make the decision to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, so you need some of those leading indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, definitely. We&amp;#x27;re a quick growing company. Let&amp;#x27;s talk a little bit about growth. How do you think product metrics change throughout growth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. Product metrics definitely can and should change as the company grows, and I definitely want to reiterate that it all goes back to the customer and how your product is evolving to meet your customer&amp;#x27;s needs. I think an example of that would be like at FullStory, we probably originally found product market fit more in the SaaS support use cases. How do we best serve those customers? They were coming into FullStory every day to analyze different customer trends, watch sessions of people encountering bugs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;That was something that we said daily active users is very important for us at that time. As our product has evolved a little bit, and as we start tackling new use cases, such as conversion rate optimization, product manager use cases, we decided that daily active user isn&amp;#x27;t a necessity for these users, so maybe weekly active is the right way to start thinking about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;There&amp;#x27;s definitely never going to be a light that comes on that says, &amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s time to change your product metrics.&amp;quot; Nothing is black and white, but I think the perpetual, constantly reevaluating who my customers are, how are they most getting value out of my product, is the best way to really decide what metrics should I be tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. For those of you who are joining us, I&amp;#x27;m talking with Tommy Noonan. He&amp;#x27;s a product manager here at FullStory. We&amp;#x27;re talking about metrics. If you have any thoughts on product metrics, either ones that you think are really great or other ideas about how you measure engagement with your app, please feel free to post those in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;We talked a little bit about how as your company evolves, your customer base usually evolves, your market fit evolves, and your metrics need to evolve as well. How do you keep your metrics fresh?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, for sure ... It&amp;#x27;s kind of like what are the customer interactions. You need to be very in tune with what your customers are doing and what are the most important features and what are the core problems they&amp;#x27;re trying to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;That&amp;#x27;s certainly key. We&amp;#x27;ve actually developed a north star metric, which I know we&amp;#x27;re having our webinar on in a couple weeks. It&amp;#x27;s a way for us to say, &amp;quot;There&amp;#x27;s a lot of different metrics out there. There&amp;#x27;s probably a lot of different use cases people are trying to do, but this is the thing that we hold, I guess, above the rest of them.&amp;quot; An example of that at FullStory is we actually track weekly active explorers, so users that come into our app once a week and use search or segment, as our metric that, as of right now, we&amp;#x27;re tracking as the core metric for FullStory product team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. I think it&amp;#x27;s really clarifying to have a north star metric because then you&amp;#x27;re able to say, &amp;quot;Okay. We have all of this data, we have all these metrics, and this is the one that we really care about tracking towards, the one we really want to prioritize.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Definitely. That goes all back into the alignment of different teams, but it also speaks to what happens when metrics go up or down. How do we interpret the change that we&amp;#x27;re seeing? In my opinion, interpreting and reading that change is probably more important than the metrics themselves. When you have a north star metric and you actually take the time to socialize it and weave it throughout the fabric of your product team, it really can be enlightening in terms of, &amp;quot;Oh. A metric that we have is going down or up, but it doesn&amp;#x27;t change our north star metric. That might be something that we prioritize. This is not the most burning thing on my plate right now. I can look at that at the end of the week. It&amp;#x27;s not a drop everything that I&amp;#x27;m doing right now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, yeah. That&amp;#x27;s a good rubric. When you think about metrics and socializing them, how do you go about doing that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, for sure. Data is certainly the great equalizer, to me. I think of myself as a data-driven person, so I probably rely on that maybe even more than I should, but it always is really helpful when you&amp;#x27;re going to people that you know have to be bought in on a north star metric, whether it&amp;#x27;s product marketers, engineering managers, what have you, to say, &amp;quot;There&amp;#x27;s a reason why I&amp;#x27;m led to this specific metric.&amp;quot; Maybe it&amp;#x27;s something that reflects what you think of as the core strength of your product. Maybe it&amp;#x27;s something that you think of as the users that use this metric tell us that they&amp;#x27;re getting the most value out of our product. Being able to back up why you&amp;#x27;re choosing one thing or another is, to me, extremely important when it comes to actually convincing everybody to come around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, definitely. You talked a little bit about responding when your metric either goes down or up. How do you know when you should respond versus, &amp;quot;Oh, this is just normal fluctuations based on things that are happening&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. This is definitely a million dollar question, and I&amp;#x27;m sure it keeps a lot of people up, myself included, at night. One of the ways I tackle that is with the north star metric. It at least gives me a little bit of clarity in terms of, &amp;quot;Okay. This is going down. It&amp;#x27;s important, but it&amp;#x27;s not necessarily the most burning thing on my plate.&amp;quot; Also, we have the idea of like KPI or metrics trees. Those are probably best represented by how are our metrics related to each other, or how does one thing affect another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Taking our weekly active explorer, for instance, I think of it as a weekly active explorer is a combination of how many monthly active users we have, what percentage of those monthly active users are coming into our app on a weekly basis, and then lastly, what percentage of those weekly active users are actually exploring. That way, when I see my north star metric go up and down, I can kind of immediately pinpoint, &amp;quot;Oh, monthly active users is down. It&amp;#x27;s Christmastime, but the people who are actually here, they&amp;#x27;re searching, they&amp;#x27;re coming into the app frequently.&amp;quot; That&amp;#x27;s something where I say, &amp;quot;Okay. No worries.&amp;quot; It just gives you a head start and a little bit of clarity in terms of what to look for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. It seems like you still have to contextualize the data elsewhere though, understanding what other factors might be at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, absolutely. Kind of thinking about this in the positive light of what happens when your north star metric goes up, this is something that we look at really closely when it comes to things like feature launches or big, drastic changes in a product. An example for this for FullStory is a few months ago, we launched a feature called Custom Events. We noticed that our customers that were using the feature were actually performing better on the north star metric than our customers who weren&amp;#x27;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;That in and of itself was like, &amp;quot;Great. We released something that we wanted to change our north star metric, and it did.&amp;quot; What was really enlightening for us was actually looking at the KPI tree and figuring out why the weekly active explorer numbers were going up. That was when we found super quickly, because we already have, I guess, like a framework for analyzing these things, &amp;quot;Oh, these were actually never before seen users that were coming into our customers&amp;#x27; apps and using FullStory now because they wanted to use this new functionality.&amp;quot; That was something that was like, I guess, a great product metric win for us, being able to predict what would happen and then actually see it happen in our metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. I love that. If anyone who&amp;#x27;s viewing has any product metric wins you&amp;#x27;d like to share, you can do that below in the comments. I&amp;#x27;m curious. If someone is watching this and they&amp;#x27;re wanting to get started maybe creating a north star metric or becoming more data-driven, what advice do you have for them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. That&amp;#x27;s a great question. Let me think about where to begin. For me, I think it&amp;#x27;s ... When I think about when I first came to FullStory, it was making sure that we had the data needed to analyze the things I wanted to analyze or start to like string all these things together, eventually bubbling up into a north star metric. A lot of times at early stage companies, you might not necessarily have an entire BI or an analytics team that&amp;#x27;s sole focus is to work on an analytics stack that people can query and draw inferences from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Mm-hmm (affirmative).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;That was something that was very big for me. I would say it&amp;#x27;s understanding what data you have and then how to get the most value out of it because even though getting the data&amp;#x27;s important, I think you&amp;#x27;ll find pretty quickly that there&amp;#x27;s a plethora of things you can analyze. It&amp;#x27;s really about asking the right questions and figuring out what you want to track. I think that all goes back to the customer, trying to understand who are the people that you&amp;#x27;re trying to serve and what do I need to know to best serve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. You sort of start with that perspective of understanding your customer and then using that to say, &amp;quot;Okay. What are the questions that I care about? And then how can I answer those questions with data?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yes, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Okay. Cool. That makes a lot of sense. You mentioned tech stack. What is in your tech stack that you love for understanding your users and metrics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, for sure. I don&amp;#x27;t think this is going to surprise anyone, but I am a very big FullStory user, both the actual UI and I&amp;#x27;m a heavy power user of our data export feature, which is kind of like the raw data underlying everything that you might analyze in the app. I also have a SQL background from Accenture, so I love using BigQuery. That&amp;#x27;s kind of the, I guess, analytics warehouse that we use to take things from not just product engagement data, but things like Salesforce, customer support tickets, customer segmentation data, kind of everything I can meld together in that type of environment. Then we also have Looker that sits on top of that. It&amp;#x27;s been super helpful, honestly not as much from the data visualization side, but more of just like how is our business logic to convert all of this disparate data into actual insights. Looker kind of houses that for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. That&amp;#x27;s awesome. I think from my perspective, I know that I&amp;#x27;ve gotten to work with you on some data projects and saying, &amp;quot;When are we launching features? How are people engaging with this? What&amp;#x27;s happening?&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#x27;s been really exciting to see you roll out north star metrics here at FullStory. I think it&amp;#x27;s created a lot of clarity around what are people doing on our app and what do we want to truly be tracking towards. I think as an observer of that, I can recognize the value of using data to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. That&amp;#x27;s definitely great to hear. The north star metric has definitely been super enlightening for me. I almost saw it as like product management tech debt. As opposed to being kind of reactionary every single time we heard of something or something was going on, we now are at least monitoring what we feel is the right thing and responding appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, definitely. That&amp;#x27;s awesome. We&amp;#x27;re going to turn to the audience now. If you have any questions, please feel free to drop them in the comment section. We did have a comment. I think this is great. It said, &amp;quot;The age old question. No one grew up wanting to be a product manager&amp;quot;, which that certainly seemed to be your experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. I would definitely say so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Do you have any advice for people who maybe are considering a career in product management?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, for sure. I definitely took one route to product management. I went to consulting and then business school and transferred in here, but I almost think that one of the better ways to do it is just to go ahead and actually get in the companies that have product management positions, even if you&amp;#x27;re not going to be a product manager. Just show them that you are, I guess, the right person for it. There&amp;#x27;s definitely no right way to get into the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, definitely. We talked a little bit about someone who&amp;#x27;s just starting off measuring engagement or product metrics. What metrics would you specifically suggest a small team start off with?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. That&amp;#x27;s a great question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Is it daily active users? Monthly active users? It just depends maybe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. I definitely recommend ... Those are probably the core three I would start with, monthly, weekly, and daily. Then from there it&amp;#x27;s like knowing what type of business you are. Are you transactional-based, that maybe people just come to create a transaction and aren&amp;#x27;t really coming on a daily basis to complete tasks? That might have something different. You might be tracking transactions instead of just users that are coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, definitely. What do you think the challenge is for people who are trying to create product metrics? Are there specific challenges you faced that others might be facing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Getting everybody to align on metrics is tough. You&amp;#x27;re not going to get alignment unless you prove that you&amp;#x27;re willing to listen to everyone who has something to say about it. Listening to people from different perspectives, I think, is super important. I think data is helpful, and it can help build conviction in yourself before you want to present an idea out there that you know is probably going to get poked and prodded from every single way, but listening to people, building that trust, and showing them your thought process for building up to a north star metric was super helpful for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, definitely. That makes a lot of sense. Great. Thank you so much for being here with us today. I really appreciate your time and insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Noonan: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah, absolutely. This was fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-reactroot=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hanna Woodburn: &lt;/b&gt;Yeah. Awesome. Thank you for watching. If you&amp;#x27;ve been interested in product metrics, you want to learn more, we&amp;#x27;re having a webinar with Amplitude at the end of June, so please join us for that.
